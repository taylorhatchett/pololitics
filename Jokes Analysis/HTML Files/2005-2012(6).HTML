<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have a plan to end the war in both Iraq and Afghanistan. Here's what we do. We bring all our soldiers home. We send in our investment bankers. They'll screw up the place&quot; in six &quot;months. Six months!&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is everywhere, isn't he? I mean, last week, he was on our show. Sunday night, he was on '60 Minutes.' Tuesday night, he held a primetime press conference. And last night, he was on 'Lost,' trying to sell his economic plan to the people on the island.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama&quot; held &quot;an online town hall meeting today, the first time a president has ever done that. This would allow anyone online to participate, unless, of course, you have AOL. Then you're screwed.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, he took questions from Internet users. It was interesting. ... Only three people wanted to know about the economy, only two people asked about Iraq, but 17,000 asked about his 'BFF.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was one embarrassing moment. Someone online said to the President, 'I'd like to meet with you sometime and tell you some of my ideas.' It was Joe Biden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A construction worker from Queens, New York, used Bernard Madoff's prison number to play the lottery and won. The guy won $1,500.&quot; Bernard Madoff, of course, &quot;is in prison for luring money from rich people in a giant scam that promised to make them richer. But don't confuse&quot; him &quot;with the state lottery,&quot; which &quot;lures money away from poor people in a giant scam that promises to make them richer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama has made his prediction for the Final Four. He made his prediction today. The only ones left standing after next week will be Citigroup, Chase, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The economy is so bad, &quot;I watched 'Iron Chef' the other night. You know what the secret ingredient was? Government cheese.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The economy is so bad, on &quot;Sesame Street, they won't even talk about letters 'A', 'I', or 'G' anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson is writing a book about his role in the Bush Administration during the economic crisis. It's weird. The book starts on chapter 11.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, before we get started, I want to say welcome back to Matt Lauer, our good friend from the 'Today' show. He's back at work. You might not know this. He got injured on Long Island, riding his bicycle. He almost hit a deer. He said he's going down the road, saw the deer, and the deer froze; said the deer had that 'Nancy Pelosi in the headlights look.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama has announced a task force to review the tax code. He's concerned there are too many loopholes and too many people manipulating the system to avoid paying taxes. And that's just in his administration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama said this week that things will get worse before they get better. That's something you never hear before the election, you know? 'Let me tell you, if I get elected it's going to get a lot worse!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today at the White House, President Obama met with the CEOs of all the major US banks, a lot of these big bonus guys. The CEOs looked around the White House and said, 'You live in this dump?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama gave the first official online town hall meeting over the Internet. Apparently, it must have been an online mix-up, because two guys from&quot; &quot;Dateline's To Catch a Predator&quot; showed &quot;up with a six pack of Mike's Hard Lemonade.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the postmaster general of the United States said that the post office lost $2.8 billion last year. ... Here's the worst part. Do you know where it got lost? In the mail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, losing $2.8 billion in this economy? That's a successful business now. Hey, AIG lost $2.8 billion while I was telling that joke.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;China has proposed replacing the US dollar with a new global currency, the Wal-Mart gift certificate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said this week, he is not running for anything in 2010. ... Do you know what that means? He could go back to acting. Aaaahhhh!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And tomorrow, 84 countries around the world will participate in Earth Hour to conserve electricity. All over the world, lights will be dimmed or turned off, from the Pyramids to the Eiffel Tower to the Sears Tower. I'm going to watch all the coverage on my big screen plasma TV.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wait a minute, Earth Hour. Didn't it used to be Earth Day? Now it's down to an hour? What are we telling our planet? 'We're just not that into you. Just not that into you, planet.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in an unusual move for a sitting secretary of state, Hillary Clinton was given Planned Parenthood's highest award. ... In her speech, she revealed her number one recommended method of birth control -- pantsuits.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Looking back at his presidential run this week, John McCain said that he got a lot of votes because of Sarah Palin. And weirdly enough, that's the same thing President Obama said.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama said yesterday that he believes that Osama bin Laden is plotting new attacks against the United States. Obama came up with this theory when he picked up any newspaper from the last eight years.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> BODY:<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big day in Detroit. You may have heard about this. The Obama Administration asked General Motors CEO Rick Wagoner to step down, and he agreed,&quot; which &quot;is good news for Obama. You know, the last time he tried to get someone to quit, it took months. And even then, he had to promise her a job as Secretary of State.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the government, Rick Wagoner was forced to resign because of poor performance. That's embarrassing.&quot; You run &quot;an organization that loses billions of dollars and then get fired by a guy who heads up an organization that loses trillions of dollars.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's the part I find odd. Now, the government didn't ask any of those Wall Street CEOs to quit. Isn't that kind of a double standard? I mean, if you build Cadillacs, you're screwed. But if your chauffeur drives a Cadillac, you're okay. Whew!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And listen to this. I guess they're going to, like, be in the car business. President Obama said the United States government will stand by your car's warranty. ... Assuming, of course, the government is still around in five years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No. But he said you can take that to the bank. Assuming your bank is still around.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in a speech in Anchorage, Alaska, Sarah Palin took kind of a cheap shot at her former running mate, John McCain. She said she couldn't find anyone to pray with during the campaign. She's not the only one. Between Jesse Jackson and Reverend Wright, Obama couldn't find anybody to pray with either.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Republican Congressman Peter King says he's very upset that Notre Dame, where he went to law school, is giving an honorary degree to President Obama, even though Obama is pro-choice. He said that giving Obama an honorary degree is putting him in an exalted position. Really? Isn't he President of the United States? You think that little certificate from Notre Dame is going to push him right over the top?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, Vin Diesel is on the show tonight, from 'Fast &amp; Furious.' Actually, in this new 'Fast &amp; Furious,'&quot; he is &quot;a little more eco-friendly. Like, he's now Vin Biodiesel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have an announcement to make. This is my last night. The White House has asked me to step down.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is crazy.&quot; The &quot;CEO at General Motors, Rick Wagoner, been there for like 30 years,&quot; but President Obama &quot;says, 'You're done, pal. Take a seat.' Bounced the guy right out of the job. ... He'll be replaced now by Jimmy Fallon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Right after the announcement,&quot; Wagoner &quot;hopped on his private jet and flew to the unemployment office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now here's a story. A guy in&quot; Brazil &quot;goes spear fishing,&quot; and &quot;he accidentally gets shot in his own head with the spear.&quot; Well, &quot;they operate on the guy. He's unconscious. They pull the spear out and he's going to be fine. And you know the first thing he said when he came to was, 'Well, that's the last time I go spear fishing with Dick Cheney.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're down to the Final Four now. And by that I mean we're down to the last four working banks in America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, President Obama announced he is using his own money to redecorate the White House.&quot; Meanwhile, he &quot;is using...taxpayers' money to redecorate the houses of AIG executives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;MTV, Music Television, is putting actual music videos back on their network. ... If it works, Fox News said they'll start doing actual news again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama is taking his first overseas trip as president tomorrow. He is headed to the G20 economic summit. And he's been rehearsing his opening line to foreign leaders. 'Hi, I'm not George Bush. Hi, I'm not George Bush.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear this? Some guy is selling a video of Joe Biden's daughter snorting cocaine. I'm not really interested in that. I mean, if I want to see video of a rambling, incoherent Biden, I'll just turn on CNN.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Biden,&quot; however, &quot;said he's so angry, he could literally pull his hair plugs out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Environmentalists say this weekend's Earth Hour was a huge success.&quot; An &quot;estimated 1 billion people&quot; plus &quot;turned off their lights, TVs, and appliances from 8:30-9:30. What's interesting is that during this hour, NBC's ratings actually went up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fox News launched a new editorial website today that is based solely on reporters' opinions, not on the facts of the stories themselves. They're calling the site Fox News.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> BODY:<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's see what's going on in Washington, or as they're now calling it, 'Survivor: Detroit!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, economists have been predicting the US auto industry would be in big trouble. See, that's why I have so many cars. I've been stockpiling. I was smart. I knew this would happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is giving General Motors 60 days to come up with strategy of viability for the American taxpayers' money. You know what GM should have said? 'Hey, you first.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, President Obama guarantees that if you buy a GM or Chrysler product and they don't survive, they will back your warranty. ... Well, that's great news for consumers. Combine the efficiency of the Federal government with the honesty of car mechanics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Imagine that, the government in the car business. What's that going to be like? Every time you hit OnStar, you get Joe Biden. 'Hi, Joe Biden.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama also said if you do buy a new car, you will be able to deduct ? that's right, I said deduct -- the sales tax from your income taxes. Or you can just take a job with the White House and not have to pay taxes at all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, this is highly unusual for the government to take this kind of action. I mean, the closest the previous administration came to getting involved in the car industry was Bush using jumper cables to jump-start Dick Cheney's heart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama left for Europe today for a meeting with the major world economic powers known as the G20. Or as they're called now, 'the Chapter 11.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you can see all these countries are not as wealthy as they used to be. Like today, the first meeting was held at a Red Roof Inn.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the first place President Obama landed was England. And British Prime Minister Gordon Brown told President Obama, 'Make yourself at home.' So Obama fired the head of Rolls Royce and Jaguar. He said, 'Get out.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, I feel confident that it'll go well, because President Obama&quot; is &quot;very good with these economic leaders.&quot; He is a very &quot;good speaker, of course,&quot; and a &quot;good speech writer. See, the problem with President Bush&quot; was &quot;when he went to the summit, any time anyone said G20, he'd go, 'Bingo!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, I don't know if anybody here is a smoker. I hope you're not. But did you know tomorrow, the single-largest tobacco tax in history goes into effect? And I was listening to the radio. I had talk radio coming in this morning. A smoker was complaining, 'This is the worst news for smokers ever.'&quot; The &quot;worst news. Really? ... Gee, I remember worse news. It was called cancer. Wasn't it, huh? Wasn't that a little bit worse than an extra buck a pack?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the number one movie in the country, 'Monsters vs. Aliens,' made over $59 million. Did much better than that other movie, 'Lou Dobbs vs. Aliens.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, happy birthday,&quot; former Vice President Al Gore, who is &quot;61 years old. And besides being Al Gore's birthday, it is also the 116th anniversary of the invention of the zipper, both of which played a major role in the Clinton Administration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm so happy you people are here tonight.&quot; Thank &quot;you very much because last night, you remember those people last night? I don't know if they were dumb, but they were very quiet. I'll tell you, last night, the audience was&quot; as &quot;quiet as a General Motors showroom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know the big story yesterday? President Obama, he goes to the GM people and he says, 'All right, look, guys, do you want any more dough? You're going to have to get rid of your CEO, that Rick Wagoner. Tell him to take a hike and literally take a hike because he's not getting a car out of here.' So he's gone. So he gets dumped. In addition to getting dumped, he receives a $20 million bonus to resign. Let that be a lesson to you other two big carmaker heads.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But&quot; Wagoner &quot;needs the $20 million because he got a GM car.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So the United States government is now running General Motors, because if there's anyone who knows anything about streamlining costs, it's the US government, ladies and gentlemen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama, by the way, is, I think, making his first presidential European...trip. And while he's there in Europe, he plans to fire the CEOs of BMW and Volkswagen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But you know what he's doing there? It's the G20 summit,&quot; in &quot;which the 20 major economic powers get together and meet. And sadly, this year, the US just missed the cut.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But...President Obama -- this is going to be big, look for this announcement. President Obama is meeting&quot; with the Queen of England. He is &quot;going to ask her if she wants America back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy birthday, Al Gore. He turns 61 today.&quot; And &quot;he ate a giant cake. Then, he remembered it was his birthday,&quot; so he ate another &quot;giant cake.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a great day for President Obama. He's making his first overseas trip. That first trip to Europe is a rite of passage. I wonder if Obama will be staying at hostels, getting a Eurorail pass,&quot; and &quot;finding passionate love in Paris.&quot; Well, &quot;I think...Obama's trip will be hilarious, like the movie 'European Vacation' with Chevy Chase.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm kidding.&quot; Actually, President Obama &quot;will get to meet Prince Charles,&quot; who is &quot;excited, because Obama has ears the same size as his.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think Obama will have a great time in London. It's a lovely place. I used to live there. There are 12 million people in London and about 500 teeth.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is asking all of us to pitch in. He says even if only 10 percent of us smoke only one pack a day, we can cut this deficit in half.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Barack Obama made his first trip as president to England.&quot; Here is &quot;my question. If the President is in England, who's running General Motors?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know by now, the government is now taking an active role in the auto business. President Obama offering hope, change, and 0% financing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what's interesting? Today, a reporter in Crawford, Texas, asked former President George Bush how he felt about General Motors and Bush said, 'You know, since I left office, I don't really follow the Iraq war anymore.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, President Obama says that GM filing for bankruptcy may be the best alternative. He said that bankruptcy is a good legal tool for a company not to have to pay creditors back, which sounds great until you realize, hey wait a minute, we're the creditors! Great, so you want to help them not pay us back. I mean, even AIG is going, 'Why didn't we think of this?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, it's pretty crazy. Look, we're bailing out Wall Street, we're bailing out banks; we're bailing out car companies. In fact, did you know there's a special box on your tax form this year you can check if you want a portion of your taxes to actually go to running the government?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And there was kind of an awkward moment yesterday as President Obama was leaving to go to the G20 summit. Hillary Clinton called and said, 'Can I run the country while you're gone? Please, can I?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thousands of people showed up in London to protest this G20 economic summit. Protesters smashed windows at the Bank of Scotland. Did you see it on the news? The banks were closed. The windows were all boarded up.&quot; It &quot;looked like our banks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama met with&quot; the Queen of England today. There was one &quot;embarrassing moment when the Obamas were meeting the Royal Family. The Queen said, 'Have you met my son, Charles?' And the Obamas turned to Camilla and said, 'Yes, how do you do?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A British genealogist who traced President Obama's roots claimed Obama is related to the Royal Family.&quot; Well, did &quot;you see President Obama standing with Prince Charles? If those ears are any indication, I think...they may be related.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And more embarrassment for the President. Just a few weeks after President Obama named Kansas Governor Kathleen Sebelius as his health and human services nominee, she now reveals she owes over $7,000 in back taxes. Another one owes. See, that's the difference between the two political parties right there. Republicans believe in no new taxes. Democrats believe in no old ones.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, you hear about this?&quot; A &quot;voice from the past, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who may run for president in 2012, that's the rumor, has converted to Catholicism. So after a number of affairs, two divorces,&quot; and &quot;three marriages, how would you like to get stuck behind him for that first confession, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And China says it wants to replace the US dollar with a new global currency. They want to move from a gold-based standard to a lead-based standard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And from the animal kingdom,&quot; it &quot;seems a loggerhead sea turtle nearly swam to the doorstep of a Florida Keys turtle hospital. This is the only licensed veterinary facility in the world that solely treats sea turtles. This turtle somehow knew to swim right up to the hospital. Isn't that amazing? Sad part, they had to turn him away when his HMO wouldn't cover the visit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By golly, you know what it is? April Fool's Day. Happy April Fool's Day, everybody.&quot; It is crazy &quot;when you think about it. Bush has only been out of office 10 weeks and he already has his own national holiday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody here got a General Motors car?&quot; Well, &quot;look out for this guy, this Barack Obama.&quot; He &quot;comes in, doesn't like what he sees at General Motors and tells the CEO, Rick Wagoner, to take a hike.&quot; Wagoner, however, got &quot;a $20 million bonus. ... But the good news is the 20 million was in GM stock.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But they got rid of Rick Wagoner,&quot; so GM has a new CEO. Frederick Henderson &quot;is the guy's name...and you wonder&quot; if they looked &quot;into this guy. He didn't come to work. His first day on the job&quot; and &quot;he didn't come to work.&quot; You &quot;know why...the new head of GM didn't come to work today? ... Carsick.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama is in London now, meeting with the G20 countries, and the only thing that they have agreed on so far&quot; is &quot;that French President Sarkozy has a smokin' hot wife!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of excitement there, though,&quot; at the G20 summit. They are &quot;giving away a door prize. ... Yeah, this year, it's Iceland.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I like to contrast what&quot; President Obama is &quot;up to and what John McCain, his opponent in the general election, is up to. For example,&quot; Obama &quot;met with 17 political leaders from 11 nations. He will attend five summits in different countries around Europe. Today, comparatively speaking, John McCain watched his 89 Caddy go through the car wash.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Britain's prime minister, Gordon Brown,&quot; asked &quot;President Obama if he ever played darts. ... And Obama said, 'Sure I play darts. How do you think I picked my Cabinet?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama visited Buckingham Palace and he met with the Queen of England, and here's what they did. They briefly shook hands and exchanged pleasantries. I mean, it was just like my honeymoon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a great day for our president, Barack Obama,&quot; who &quot;got to meet&quot; the Queen of England today. She &quot;very regally gave him a photograph of her,&quot; and &quot;he gave her an iPod! ... That's quite an unusual gift from the President. Usually he gives out...about $150 million.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is in London right now for a meeting with 19 other world leaders. This morning, he and the First Lady met Queen Elizabeth at Buckingham Palace. He gave her an iPod as a gift, which is perfect. Now she can listen to Lil Wayne on the treadmill without anyone bothering her.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Obama&quot; and First Lady Michelle Obama &quot;met the Queen of England. As a gift, they gave the Queen an iPod. I guess she can use that while she's jogging. And she likes it. She said it's so much easier to use than that giant boom box she used to carry around.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So...they gave the Queen an iPod. I remember...when&quot; British Prime Minister Gordon Brown &quot;was here,&quot; the Obamas gave him &quot;a DVD box set. So, it looks like they're saving the big gift, the Nintendo, for the Pope.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Protesters in London tried to disrupt&quot; the G20 &quot;summit. One bank was overrun with anti-money demonstrators. And they kept shouting, 'Abolish money!' ... Luckily, they were beaten back by an outraged Heather Mills.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People in England&quot; are &quot;lining up by the thousands to see President Obama, because this is really different for them. They've never seen someone like him -- a 47-year-old man with a full set of perfect teeth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the press is going crazy over&quot; First Lady Michelle Obama. They &quot;say she is the reason for the sleeveless fashion trend that is sweeping Europe.&quot; But &quot;President Bush spoke about this today. He said he is appalled by it. He said, 'Sleeveless? How does she wipe her nose?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know that over 500 administrative staff members traveled to London with the President? ... Not for the summit. They just want to be out of the country during tax time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the big G20 summit, President Obama met with the Chinese president, and they had the traditional exchanging of gifts. The Chinese do that. They exchange gifts.&quot; President Hu Jintao &quot;gave President Obama a gift made in China, and President Obama gave Hu a gift from America made in China.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And things are not going well with this auto bailout. President Obama called from England today to check on the status of it. You know Joe Biden has not sold a single car? Not one car since this whole thing started.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How's this for hypocrisy? While Congress has been chastising companies for giving out bonuses,&quot; last year, &quot;members of Congress gave out over $9 million in bonuses,&quot; paid &quot;for by...the taxpayer,&quot; to &quot;their staff.&quot; But Congress &quot;is saying they're not hypocrites because this extra money they give their staff really isn't bonus money. ... It's hush money. They just call it bonus money for legal reasons.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And months after Alaska Senator Ted Stevens was convicted for taking illegal gifts and lost&quot; his &quot;re-election, the Justice Department now wants all charges dropped. Apparently, there was such misconduct by the prosecution that he's going to be a free man and he gets to keep all the gifts. When he heard that, Rod Blagojevich announced he is moving to Alaska.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the US government has launched a website to help people deal emotionally with this economic crisis. The site is for people who experience depression, crying, and anxiety. In fact, the first person to log on the website&quot; was &quot;Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you,&quot; the &quot;economy's in rough shape. ... It's terrible.&quot; In fact, you &quot;know...Snap, Crackle, and Pop?&quot; Well, they &quot;were arrested today for selling smack, crack, and pot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to MSNBC, experts say insomnia can double your risk of suicide. Well, that'll help you fall asleep.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm so happy you people are here, because, I don't know how to explain this, but some nights we get audiences that really&quot; create problems. And last night, &quot;it wasn't really an audience. It was&quot; more &quot;like a G20 riot, is what it was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama, this guy has got guts. I mean he comes in, and I'll tell you something, I got a lot of respect for the guy, but he doesn't know what he's doing. Nobody knows what they're doing. What an incredible mess! We've never been in a mess like this but thank God, at least he's trying stuff. And a couple of weeks ago, the GM CEO, Rick Wagoner --- adios, he's gone; fired him. And I don't know. Sometimes you think is&quot; Obama &quot;going power crazy?&quot; For example, today, &quot;he fired the CEO of Hot Wheels. What...good will that do? Honestly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But this is a fascinating story. This CEO at General Motors, largest corporation in the world, most powerful corporation in the world and they said, 'Okay, you know, we'll do business with you guys, but you, take a hike.'&quot; But they &quot;gave him $20 million to step down.&quot; And &quot;I'm thinking well, we should have tried that on Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big story this week of course, President Obama and the First Lady met with Queen Elizabeth and the Royal Family at Buckingham Palace. You know why they did that? This is all part of the Obama's continuing campaign to reach out to those people without any real jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, a lot of Americans don't understand the role of the Queen,&quot; who &quot;is merely a figurehead. She wields no real political power,&quot; or, &quot;as we call it in this country, the Vice President.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know what's interesting over the years&quot; is &quot;to watch the contrasting styles of US presidents when they meet royalty. For example,&quot; President Obama &quot;always refers to the Queen as 'Her Majesty,' whereas President Bush used to call her 'The Queenster.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First Lady Michelle Obama is a huge hit in England. There was a bit of controversy when she put her hand on the Queen's back. ...You're not supposed to touch the Queen. But apparently, the Queen was not offended. In fact, the Queen took it as a gesture of friendship.&quot; But &quot;I think Michelle went a little too far when she tried to feed Camilla a carrot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well you wonder how something like this could happen, but it did at the G20 summit. The White House...listed, accidentally they say, a phone sex line for journalists seeking an on-the-record briefing call with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. This is really true. Imagine that, they tried to call Hillary and instead they got a phone sex line, to which Bill said, 'Boy, did they get the wrong number.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the protests in London turned violent this week. I saw on the news, one protestor had all his teeth knocked out. Can you imagine? Then I realized -- oh, he's English. He was probably that way before.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Barack Obama gave a stern warning to North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il to not go ahead with their plan to fire a test missile. Pretty stern warning, too. He told the North Korean leader, 'Hey, look what happened to the president of General Motors.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich&quot; was &quot;indicted on Federal corruption charges -- 16 counts.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President of the United States and the First Lady...are in France right now.

Now, I'm not a doctor but my guess is that rocket fuel is probably not good for babies.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, before we get started tonight, I want to remind any potential cabinet members you have until April 15th to not pay your taxes, okay?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, earlier this week, President Obama took on the teachers union by saying he wants merit pay for teachers and to fire the ones who do not perform well.&quot; That is &quot;pretty bold. A Democrat taking on the unions&quot; is &quot;like Rush Limbaugh going after the doughnut manufacturers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, here's some good news. Bernard Madoff,&quot; the &quot;sleaze-ball guy in that $50 billion Ponzi scheme thing,&quot; is going &quot;to plead guilty.&quot; But Madoff's lawyer is &quot;trying to get all the charges dropped by arguing that Madoff is no longer a threat to society because there aren't any rich people anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And there was a big rally on Wall Street yesterday after Citigroup reported a profit for the first two months of the year. That just goes to show you what determination, hard work, and 45 billion of our bailout dollars can do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's a sign of the times are a-changin'. The governor of Virginia has signed a new law banning smoking in bars and restaurants. In Virginia. See, that's significant because Virginia is, like, the tobacco state. That would be like the governor of California banning breast implants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And three different customers at a grocery store in Queens, New York, all bought peppers that turned out to have bags of cocaine stuffed inside&quot; them. Well, &quot;you thought spicy food kept you up all night.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you've been watching the big score over the weekend, huh? Navy 3, pirates 0. Yeah!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Navy SEALs kicked some Somali pirate booty this weekend.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you, those Navy SEALs, what incredible marksmen. They shot the three pirates without hitting the captain or any of the parrots that were sitting on the pirates' shoulders.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you this, this Captain Richard Phillips&quot; is a &quot;genuine American hero.&quot; He &quot;allowed himself to be taken hostage to save the lives of his crew. And did you know that this Captain Phillips used to be a cab driver in Boston? In fact, so were half the Somali pirates that kidnapped him.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, they asked Captain Phillips what he's going to do now. And he said he's going to Disneyland to wipe out the Pirates of the Caribbean. So I think he's a little wound up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, it's interesting, I tell you. We were off last week. And I have to admit when I first heard that a pirate in Africa had grabbed someone hostage, I thought, 'Boy, Madonna is really committed to that adoption.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And speaking of naval heroes, we have&quot; one &quot;on the show here tonight. Senator John McCain. ... Let me tell you something,&quot; McCain &quot;knows a thing or two about battling pirates,&quot; because, &quot;as a young man, he led the crew that sank the famous pirate Blackbeard's ship.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway,&quot; US Attorney General Eric Holder &quot;tried to put all this in perspective. He said this is the first act of piracy against the United States literally 'in hundreds of years.' Well, if you don't count AIG, of course.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, speaking of that, the 'New York Post' says that Bernard Madoff's wife, Ruth Madoff, may go back to using her maiden name.&quot; But &quot;I don't know if that's going to work&quot; because her &quot;maiden name&quot; is &quot;bin Laden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Barack Obama got quite a reception when he was in Europe last week. Did you see while he was visiting Germany, the crowd started chanting, 'Yes, we can! Yes, we can!' Pretty amazing, a bunch of Germans chanting, 'Yes, we can,'&quot; but that has got to &quot;make the French a little nervous, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, the big story&quot; is that the &quot;Obamas got their new puppy! How about that, huh? On Fox News, they declared that the dog is a Muslim socialist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, it's a Portuguese water dog, which sounds like something you order in a bar, doesn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, the hardest thing these days about paper training a puppy is finding a newspaper that's still in business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama's daughters&quot; are &quot;very smart. They told&quot; him &quot;they will take the same responsibility for the dog that&quot; he &quot;is taking for the economy. That way, if the dog leaves a mess in the White House, it'll be cleaned up by future generations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, this...has become a first family tradition. All the first families have had a dog. The Obamas have Bo, that's the name of the dog.&quot; The Bushes &quot;had Barney. The Clintons, of course, had Bill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This Wednesday, April 15th, taxes are due,&quot; but &quot;people who work for President Obama are busy doing their taxes for 1998, '99, 2000...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, look at this. I pick up the paper today,&quot; and according &quot;to a survey on how Americans will spend their&quot; tax returns, &quot;48% say they'll pay debts, 39% will save it, 27% will use it for everyday expenses, 11% will make a major purchase,&quot; and another &quot;11% will use it for vacation. Okay, that adds up to 136%. Okay, there's the problem right there!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, I tell you,&quot; the &quot;economy's in bad shape. ... You know Fort Knox?&quot; Well, they &quot;changed their name to cashforgold.com.&quot; That is &quot;how bad&quot; the economy is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They had a...big Easter egg hunt in Central Park yesterday.&quot; And the kids, as usual, were &quot;great at finding stuff. They ought to send them out looking for bin Laden, that's what they ought to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today,&quot; they had &quot;the big Easter egg roll on the White House lawn. They always have it on Monday after Easter.&quot; But this year, because of the economy, they &quot;almost had to cancel the Easter egg roll.&quot; At the &quot;last minute,&quot; though, &quot;the United States government borrowed a billion eggs from China.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that story,&quot; with the pirates &quot;off the coast of Somalia? Man, I mean, President Obama, this guy is getting it done, you know. He rounded up the Somali pirates&quot; and the &quot;Madoffs all in the same year. Looking pretty good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So the Navy SEAL snipers...shot&quot; three &quot;pirates.&quot; They &quot;shot them at the same time, simultaneously. I mean that is sharp shooting, ladies and gentlemen. Boom, all of them gone. I mean, something like that hasn't really happened since the last Dick Cheney hunting trip.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So the good news is the Navy sea captain from the United States...was rescued in that action. However, the pirates are still holding the ship comic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The pirates were trying to negotiate&quot; but it is was a &quot;tough deal. They were hoping to be adopted by Madonna.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you remember when President Obama was President-elect Obama and he said the kids wanted a dog?&quot; Well, &quot;they've got a dog now. And they are going to be formally introducing the dog.&quot; They &quot;chose three breeds,&quot; but two &quot;of them were eliminated because of tax problems.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Right now, the dog and Joe Biden are working out who brings in the morning paper. And then they'll make the announcement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a great day for America's first family. The Obamas finally got their puppy. ... Apparently, it took a long time because Obama had to find a dog that's paid all its back taxes.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now the new puppy is a Portuguese water dog named Bo. ... Apparently, they call the dog Bo because Michelle's father's nickname is Diddly. So Bo Diddly. It's very complicated. Settling on a name for the President's dog is like having to name one of the octomom's kids.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, reports are saying that the White House staff loved the dog. But the chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, is jealous, because until the puppy arrived, he was the cutest little guy in the White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama says his daughters will take care of the dog,&quot; but &quot;who picks up&quot; the dog's poop after the &quot;kids go to sleep?&quot; Well, that duty &quot;will fall on a low-level employee with nothing else to do. Joe Biden's going to be cleaning up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the wait...is over. The Obamas have chosen a new White House dog.&quot; It is &quot;a Portuguese water dog named Bo. Very cute dog. Their first choice&quot; was &quot;a wheaten terrier, but it was arrested for tax evasion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bo &quot;arrived just in time, because Sasha and Malia were getting tired of throwing Frisbees at Joe Biden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bo, that's a great name,&quot; although they &quot;almost named it after the other dog from the White House, Bill.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whew! Last night, I had that great new drink, the Navy SEAL. Three shots -- boom -- and you're done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said the Somali pirates...were all 'untrained teenagers with heavy weapons,' or as we call them in this country, rap stars.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, as you know by now, Captain Phillips was rescued when Navy SEALs shot and killed three of the pirates, although, according to Phil Spector's attorney, the pirates shot themselves in the head.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, there was some nice news this week. The Obamas got a new dog. ... It's a Portuguese water dog named Bo. Now, don't confuse that with what Dick Cheney had. That was a waterboarding dog. That was totally different.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, Portuguese water dogs&quot; are &quot;very intelligent animals. In fact, some White House Cabinet officials have already taught it how to get out of paying taxes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today, President Obama gave a speech on the economy, saying there would be more pain now,&quot; but &quot;hope later, to which&quot; pro basketball's Los Angeles Clippers &quot;said, 'Hey, that's our slogan.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And scientists from the University of Padova, in Italy,&quot; announced &quot;this week that baby chicks have the ability to do basic arithmetic and can add basic numbers together. ... You know, it's bad enough our public school kids can't compete with kids in China and Japan. Now we're losing to poultry in Italy? This is bad. ... We need to get better schools.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Questions To Ask Yourself Before Becoming A Somali Pirate:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. Is piracy a recession-proof industry?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. How am I at ducking sniper fire?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Is there enough swash in my buckle?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Before committing, should I temp as a pirate?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Am I doing this just to get babes?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Is there an all-inclusive meal plan?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Will I get to meet Johnny Depp?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Will I get along with Ross Ohlendorf? (Sorry, that's a question to ask yourself before becoming a Pittsburgh Pirate.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Is there more opportunity for advancement in al Qaeda?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. How's the commute from Jersey?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm glad you folks are here. We had a...tough crowd last night.&quot; In fact, right &quot;in the middle&quot; of the show, &quot;I had to be rescued by Navy SEALs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about those Navy SEALs, though? They rescued Captain Stubing, Gopher, Doc and guest star Charo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And now,&quot; there is &quot;serious trouble there off the coast of Somalia. Other pirates have vowed to avenge the death of their colleagues. Colleagues?&quot; What &quot;is this, a rotary club? What is this, a faculty meeting?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody been to the New York Auto Show this week? ... I'll tell you, I'm worried about the American automobile industry. Are you a little worried about the auto industry? Even the cars, the American cars, when you see them at the automobile show there on the turntable,&quot; they are &quot;only getting eight miles to the gallon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that Obama dog? They got a new dog. ... Yeah, a little Portuguese water dog. And the dog, as you would expect,&quot; is &quot;not house broken yet.&quot; In fact, earlier today, &quot;he left a bigger mess in the Oval Office than Bush did.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new dog in the White House. I believe there hasn't been a dog in the White House since that pack of semi-domesticated wolves that Cheney kept in his dungeon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was some very bad news today for General Motors. They've had to recall more than one million cars due to safety reasons. The one million cars were very easy to locate. No one had bought them. They're still in the show rooms.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, apparently, what's happened is that experts are saying car sales are down this year, but marijuana sales are up. ... So today, General Motors...introduced a new car made of weed, the Plymouth Doobie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I saw this today. President Obama gave a major speech on the economy and, once again, he promised Americans change, specifically pennies, nickels, dimes, and stuff like that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;General Motors is recalling 1.5 million vehicles, because they say the engines could catch on fire. ... Well, luckily, no one bought any of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new report shows that a bag of heroin can be cheaper than a six-pack of beer. That's really good news and bad news for Amy Winehouse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This pirates stuff is unbelievable,&quot; but the &quot;Obama Administration...is getting high marks for the way they handled the rescue situation this weekend,&quot; or &quot;the military did. But with all the problems we have right now, who would have guessed that on top of everything else our new president would have to deal with pirates? What's next? A dragon? Ghosts?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Scott MacIntyre,&quot; a &quot;blind contestant,&quot; was recently voted off &quot;American Idol.&quot; But &quot;he still has an inspirational story.&quot; He &quot;showed that in this country, even someone who can't see can grow up to finish eighth on 'American Idol,' and who knows, may even become governor of New York if the previous governor gets...caught with a hooker.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to MSNBC, there's a big problem with identity theft affecting electronic tax filing. People are stealing other people's identities, filing taxes in their name, and then getting their refund check. Today, half the Obama Administration said, 'That's what happened to us!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama...should get a big refund&quot; this year because he has a &quot;lot of dependents. AIG, Citibank, Morgan Stanley -- all dependents.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a lot of protests today. Thousands of people had these tea parties,&quot; during which they protested &quot;higher taxes.&quot; But &quot;here in LA, it was&quot; called &quot;the Green Herbal Double Decaf Tea Party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as you know, that captain of the merchant ship that was held...captive by three Somali pirates&quot; was &quot;rescued when the pirates were shot and killed by a group of Navy SEALs.&quot; President Obama &quot;authorized the military to use any force necessary to accomplish this. ... And today, the CEOs of Ford, Chrysler and GM said, 'We'll build any car you want.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama&quot; has &quot;lifted the travel ban to Cuba. If you do travel to Cuba, don't forget to set your watch back 50 years. Yeah, if you go back. If you're looking for a '58 Buick, that's the place to get it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is going to Mexico tomorrow.&quot; He &quot;visited Canada a couple weeks ago, then he went throughout Europe, then he went to Iraq, and tomorrow he's going to Mexico. See, this is what happens when your mother-in-law moves in with you. 'Honey, I'm going to be out on the road a couple weeks.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, according to the US Labor Department, because of the recession, the number of unemployed lawyers in this country has hit a ten-year high. So, see, there is a silver lining in all of this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what you call a bunch of lawyers sitting around out of work doing nothing? Congress!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Arlington, Virginia, the...Environmental Protection Agency&quot; is &quot;holding something called the National Bed Bug Summit. Health officials are going to offer advice on how to combat the growing problem of bed bugs. And it's being held in Arlington's Crystal City Sheraton Hotel. See, that's when you know the economy is bad, okay? When a Sheraton hotel is thrilled to be hosting the bed bug summit. 'Hey, be sure to come back in June for the big head lice symposium.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's something that caught my attention as I was leafing through the paper this morning. ... NBC is make a reality show starring&quot; former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich. This &quot;is the same network that didn't want me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the mayor of New York City,&quot; Mayor Bloomberg, is &quot;going to outlaw cab drivers talking on cell phones. And&quot; are you like me? Do you &quot;hate it when&quot; you are &quot;in a taxicab and the driver&quot; is &quot;twittering the Taliban? ... Awful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I heard this coming out here&quot; a &quot;few minutes ago.&quot; Apparently, &quot;Rush Limbaugh's dog said it hopes that Obama's dog fails.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the good news is we have a new White House dog,&quot; a &quot;Portuguese water dog&quot; named Bo. So &quot;welcome to the White House, Bo.&quot; Actually, Bo has only &quot;been there a couple of days,&quot; but he is &quot;already very busy. Earlier today, Bo hosted a luncheon for former White House dogs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know they&quot; have &quot;Bo wearing one of those electronic collars. If he strays beyond the perimeter of the White House grounds he gets a little buzz. That's to make sure he doesn't -- no, wait a minute, that's&quot; Joe Biden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama said today&quot; he &quot;wants to make the tax code so simple that even Joe Biden can understand it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've got no problem paying taxes. That's why I wasn't qualified to be in Obama's Cabinet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, hey, it's tax day today. ... It's Wednesday, April 15th. But if you don't get&quot; your taxes &quot;done in time, don't worry about it. The good news is you may be on your way to an Obama Cabinet position.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This whole pirate situation is getting out of control, right? Just can't stop thinking about it. Two more attacks yesterday. I mean, I don't understand how it works. Apparently, they pull up to the ship, they fire some shots, scare everyone off, then they climb up the side, then I guess they copy and distribute DVDs. Is that what they do?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some Americans did a very dumb thing today. They had tea party protests. They've been mailing tea bags to Congress to I guess express their dissatisfaction with taxes and government spending because nothing shakes a politician up like a complimentary bag of tea. 'Hey if you don't straighten up next year, crumpets, buddy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have a new 'border czar.'&quot; His job is to &quot;make sure nobody sneaks into the United States from Texas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know about this?&quot; Texas Gov. Rick Perry &quot;fired up an anti-tax tea party this week by saying that Texas has the right to secede from the Union if it wants to.&quot; And &quot;former President Bush, who now lives in Texas,&quot; is &quot;of course against the idea. Bush said if Texas leaves the Union, they'll be a foreign country, 'like Alaska and Hawaii.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But on the plus side, if Texas did secede from the Union, we could then invade them for the oil.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama now in Mexico.&quot; He has already &quot;met with the FWEA, the Future Wal-Mart Employees of America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, you know,&quot; Obama &quot;is the consummate politician. You see him trying to appeal to the Mexican people? Like, he even changed his slogan to 'Yes, we Mexi-can.' That's what he said today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And 'Newsweek' magazine reports that the reason there are so many of these pirate hijackings is that the shipping companies have decided it's cheaper just to pay a ransom than&quot; to &quot;change the shipping route to sail out of the pirates' way. ... So even though these are evil crooks, we give them the money anyway. It's the same way the bank bailout works.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, here's something interesting. In Philadelphia, a government program offering a $10,000 tax credit to any business hiring an ex-con had no takers. ... In fact, you know the way most ex-cons actually get jobs?&quot; They &quot;get re-elected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, well, here is something that makes me proud to be a member of the NBC family. NBC has signed disgraced former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich to star in a reality series. It's called, 'I'm a Celebrity ... Get Me Out of Here!' This is different from the show he did in Illinois. That was, 'He's an Idiot, Get Him Out of There.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the state of California says that singer Dionne Warwick owes $2.2 million in back taxes. ... I feel kind of sorry for her. I mean, if there had only been some sort of group or network of psychics she could have consulted with.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And New York Governor David Paterson announced that he will support legalizing gay marriage in New York. Well, you can understand why New York politicians are for this. Let's look at the problems. I mean, David Paterson and his affair, Eliot Spitzer with the hookers, Hillary and Bill. Straight marriages obviously don't work in New York. Let's try the gay thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;George W. Bush has reportedly landed a $7 million book deal.&quot; The &quot;book will be about his years as president and is tentatively called 'Decision Point,'&quot; because &quot;every time Bush had to make a decision, he would point to Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Signs The Government Is Spying On You:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. Your kitty has a satellite dish on his head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. At restaurant, waiter urges, 'Speak directly into the dinner rolls.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Your car's GPS unit has an awful lot of questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. 'Girl Scout' delivering your thin mints is 6'4, 270.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Keep finding underpants labeled 'Agent Morales.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Mailman warns you, 'This conversation may be recorded for quality control purposes.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. NSA sends over sexy lingerie they'd like your wife to wear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. You sing in the shower, a mysterious voice responds, 'A little pitchy.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. There's a Navy Seal hiding in your fish tank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Several times a week, you get chloroformed, stuffed in a trunk and dumped in Mexico.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of folks from out of town visiting New York City. Be careful, word of caution, word of caution. Never hail a cab, now I'm serious about this, never hail a cab that is flying a Somalian skull and bones.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you had a cab driver using a cell phone? I'm in the cab this morning coming to work and I said, 'Look, look, look. Look, do me a favor, stop talking on your cell phone.&quot; And the driver said, &quot;'I'm not talking on my cell phone, I'm on Google Earth trying to track down an oil tanker off the Horn of Africa.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, the governor of Texas, Rick Perry, said Texans are fed up with Washington. He said they might secede from the rest of America. ... If Texas forms their own country, they could be invaded by Mexico. They'll have to change their name to Texico.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear what Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, said about Obama yesterday? He called his new policies 'unsubstantial and overrated.' Then Hillary Clinton said, 'That's exactly what I've been saying.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To pay off her campaign debt, Hillary Clinton is auctioning off a day with Bill Clinton. She is. Bill says he's thrilled to do it, as long as Hillary isn't allowed to enter the auction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama&quot; is &quot;in Mexico right now. So if you want to break any laws or anything, this is the time to do it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President arrived in Mexico City this morning to discuss border security, drug-related violence, and to officiate at a wet t-shirt contest. It's spring break for him too, you know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Part of the reason the President is there is to help stop the massive flow of drugs into America.&quot; Obama's &quot;basic message is, 'Stop selling us the stuff, no matter how much we pay you.' And I don't know if it's going to work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is still paying off her $6 million debt for her unsuccessful presidential campaign. And they're doing it by auctioning off a number of things, including a chance to spend a day with former President Bill Clinton in New York City, which I think technically makes Hillary a pimp, doesn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You heard this story? Texas Governor Rick Perry said the state of Texas could secede from the Union if it wanted to. Is that what we need, another foreign country on our southern border speaking a language we don't understand? Come on!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And former President Bush wasted no time responding to this. He said, 'Wow, does that mean I get to be president again?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, even Jessica Simpson spoke out about Texas breaking away. She said, 'Hey, no way I'm dating a foreigner.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, what else? Well, President Obama is visiting Mexico this week, where he's talking to President Calderon about poverty, drugs and violence. When he's done with that, he plans on talking about the problems in Mexico, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Secretary of State Hillary Clinton says the United States is now ready to talk to Cuba. You know what that means? Apparently, we are already interviewing replacements for Texas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, you hear about this? Here's a story that writes itself. People who contribute money to help Hillary Clinton pay off her presidential campaign are being offered the chance to spend a day with Bill Clinton. ... No, that's real. All you have to be willing to do is write down everything Bill does and report back to Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it's been reported a congressional aide caught a staph infection at the congressional gym. Hey, let me tell you something. If that's all you catch from a Congressman, consider yourself lucky.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me ask you something. ... Did you even know there was a congressional gym? Have you seen your average congressman? Does Barney Frank look like he's been to the gym to you? No. I don't know who's using it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, &quot;climate experts say we should tell villagers in developing countries to reduce the amount of cooking smoke they generate to help fix global warming.&quot; As &quot;if these people don't hate us enough already. I mean, they live in mud huts, they have thatch roofs,&quot; and &quot;their clothes are made of straw. We pull up in a bunch of Humvees and SUVs going, 'Hey, you want to cut the smoke out of here.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Neiman Marcus announced they're selling a diamond-studded dog collar for $3.2 million. Well, finally it's nice to see one big company that's not out of touch with mainstream America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, I tell you,&quot; the &quot;economy's in bad shape.&quot; In fact, times &quot;are so bad,&quot; Habitat for Humanity &quot;is building a home for Jimmy Carter. That's how bad it is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Governor Paterson in New York says he wants to legalize same-sex marriages in that state. A lot of people in New York very excited. I understand Liza Minnelli&quot; is &quot;already looking for her next gay husband.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are more and more states now where you can get married if you are a gay couple. For example, Vermont. Gay couples can get married in Vermont. So that's good news for Ben &amp; Jerry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am...trying to find a state that will ban straight marriage.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier this week, there was a reunion&quot; of &quot;Bush Administration officials in Dallas, Texas.&quot; Because &quot;there is one team you want to put back together, am I right? You bet, buddy!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;George W. Bush is now in his ninth year of not being president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Barack Obama,&quot; look &quot;at the mess that was handed to this guy. How can you possibly know what you are doing? But at least he's out there doing something.&quot; Like &quot;last weekend,&quot; when &quot;the Navy SEALs picked off those Somali pirates. Yeah. It was a horrible thing,&quot; but at least the &quot;American captain is fine. But they shot and killed those guys.&quot; But it &quot;kind of made you feel good, didn't it? You thought, yeah! I mean,&quot; it was &quot;like a Dick Cheney hunting trip.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you think Barack Obama has traveled a lot as President?&quot; He is &quot;always traveling. ... And you think, well, guess what, he's living with his mother-in-law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But&quot; Obama recently &quot;went down to Mexico,&quot; where &quot;he was talking about...immigration&quot; and &quot;the drug cartels. And then he wanted to formally thank the country of Mexico for Salma Hayek.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Obama family&quot; finally &quot;got their dog, a Portuguese water dog&quot; named Bo. So far, the housebreaking &quot;has gone pretty well. The dog has not made any messes, not chewed any furniture. So already, he's ahead of Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know, if you have pets, this is something you should do. You can get a little microchip that you put, I think it clips on to their ear, so if the doggie wanders off, you can GPS them and go find them. And...they have done the same thing with Bo and they got the idea&quot; from what &quot;Hillary did...with Bill. Same kind of a thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bobby Jindal, the Republican governor of Louisiana,&quot; criticized &quot;Dick Cheney today, saying that he shouldn't question&quot; President Obama's &quot;patriotism. In response, Cheney said, 'I respect your opinion. That's cool. Hey, would you like to go on a hunting trip this week?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Despite Governor Rick Perry talking about how Texas could secede from the Union if it wanted to, 75% of the people who live there want to stay in the United States. Of course they want to stay. I mean, after spending all that time and effort sneaking across the border to get here, why would they want to leave?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And amid much criticism, President Obama has released top-secret terror memos from the Bush Administration. ... According to the memos, President Bush authorized various forms of torture, including waterboarding, sleep deprivation, and of course, the fourth hour of the 'Today' show.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And American hero, Captain Richard Phillips,&quot; who was recently &quot;captured by Somali pirates, flew home to Vermont over the weekend. Ironically, the movie on the plane, 'Pirates of the Caribbean.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congratulations to 'The New York Times,'&quot; which &quot;won five Pulitzer Prizes today,&quot; including &quot;one for breaking the call girl scandal that ended Eliot Spitzer's career. And...Spitzer won a prize for fiction, for the story he told his wife about the affair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama met with his entire Cabinet today. Well, sure, now that April 15th has passed, they've all come out of hiding.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Very exciting news. We have a Miss USA.&quot; Her &quot;name is Kristen Dalton,&quot; and she &quot;is from North Carolina.&quot; She &quot;says she's now looking forward to one day being the Republican vice presidential candidate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a lot of people thought that Miss California lost the contest when she said she was opposed to gay marriage. So, apparently, she forgot who the audience is who watches beauty pageants.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Things Overheard In The Meeting Between Barack Obama And Hugo Chavez:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. 'Is it too late for me to buy your Senate seat?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well,&quot; recently, &quot;that evil Hugo Chavez from Venezuela&quot; slipped President Obama a book that &quot;is printed in Spanish.&quot; But &quot;President Obama...does not read or speak Spanish. It would be like handing George W. Bush any book.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's hot here today in LA.&quot; In fact, it &quot;was so hot, I called up the CIA and...begged to be waterboarded.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's 'Green Is Universal' week here at NBC and we're part doing our part here at 'Late Night.' In fact, the whole monologue tonight is recycled from Friday's show.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama was in Venezuela this weekend for the Summit of the Americas,&quot; and he &quot;shook hands with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. Yeah, people are pretty upset about it. He's a socialist dictator. You don't shake his hand.&quot; Instead, you offer your hand, then pull it back and say, &quot;'Psych! Sucker.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congratulations to Miss North Carolina, Kristen Dalton, who won the Miss USA pageant last night. So, I guess Republicans now have a VP candidate for 2012.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you see that moron Hugo Chavez, the president of Venezuela, trying to use President Obama for photo-ops? Whenever the cameras were around, he'd come right up next to Obama, you know,&quot; and &quot;try to get into the shot.&quot; Anyway, it turns &quot;out Chavez is the Spanish name for Gloria Allred.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are now holding national elections in India. You know, voting over there lasts a month. They have a month of voting, which seems long for an election. Unless you're from Minnesota. Then it's like nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So many newspapers all across the country&quot; are &quot;going out of business.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as the economy lags, the Army is getting more and more selective now. The Army announced this week they will no longer accept drug addicts and felons.&quot; But the &quot;good news is there's always Congress, the NFL, and show business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Barack Obama&quot; told his Cabinet yesterday &quot;to ensure that every taxpayer dollar is spent wisely.&quot; But &quot;there was one embarrassing moment when he had to explain to the Cabinet what a taxpayer was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And&quot; Rod Blagojevich, the indicted former governor of Illinois, &quot;lost his bid to travel to Costa Rica to appear on that NBC reality show, 'I'm A Celebrity...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Thoughts Going Through The Somali Pirate's Mind While In New York City:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Maybe Madonna will adopt me.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. This would be a pretty sweet trip if it weren't for the handcuffs and jail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Why the hell are these people lining up to see Letterman?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. You charge $40 for parking, and I'm the pirate?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember those Somali pirates, those crazy guys that are hijacking boats and stuff? They got one of them here in New York City standing trial. ... And I want to tell you something, this guy thinks he's a pirate.&quot; Well, wait &quot;until he gets the bill for his New York legal team. Then we'll see...who the pirate is. That's what I say.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But they&quot; have &quot;the pirate locked up. And today, he met one of his idols, Bernie Madoff.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a journalist from 'Playboy' magazine attempted to withstand 15 seconds of waterboarding. And he's going to write all about it in an article that no one will ever read.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's 'Green Is Universal' week here at NBC. We're all getting into it. Everyone here at NBC is pitching in. Earlier today, Donald Trump announced that he's going to release his hair back into the wild.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Scientists in London are saying that the blame for global warming may go to fat people.&quot; They &quot;say the average fat person emits a ton more carbon dioxide than the average thin person.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Happy Earth Day, everybody. Yes. Today is Earth Day, or as the oil companies call it, Wednesday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, I thought this was nice. To celebrate Earth Day, a group of schoolchildren in Washington each planted a hair plug in Joe Biden's head.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even Dick Cheney...was into Earth Day. Did you see what he said today? He called for the use of only recycled water when waterboarding prisoners.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's an interesting study. Researchers in Britain announced today that global warming is caused in part by overweight people. They say obese people release more carbon dioxide into the air. No, this is real. This is real. See, all this time you used to think it was caused by coal-burning factories. Turns out it was Cheesecake Factories.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And former&quot; President George W. Bush &quot;said today he does not remember seeing any of those torture memos. But to be fair, to Bush, any memo on his desk was torture. 'I'm not readin' that.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Next month in Toronto, Canada, former President George W. Bush will debate former President Bill Clinton. ... The question of the debate -- is it worse to lie to your wife or lie to the entire country?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, this is big. They're billing&quot; the debate &quot;as 'the corn dog versus the horn dog.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And during an interview with 'The New York Post,' Rudy Giuliani said that he is against gay marriage. He feels marriage should be between a man, a woman, the other woman, and the other woman he met after that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about those Somali pirates?&quot; So &quot;they bring&quot; one of the pirates &quot;to New York City&quot; so they can put him &quot;on trial.&quot; But he will also be doing some other stuff. Like, tomorrow, &quot;he's going to ring the opening bell at the stock exchange. Friday he'll be on 'Rachel Ray' making Clams Mogadishu,&quot; and he will be the &quot;starting pitcher for the Yankees. Monday, he'll&quot; be &quot;on the 'Today' show singing 'I Dream a Dream.' And Monday night, he'll be sleeping with Madonna. That's the full schedule.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the Justice Department says they want to make an example of this...Somali pirate guy. And I thought, really?&quot; In terms of making an example, &quot;I don't think you can do much better than shooting the other three guys in the head.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And oh, speaking of things like that,&quot; classified documents that were recently released show that Dick Cheney, who a &quot;couple of year ago went nuts and shot&quot; a guy, &quot;ordered Khalid Shaikh Mohammed waterboarded 183 times. ... When do you suppose&quot; Mohammed &quot;caught on&quot; and &quot;said, 'I know this is just horse play'?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But anyway, they waterboarded&quot; Mohammed &quot;183 times, and...thanks to the information they got from this guy, via waterboarding, we were able to capture bin Laden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama has kind of a happier outlook on torture. He says instead of waterboarding terrorists, he's going to put them in dunk tanks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Dick Cheney is now criticizing President Obama, and he's saying that his recent actions around the world are 'disturbing' and 'not helpful.' ... Yeah, yeah, things were so much better when Cheney was president, weren't they?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you remember Eliot Spitzer, who was governor of New York?&quot; He &quot;had to stop being the governor of New York&quot; because &quot;he enjoyed prostitutes.&quot; Well, &quot;now, he's...talking about running again for governor in 2010.&quot; He &quot;also said he's looking forward to spending less time with his family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy Earth Day.&quot; You know, as a kid, &quot;every Earth Day...I used to wake up&quot; and &quot;run down the stairs in my footie pajamas&quot; to &quot;see what Al Gore brought us. It was just so fun. 'Look sis, it's one of those dark brown Seventh Generation paper towels. Yeah, I love those.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;General Motors is joining in&quot; for Earth Day. GM &quot;is helping out the environment by doing everything they can to not sell cars. It's working. It's&quot; a &quot;really good&quot; plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy Earth Day to everyone. ... President Obama celebrated Earth Day by flying his enormous plane to Iowa today to visit a wind power plant. There was a huge crowd on hand to greet him, partly to hear him talk about the importance of reducing our dependency on fossil fuels and partly to show their kids what a black person looks like.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know who is in town?&quot; One of the Somali pirates is &quot;on trial here in the United States.&quot; But he is not just in court. No, this pirate is &quot;everywhere.&quot; For example, this weekend, &quot;he's hosting 'Saturday Night Live.' Monday, he's attending the Tribeca Film Festival. Tuesday, he's going to launch his new fragrance. Wednesday, he's having lunch with Ruth Madoff.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But you learn a lot about the system. You know, like, people say, 'Oh, where do hospitals get the nerve to charge $10 for an aspirin?' ... See, this is why President Obama wants to do something about healthcare in this country. See, under his plan, hospital aspirin only costs a dollar maximum.&quot; Of &quot;course, there would be a $9 tax on it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wasn't that sick,&quot; but some people are, because of &quot;this swine flu,&quot; which &quot;has knocked the torture stuff right off the front page. You notice that? So, it's obvious who is spreading the swine flu. Dick Cheney.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it's interesting. They call it swine flu because they think it originated&quot; either &quot;with pigs or an AIG executive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, on Friday, President Obama was taken to a secure&quot; location &quot;in the White House after a single engine plane strayed over White House air space. As a precaution, they took the President to a place in the White House nobody even knew existed -- Joe Biden's office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you,&quot; the economy &quot;is so bad, third graders in China are being forced to get second jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And&quot; the bad economy is &quot;hitting Nashville. Nashville's in bad shape. You know Big and Rich? Now down and out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The economy is so bad, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez asked President Obama to give him the book back. He needs the money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;GM is phasing out Pontiac. ... You what that means? Another $20 million bonus for the head of GM.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're getting close to President Obama's first 100 days in office,&quot; and he has had to deal with &quot;a lot of trouble,&quot; including a &quot;global financial crisis, pirates,&quot; and &quot;swine flu.&quot; Plus, &quot;Obama's got a live-in mother-in-law. ... I'm telling you, this guy cannot catch a break.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes,&quot; Obama is &quot;marking 100 days as the leader of the free world.&quot; Meanwhile, &quot;John McCain...was putting his Glen Miller records in storage today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I think this is a first for President Obama. This weekend, he played golf,&quot; and &quot;at one point,&quot; he &quot;got stuck really deep in a sand trap. Same thing happened to George Bush. It's called Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now here's the difference between President Obama and our previous Democratic president, President Clinton. President Obama enjoyed playing a round of golf. President Clinton just enjoyed playing around.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama is a pretty good golfer. And he missed a couple of putts,&quot; or &quot;he would have broken 90. ... Speaking of a couple of putz, anybody hear anything from Bush and Cheney?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a new interview, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&quot; complained that &quot;President Obama hasn't been returning his messages. No offense Mahmoud, but maybe he's just not that into you.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know,&quot; a &quot;big holiday&quot; is &quot;coming next week here in Los Angeles and Mexico: Sicko de Mayo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See all those people on the news walking around wearing those surgical masks, huh?&quot; For the swine flu. Suddenly &quot;Michael Jackson&quot; is &quot;not so crazy, huh? Yeah! I think we owe Michael an apology.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember the good old days when we thought the only bad pork was in the Federal budget?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Give you an idea how bad it is&quot; with the swine flu, &quot;earlier today, the US took down the wall between&quot; the &quot;United States and Mexico and replaced it with a giant sneeze guard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, they say this outbreak of swine flu got its start in Mexico and then came up here. You know what Wal-Mart calls something that got its start in Mexico and came up here? Employees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They say this swine flu is pretty rough, if you happen to get it. In fact, on the news today, I heard a commentator say, 'You wouldn't wish this on your worst enemy.' People always say that about something that's really bad.&quot; But are &quot;you all hoping that Osama bin Laden&quot; or Bernard Madoff &quot;doesn't get this?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, another pilot has been taken off a plane for being drunk. This time&quot; it was &quot;an Air Canada pilot who was about to fly from London to Calgary. They took him off the plane before he could do something really stupid, you know, like fly low over Manhattan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see that, the 747 jet flying low over New York City? It caused a huge panic. ... Some government idiot thought it would be a good idea to buzz the city to get pictures of planes flying over the Statue of Liberty. But they didn't&quot; warn &quot;anybody. What's the government's next big idea? 'Hey, let's send a guy in a pirate costume to Captain Richard Phillips' house.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in a move that has stunned Washington, D.C., longtime Pennsylvania Republican Senator Arlen Specter has switched parties. He is first Republican senator to switch teams since Senator Larry Craig, I guess.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I love this. At the Summit of the Americas, the leaders of Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela all agreed that capitalism will destroy the planet. Then they all hopped in their private jets and returned to their huge palaces.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten White House Excuses For Air Force One's NYC Flyover:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. Do you want an excuse for scaring thousands of people or for wasting tax dollars on a brochure?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Air Force One also acts as 1010 Wins' 'Traffic Eye In The Sky.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Huh?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Biden had to get to New York for the 'Wolverine' premiere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. If we don't photograph the President's plane over the Statue of Liberty, who will know what the President's plane looks like over the Statue of Liberty?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. It's Bush's fault.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. You've been Howie'd!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Maybe the Statue of Liberty was too close to us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. C'mon, let's just be cool about it... everybody stay cool... we're cool, right?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Swine Flu made us crazy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the US government is saying look out for the swine flu,&quot; which &quot;apparently...comes from Mexico. Thank God we have an airtight border with&quot; that country. So, the US is &quot;going to be fine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's something else I didn't want to bring up but I have to. You folks in the balcony, be careful. You may be buzzed by Air Force One. So look out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is, I mean, this is exciting. Air Force One&quot; was in New York City &quot;and apparently nobody knew. They didn't make the call. Hello!&quot; Air Force One comes &quot;to New York City and wants to take some pictures. ...They send it right up and start buzzing New York City. I mean, isn't this something you would expect from the Bush Administration?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, they fly Air Force One up here&quot; and &quot;take a photo&quot; of it &quot;at the Statue of Liberty. Next, the Bronx Zoo.&quot; Plane had &quot;its picture taken at the Bronx Zoo. After that,&quot; it &quot;went to Yankee Stadium and had its picture taken there.&quot; And guess &quot;what, ladies and gentlemen? It's here tonight. How about a nice hand for Air Force One? It's here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama&quot; is &quot;now saying that the flyover was a mistake. If you're scoring at home, by the way, Obama still trails Bush in the mistake total by about 10,000. ... So we're okay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, tomorrow, I believe, marks 100 days for President Obama in office as the leader of the free world. Meanwhile, to give you an idea what else is going on, today, John McCain was waxing his Pontiac.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama, if you take a look at it, has accomplished quite a lot in his first 100 days.&quot; By way of comparison, take &quot;a look at George W. Bush's...first 100 days in office.&quot; This &quot;is in his memoir.&quot; So, according to that, Bush spent &quot;100 days in the Oval Office looking for the corner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you hear about Arlen Specter, the senator? He left the Republican Party and became a Democrat. What?! It's very odd, to switch teams like this. Who does he think he is, Lindsay Lohan?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Specter announced he'd become a Democrat and the Republicans are like, 'Yeah, he's been a Democrat for about 15 years.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Scientists&quot; have &quot;cloned dogs that glow in the dark. Why?! Well done, scientists! You've made it easier for Michael Vick to find dogs now!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a very bad day in America&quot; for &quot;people...who swear,&quot; because, &quot;today, the Supreme Court said that the government can continue its crackdown on TV swearing.&quot; In fact, &quot;I can't even say crackdown.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hi, I'm Jimmy. I'm the host of the show. Let's make this quick. I have to get back into my quarantine bubble.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyone here have the swine flu? You know, they say the best way to steer clear of it is to avoid congregating in large groups. Obviously, that message did not get to any of you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So far, the swine flu has been identified in at least 19 countries. Hardest hit of all is Mexico,&quot; so everyone in that country &quot;looks like Michael Jackson, with the face mask.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To help contain the spread of the disease, the US government is trying to discourage Mexicans from coming into the United States,&quot; which is pretty &quot;much what they have been doing for like the last 40 years.&quot; So that plan &quot;doesn't work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They traced the origin of the new strain&quot; of swine flu &quot;back to one little piggy who went to market when he should have stayed home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Someone at the White House made a big mistake yesterday. They flew Air Force One right over the city of New York, which scared the hell out of a lot of people. Thousands of people panicked. Some of them even evacuated their office buildings, and it was all because they wanted to get a picture of the President's plane next to the Statue of the Liberty. We have the first president ever who can use Facebook, but his staff does not know how to use Photoshop.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, have you all started making your summer vacation plans? ... I'm&quot; not sure &quot;what to do this year. I'm stuck between a Somali pirate cruise&quot; or a &quot;trip to a Mexican pig farm.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But, hey, people&quot; are &quot;very worried about this swine flu epidemic,&quot; but the &quot;best course of action&quot; is &quot;prevention. ... Like,&quot; if &quot;you go to IHOP and you order the pigs in the blanket, and you notice they're coughing,&quot; you &quot;don't want to eat that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, actually, that's a fallacy, too. They said today you cannot get swine flu from eating pork, which, of course, raises the question, so what were these guys doing with the pig?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Arlen Specter has a new reality show ? 'I'm a Republican...Get Me Out of Here!'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Seventy-nine-year-old Arlen Specter is now switching to the Democratic Party, which is a big loss for Republicans. You know, when they lose that young blood,&quot; it hurts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier tonight, President Barack Obama took an hour of TV time to address the American people,&quot; but the &quot;Fox network didn't air it,&quot; choosing instead to run &quot;their regular program 'Lie to Me,' which, I believe, was the name of the Republican response, actually.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today was President Obama's 100th day in office. ... Isn't that amazing? Actually, when you think about it,&quot; George W. Bush &quot;was president for eight years,&quot; and he &quot;never came close to spending 100 days in the office. So, we're way ahead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a new restaurant opening in Chicago called Felony Franks,&quot; which &quot;gives jobs to convicted felons. Yeah, isn't that amazing? Yeah. Imagine that, you&quot; could &quot;get your meal served to you by a former Illinois governor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The economy is so bad&quot; that &quot;today, the White House flew a Southwest plane over the Statue of Liberty.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Reasons Arlen Specter Switched Parties. [Editor's Note: Because of Letterman's bad voice, band leader Paul Shaffer read reasons 9-1.]:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. Heard the Democratic lounge's vending machine had Nutrageous bars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. When Barack smiles at you, the room just starts spinning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. GOP wouldn't give him the day off to attend Heidi and Spencer's wedding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Wanted free video iPod from Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Same reason 10 million other Republicans switched parties last November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Uhh, pirates?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. No #4 -- writer frightened by Air Force One fly-by.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. It was buried in the fine print when he switched cable providers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Wanted to hang out with a new group of white guys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Well, why wouldn't someone want to be associated with Rush Limbaugh and Dick Cheney?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A beautiful day here in New York City, wasn't it?&quot; But it was cold, &quot;so cold&quot; that &quot;I was wearing two swine flu masks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that swine flu?&quot; The government is saying &quot;forget about nonessential air travel,&quot; an example of which &quot;would be...flying Air Force One really low over New York City.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is celebrating his first 100 days in office. How about that? ... I don't care whether you're a Democrat or a Republican, this guy has really had quite a lot to deal with. I mean, let's take a look at the list -- recession, two wars, swine flu, runaway Air Force One. Crazy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tony Mendez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama's approval rating is 68%. Well, that was before he decided to attack New York.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tony Mendez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama's celebrating&quot; a &quot;productive 100 days&quot; in office. He &quot;already got Arlen Specter and Lindsay Lohan to switch parties.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today marks 100 days of President Obama being in office, which is a big deal because 100 days is when his warranty runs out. We couldn't return him now if we wanted him to.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm glad you're all in a good mood,&quot; but &quot;I'm a little bummed out today&quot; because &quot;I made a bad investment. So stupid! I opened a Chrysler dealership in Mexico City.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's the big story. Chrysler filed for bankruptcy today. But, actually, President Obama said Chrysler was forced to file for bankruptcy because even though the unions and the banks had agreed to make sacrifices,&quot; a &quot;small group of hedge fund managers refused to help out. Boy, where is that waterboarding when you really need it?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And during...his speech to the nation&quot; last night, Obama &quot;told the American people they should cover their mouths when they cough to prevent the spread of swine flu. And today, he told Joe Biden to cover his mouth whenever he talks.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, man,&quot; Biden &quot;did it again. God may have taken away Bush, but by golly, he gave us Joe Biden. You see this today? Joe Biden was on the 'Today' show,&quot; and he &quot;said he would tell his family members not to take any commercial flights and don't ride in any subway cars because of this swine flu. You know, I don't think Joe Biden's going to catch swine flu, but it's pretty obvious he has a case of foot-in-mouth disease.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who's really worried about this swine flu? Kevin Bacon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually,&quot; you &quot;don't want to panic,&quot; because &quot;the CDC says it's all about prevention. For example, they're now telling people if you do put lipstick on a pig, do not use that same lipstick on yourself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According&quot; to one of the news services, &quot;US pork producers are now lobbying the United States government to change the name of this swine flu because they say it's bad for business. And, you know, actually, they're right. You cannot catch swine flu from eating pork. Oh, sure, you can get heart disease, obesity,&quot; and &quot;high blood pressure, but not the swine flu.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the...big political story, of course,&quot; is that &quot;79-year-old Senator Arlen Specter has switched parties. We're learning more and more about exactly how this deal went down. In fact, I understand to sweeten the deal, as a signing bonus, the Democrats offered him a Life Alert and a year's supply of Ensure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Arlen Specter has been a Republican&quot; for a long time, so it has &quot;got to be tough, don't you think? I mean, for...years you're lying out of the right side of your mouth, and now suddenly you've got to start lying out the left side of your mouth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, actually,&quot; other &quot;senators are talking about jumping ship as well. There's talk John McCain may go back to the Federalist Party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thousands of women in Kenya have vowed to withhold sex&quot; until &quot;their nation's leaders stop their bickering.&quot; The &quot;women...said they got the idea&quot; after &quot;a recent visit by Hillary Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's happening more and more. The New Hampshire Senate now has passed a bill that would legalize same-sex marriage in New Hampshire.&quot; So, &quot;New Hampshire could go from the Granite State to the Tasteful Marble Countertop State.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New York City&quot; is &quot;taking every possible precaution&quot; to avoid swine flu. For example, &quot;I was over at St. Patrick's Cathedral earlier today, lighting a candle, and I happened to...notice that they have replaced the holy water with Purell.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Joe Biden got himself in a little bit of hot water because earlier on the 'Today' show, he's shooting his mouth off. He's saying that the subways in New York City are not safe because of swine flu. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, Joe, listen to this -- the subways weren't safe before swine flu.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People magazine has published its 100 most beautiful people issue. Is it me or is People magazine starting to lose its edge. Anyway, I was on the list, thank you very much, right between Arlen Specter and Susan Boyle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody see President Barack Obama's press conference last night?&quot; Well, &quot;did you know&quot; that &quot;during the press conference, three more Republicans defected?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Arlen Specter,&quot; though, has really &quot;left the Republican Party,&quot; which is &quot;like resigning from Chrysler.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess in the world of politics that's very exciting, Specter switching from the Republican Party to the Democrats.&quot; But &quot;what would be really cool for me is if I could just get my mom to switch from Leno.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Very big news today. President Obama just met with the surgeon general. He has declared that Chrysler has the swine flu.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Chrysler is going to have to declare bankruptcy! What? There's still hope that they can merge with Italian carmaker Fiat. Chrysler and Fiat? That will be awesome. Crappy cars in two languages.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Joe Biden caused panic today when he said&quot; that because of the swine flu, &quot;people should stay off subways and planes. I think the next time Biden puts his foot in his mouth, President Obama will put his foot in Biden's a@ $.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sports fans are being asked to stay home in Mexico because the flu spreads in large crowds. In New York, they're trying a similar thing at Yankee Stadium by making sure the prices for tickets are so high that no one can afford them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More than 300 schools in 14 states are closed now, 200 in Texas alone. The swine flu is like a new snow day. I would be delighted if I was a child at this&quot; time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But whenever something like this flu happens, it's important, I think, to find someone to point the finger at and usually the person who's responsible is the person who stands to benefit from it. So that is why I'm blaming the people at Purell for the swine flu. They started this. I know they did it and if they'd just come clean, I think we'd all forgive them, right?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government&quot; does not &quot;want us to call it the swine flu. They're calling it the 2009 H1N1 virus. The reason for the change is they want people to know you can still eat all the pork you want without any risk to your health, except diabetes, obesity and heart disease.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In business news after receiving billions of dollars in government bailout money, the company Chrysler ended up filing for bankruptcy protection today. Chrysler was founded in 1923 by Walter P. Chrysler, but it really took off under his younger brother, Jesus H. Chrysler, who's I guess like some kind of marketing genius.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's the latest.&quot; The &quot;White House says as of now, it is not contained. It could continue to get worse. And they were just talking about Joe Biden.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's see what's going on with Joe 'Planes, Trains and Automobiles' Biden,&quot; who got into &quot;a little bit of trouble yesterday when he suggested that people should avoid commercial flights and subways if they want to stay healthy.&quot; And today, &quot;President Obama recommended that Biden avoid microphones and TV cameras for the very same reason.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, there are now cases of swine flu in the United States, Canada and Mexico. So, see that? NAFTA does work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Supreme Court Justice David Souter announced he is retiring next month. You know who's replacing him? I was surprised. Conan. I couldn't believe it&quot; ? Conan O'Brien.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, President Obama says they're already looking hard to try and find a replacement who hasn't...paid any taxes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A vacancy on the Supreme Court. This is something we haven't seen in awhile. Let's just hope the President is better at picking a justice than the justices were at picking a president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you may have heard, the White House has a brand-new puppy. I believe his name is Arlen Specter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As I'm sure you've heard Senator Arlen Specter has switched to the Democratic Party. Yeah. Today, Obama told Republicans, 'Look, we'll give you Biden, call it even.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, President Obama said this week he is worried that the country is losing its love of learning. ... He said we need to show as much attention to science award winners as we do basketball players. Now, didn't he just install a basketball court in the White House? I guess the West Wing science lab is next on the list.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The New Hampshire Senate has passed a bill to legalize same-sex marriage in that state, which means there are now four states in which Miss California will not be vacationing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you may have heard, there was a bit of controversy involving Miss California. She said at the Miss USA pageant that she is against gay marriage and she thinks being gay is a choice that developed over time, kind of like being stupid.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For those of you who are unfamiliar with the swine flu, it's very similar to the regular flu, but...with just a hint of prosciutto.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's important to keep this sort of thing in perspective and not go crazy. The swine flu seems to be all anyone's talking about, but the truth is...something like 2 million people die from Pac-Man Fever every year alone and you barely hear a word about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm glad you're all in a good mood,&quot; but &quot;I'm a little bummed out&quot; because &quot;I made a big mistake. It was so stupid. ... I took all of my money out of the stock market and put it in a chain of HoneyBaked Ham stores in Mexico.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the latest swine flu update, the Mexican government has told its citizens to stay home, to which Lou Dobbs said, 'I've been telling them that for years!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, listen to this. 'The New York Times' is now reporting it's possible to catch swine flu from money. They say the virus can live on a $20 bill for more than 10 days. So, not only is the virus contagious, it's also very frugal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And up in Canada, Canadian officials are saying that a herd of pigs caught the swine flu from a human. They said the human involved is a pig farmer who recently visited Mexico. Well, good job by the Canadian customs officials catching that one. 'And where did you visit?' 'Mexico.' 'And what is your profession?' 'Pig farmer.' 'I see no problem. Come right in.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's crazy. First we had mad cow,&quot; then &quot;we had bird flu, and now we have swine flu. ... Do we have to check the Chinese horoscope to see what...flu is coming&quot; next?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Obama said that the country needs to remember that it is cool to be smart. Today, former&quot; President George W. Bush &quot;gave the rebuttal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And&quot; 69-year-old &quot;Supreme Court Justice David Souter said he's going to retire next month. ... Why's he retiring? I mean, he's a senior citizen. What's he going to do? He's going to sit around the house all day in his robe being judgmental, right? He might as well just stay on the job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, listen to this.&quot; Here is &quot;some good gossip. I got this off the hotline&quot; from &quot;Washington. As a replacement for Judge Souter, they say President Obama is looking for a woman, and the rumor is Hillary Clinton is on the short list. Yeah. That's got to be Bill's worst nightmare, huh? A woman who can rule on...the death penalty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, as you know,&quot; Supreme Court &quot;judge is a job for life. ... There's only one other job in Washington that's a job for life. That's on the Joe Biden Clarification and Apology Unit.&quot; And &quot;that's 24/7. That's very hectic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, just a day after saying he wouldn't go anywhere in confined places like an aircraft or a subway because of the swine flu, Vice President Biden rode a train from Washington to Delaware. You know what that means? Not even Joe Biden listens to Joe Biden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, the economy is in bad shape.&quot; The &quot;economy is so bad&quot; China&quot; is &quot;now making toys out of synthetic lead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The number two movie in the country is the romantic comedy, 'The Ghosts of Girlfriends Past,'&quot; or &quot;as John Edwards calls it, 'a horror film.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, former presidential candidate John Edwards&quot; is &quot;now admitting that Federal investigators are looking into his presidential campaign finances and the fact that he paid over $100,000 to his mistress.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama&quot; and &quot;his lovely wife, Michelle,&quot; recently &quot;went out to dinner at a restaurant.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Souter is &quot;stepping down because he said he wants to spend more time judging his family.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama spoke on the phone this weekend for 20 minutes with Mexican President Calderon on how to cooperate on fighting this swine flu thing. Afterwards, he said the people of America and Mexico have found common ground. I believe it's called Los Angeles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy Cinco de Mayo, everybody. ... Now, do you know the history of Cinco de Mayo?&quot; Well, &quot;Cinco de Mayo celebrates the Mexicans driving the French out of Mexico in 1862. See, I am so glad the Mexicans won that one. Imagine if the French had won. Mexico would not only have swine flu, they'd be rude and chain smoking, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this flu epidemic thing has become international. Mexico has filed a formal complaint against the country of China for seizing 70 of its citizens and quarantining them. China seized 70 people from Mexico, and Mexico said it was shocked. And, of course, the US was stunned. Seventy? That's more than we've seized all year. Come on!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And health officials have confirmed...the first case of the virus being transmitted from a person to a pig. ... A farmer has transmitted the virus back to a pig.&quot; Scientists &quot;say they have not been able to come up with a good explanation on how this happened and neither has the farmer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the White House announced today that Vice President Joe Biden has laryngitis. Yeah. They...said that he has a rare strain they hope lasts until 2012.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And here's an unusual story. Only in Louisiana! I love Louisiana politics. This is my favorite. A porn star named Stormy Daniels is now embarking on a listening tour of the state of Louisiana. She's considering running for the Senate. A porn star running for the Senate. Porn to politics. That's kind of a lateral move, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Federal authorities are now investigating how John Edwards spent his campaign money. Well, we know what he didn't spend it on -- condoms!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, this is true. ... A criminal grand jury is now probing whether or not Edwards illegally gave $114,000 from his political action committee to his mistress. Edwards said it was proper use of action committee money because he said, hey, he was getting plenty of action.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today, President Barack Obama promised to 'detect and pursue' American tax evaders, as opposed to his first 100 days, in which he detected and nominated American tax evaders.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The economy is in bad shape.&quot; In fact, the &quot;economy is so bad, John Edwards is giving his mistress IOUs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Miss California went to a gay wedding just for the free food. That's how bad&quot; the economy is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Good news, ladies and gentlemen. It seems as though we have the old swine flu on the run. The people down there at the CDC, Centers for Disease Control, say that it is now mild. They consider the swine flu to be mild. But they did say because today is Cinco de Mayo, today and today only, it will be spicy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They say that swine flu is not as potent as they originally thought. You know, like the Yankee pitching staff.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House says they will not be releasing the photos that the Air Force One plane&quot; recently &quot;took of the landmarks of New York City. ... I don't know what they were doing. They were putting together a brochure,&quot; but the White House now &quot;says they won't release the photos. Is it just me or is Obama bushing it up a little bit on this one?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it's nice to have&quot; someone &quot;like President Obama and his wife. Did you know this? They still take time out once a week to have a date night. ... I used to have a date night but marriage put an end to that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Obama, so far, nobody can lay a glove on this guy because he's working so hard and doing a great job.&quot; But recently, he &quot;accidentally referred to Cinco de Mayo as Cinco de Cuatro. He apologized and said he only knows about 15 words of Spanish. Big deal.&quot; George W. Bush &quot;only knew about 15 words of English.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama may choose a Supreme Court nominee by the end of the week. That's fast. ... Nothing against the President, but doesn't it worry you that it took him 10 times longer to decide on a dog?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This weekend, 'Time' magazine released its list of the world's most influential people. And my good friend Tina Fey is on the list,&quot; but &quot;so is Sarah Palin. It's weird, isn't it, how those two people are...forever connected in a way, right? Two people who are so different yet they look so much alike. It's like me and George Clooney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just read a new study that shows that obese children are much more likely to develop allergies. But here is the good news -- not food allergies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy Cinco de Mayo to uno and all. ... Cinco de Mayo is actually a bigger holiday here in the United States than it is in Mexico because we have more Mexicans here than they do there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama attended an early Cinco de Mayo event at the White House yesterday,&quot; but he mistakenly greeted guests with the phrase, &quot;Welcome to Cinco de Cuatro,&quot; which &quot;means five of four. Maybe it's the White House itself that makes people dumb.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Man, it was hot today. ... I was sweating like John Edwards waiting to watch his wife on 'Oprah.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, tomorrow, John Edwards' wife, Elizabeth Edwards,&quot; a &quot;great woman,&quot; is &quot;going to be on 'Oprah.' How many of you are going to watch that? ... How many of would you rather see her beat the crap out of her husband on 'Jerry Springer'?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They taped the show earlier in the week and they've been showing little&quot; snippets of it. And &quot;when Oprah asks about their marriage, Elizabeth says, 'Neither one of us is out the door.'&quot; But believe &quot;me. One of them is on the couch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Edwards did not come off good in this thing. ... In fact, I understand he's now looking for a third America to hide out in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as if he doesn't have enough problems already, John Edwards is now being investigated on whether or not he used campaign funds to pay his mistress hush money. Here's my question. Why can't we find hush money to keep Joe Biden quiet? Where is that hush money?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mexico's finance secretary says the swine flu outbreak is costing the Mexican economy $2.2 billion. Yeah. The good news ? that's in pesos, so&quot; it works out to, &quot;like, $1.80.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Obama held a White House Cinco de Mayo celebration this week, where he honored the Mexican people and he spoke Spanish. See, that shows you how far we've come as a country. Think about this. Where a half Kenyan/American president with an Arabic middle name can speak Spanish to a bunch of English-speaking reporters whose bankrupt newspapers are now owned by the Chinese. See what I'm saying? That's crazy. What a great country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice told a group of fourth graders that the Bush Administration never used torture to interrogate terrorist suspects. Condoleezza spoke to the fourth graders using simple, uncomplicated words that they could easily understand. Same way she explained it to President Bush. Almost verbatim.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, today, Maine became the fifth state to legalize gay marriage and the first gay couple to get married? I was surprised: L.L. Bean and the old Pepperidge Farm guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This Barack Obama&quot; has &quot;hit the ground running, am I right on that one, ladies and gentlemen?&quot; Today, he met with the presidents of Pakistan and Afghanistan. Yes, Obama &quot;took them&quot; to lunch at Ray's Hell Burger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama and Joe Biden went there yesterday for lunch&quot; as well. But there was &quot;kind of an embarrassing moment&quot; when they went in and found that the &quot;guy behind the counter taking orders was Rod Blagojevich.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's what&quot; President Obama &quot;had for lunch. He had the 10-ounce cheeseburger,&quot; he &quot;had fries, a milk shake,&quot; and he &quot;finished it off with a smoke.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President&quot; bought &quot;Joe Biden lunch. He wanted to pay him back for walking the dog every morning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama and Joe Biden made a surprise trip outside the White House yesterday for burgers. Yeah! Obama ordered a cheeseburger and Biden asked for whatever comes with the toy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After they finished the meal, Obama put the duct tape back over Biden's mouth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Paula Abdul is in the news again. Paula had the courage to reveal that she's been addicted to prescription painkillers for the past 12 years. And to Paula, I'd just like to say, 'We knew.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government is now recommending that schools stay open even if they have a confirmed case of swine flu. I love it. In one week, the swine flu has gone from the end of the world to not as bad as snow.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ooh, the big story, earlier today -- I can't wait to see the ratings on this -- Elizabeth Edwards was discussing her marriage on 'Oprah.' And this weekend, John Edwards will discuss his marriage on 'Cheaters.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There were signs that John Edwards was not the most faithful guy in the world, you know. Like, Elizabeth told Oprah that she asked John for one gift before their wedding, to be faithful.&quot; But after Elizabeth made this request, &quot;John stopped looking in the mirror and said, 'Huh? I'm sorry. Did you say something?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, 'The New York Daily News'&quot; is &quot;reporting that John Edwards' mistress is mad about all this publicity, and she is now demanding a paternity test. Well, good luck getting John Edwards to give up a strand of hair. Never happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama announced today plans to either trim or eliminate 121 programs. The programs he wants to eliminate -- Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, Bill O'Reilly...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here is something that's causing a huge controversy here in California. Our governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, says it's time to start the debate on legalizing marijuana. Yeah. He says he 'wants some pot in every pot.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, people in Los Angeles&quot; are &quot;split on this. Half want it legalized, the other half think it's already legal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, the University of California says they may start a marijuana research center. Really? I thought the University of California was a marijuana research center.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And government bureaucrats in China have been ordered to smoke more locally produced cigarettes in order to set an example for citizens and stimulate the Chinese cigarette industry. And health officials are worried that smoking could become the number one cause of death now because of this government mandate.&quot; But do you &quot;know what the number one cause of death is in China now? Disobeying a government mandate. So, you're kind of stuck.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a Georgia man is recovering in Pittsburgh after becoming the first US recipient of a double hand transplant. Got two hands transplanted from another guy. He used them for the first time today to grab his heart when he saw the bill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you may have heard,&quot; there was &quot;a little controversy&quot; when &quot;some semi-nude photos of Miss California...leaked out.&quot; The really &quot;bad news&quot; is that &quot;they were taken by John Edwards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;General Motors has reported a $6 billion loss.&quot; But &quot;once they get through bankruptcy they hope to go back making cars that nobody wants.&quot; So &quot;that will be nice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Six billion dollar loss. You know what that means? Somebody is in line for a pretty good looking bonus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody is excited about the economy getting better and you kind of feel it everywhere you go. People have a smile on their face and a spring in their step. Here's how you know the economy is actually starting to turn around a little bit. I saw Donald trump earlier today, and that thing on his head was wagging.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, General Motors reported a loss of $6 billion in the last quarter. Or, as GM calls it, 'kicking a#@!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Tennessee, lawmakers are planning to build a statue of Al Gore on the grounds of the state Capitol. They say that the new statue will look just like Al Gore, except a little more lifelike.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oprah had a big sit-down interview today with Elizabeth Edwards, the wife of former presidential candidate John Edwards.

Somehow John Edwards convinced his wife it was the mistress' fault and she seduced him. Guys, let me tell you something. Don't try this with your wife, okay? John Edwards is a politician and a trial lawyer. That means he is a professional liar. He knows how to do this. You cannot get away with this.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, John Edwards said yesterday he feels that he and his wife are getting to a better place. Yeah. Actually, she is getting to a better place. He is looking for a smaller place. Two-bedroom, furnished, off-street parking, nothing fancy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week at the White House during the Cinco de Mayo celebration, President Obama honored the Mexican people by speaking Spanish. And then Vice President Joe Biden honored the Mexican people by not speaking at all.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, did you see this?&quot; There was a &quot;lot of controversy yesterday for National Prayer Day. It seems that President Obama is the first president in recent years not to have a prayer service at the White House. But, you know, I understand that. Between Jesse Jackson and Jeremiah Wright, he hasn't had the best luck with ministers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In California, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger&quot; is &quot;calling for the legalization of...marijuana. ... He's calling his program 'Weed the People.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this new 'Star Trek,' it opens today. It revisits the original series from 1966,&quot; in which &quot;James Kirk became the Star Fleet's youngest captain when he received command of the Enterprise for a five-year mission. Five-year mission. ... Boy, that is a government job, isn't it, huh? What is it, 43 years later,&quot; and &quot;they're still not done?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know,&quot; actor &quot;Keifer Sutherland turned himself in today after head-butting a fashion designer&quot; and breaking his nose. Also today, &quot;Elizabeth Edwards asked&quot; if Sutherland &quot;made house calls.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's that time of the year again. Anybody graduating soon? ... I think about this all the time. You spend $200,000 to put your kid through college so he can listen to a commencement address from Joe the Plumber.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Star Trek' opened today.&quot; They &quot;have updated&quot; things a bit. In &quot;this one, the Starship Enterprise is hijacked by Somali pirates.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey,&quot; pro baseball player &quot;Manny Ramirez got some good news over the weekend. It seems he has taken so many female hormones, he can now legally celebrate Mother's Day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems like the drug Manny Ramirez tested positive for is commonly used for female fertility. I guess the team started getting suspicious when he stopped getting jock itch and started getting that not so fresh feeling.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Joe Biden gave a speech to fifth graders&quot; in &quot;Syracuse, New York, where he said his dog is smarter than President Obama's dog.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, how about this? State officials warned today California could be broke by July, which is great&quot; because most &quot;people thought we were already broke.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How could&quot; California &quot;be broke by July? What happened to all the money we gave them on April 15th?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the National Institute of Health is paying researchers $400,000 to cruise bars in Argentina to try and figure out why gay men engage in risky sexual behavior while drunk.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what they had over the weekend down there in Washington, DC? They had the White House Correspondents' Dinner. ... President Obama was unbelievably funny,&quot; so &quot;NBC has offered him the 10:00 p.m. slot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After the...dinner,&quot; President Obama was &quot;all excited and stuff,&quot; so &quot;he head-butted Rush Limbaugh.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the price of a postage stamp went up to 44 cents this week. Isn't that unbelievable? They said they had to raise the price because fewer and fewer people are using the mail these days. That's government thinking, isn't it? 'Hey, nobody's buying our product. Let's raise the price.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about this? Anybody ever mail anything any more? ... Well, the price of a stamp&quot; is going up to &quot;44 cents.&quot; Pretty &quot;soon, it will actually be cheaper and easier to just put a little glue on a dollar bill and stick it to an envelope.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody see the White House Correspondents' Dinner over the weekend?&quot; Vice President Joe Biden &quot;was funny. ... I mean, not shoot your buddy in the face funny. But he was funny, you know. He did what he could.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dick Cheney,&quot; the former vice president, &quot;said that President Obama went too far...with the jokes at the correspondents' dinner.&quot; By &quot;too far,&quot; does Cheney &quot;mean like waterboarding a guy 183 times?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama's national security advisor says he just doesn't know whether Osama bin Laden is dead or alive. Same thing with Larry King-- we don't know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, they don't know if bin Laden is dead or alive. I was thinking, hell, our last president didn't know if Lincoln was dead or alive, either. What are you going to do?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is big news. President Obama fired our top military commander in Afghanistan, General David McKiernan. It was a tough call to fire him, but in the end,&quot; Obama &quot;hired Joan Rivers,&quot; so &quot;I think it'll be ? I love Joan Rivers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Finally, a 12-year-old boy has officially filed to run for president of Iran. They're calling it the craziest thing to happen in Iran since a woman drove a car.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What a scandal we've had brewing here in the Golden State. You're not going to believe this,&quot; but Miss California, &quot;a beauty contestant,&quot; posed &quot;for naked pictures.&quot; Her fate was decided by Donald Trump, who owns the Miss USA pageant. Trump &quot;says Miss California can keep her crown.&quot; Actually, her &quot;trouble...started when she stated her opposition to same-sex marriage.&quot; And after noting &quot;that even President Obama does not support same-sex marriage,&quot; Trump pointed out that &quot;he personally...believes that marriage is a sacred institution between a man and a series of progressively younger women.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know how that works. In fact, John is so old, she is back to cutting up his meat into little pieces again.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Her husband Todd is a person of interest in dozens of unsolved snowmobile hit-and-runs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. State troopers have been instructed to taser Katie Couric on sight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. 'Memoir' is misspelled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Not only can she see Russia, earlier today she saw the astronauts working on Hubble.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The entire thing, plagiarized word-for-word from Artie Lange's 'Too Fat to Fish'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Cover shows her in a passionate embrace with a shirtless Fabio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Sworn in as governor with her left hand on a copy of 'Guns &amp; Ammo' magazine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Claims she had three-way sex with Michael Phelps and a stripper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. She voted for Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you remember...the old guy who was running for president? John McCain. Remember him? And the governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin. Remember Sarah Palin? That was a lot of fun, wasn't it? Well, guess what? Sarah Palin has got a deal to write her memoir. Got a deal to write her memoir, yup. I believe it's titled, 'The Book to Nowhere.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But in all fairness,&quot; Sarah Plain &quot;says she's not writing the book by herself. She has hired a guy to help. Joe the Ghostwriter is helping her. Joe the Ghostwriter, that's right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember&quot; when &quot;we all got...excited because of Michael Phelps, the swimmer. ... And then...they had a picture of him on the Wheaties box smoking weed. And uh ? no, it's not that kind of Wheaty. Well now,&quot; a &quot;stripper is reporting she and one of her friends enjoyed three-way sex with Michael Phelps. ... And I said to myself, 'Your move, Eliot Spitzer.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody graduating from high school or college right now? ... The NYU graduation speaker&quot; is &quot;Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. ... You think she looks great in a pantsuit. You ought to see her in a robe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And she told the grads, 'Work hard. Save your money. And one day you might be able to afford to attend a Yankees game.' That's what&quot; Hillary Clinton &quot;said.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's what I've heard from Washington. The Republicans are downhearted. They're disenchanted and they're worried now, the Republicans, because they're out of office, they're out of power. The Republicans are worried that the image of the Republican Party is downbeat and angry. ... And I was thinking, well if you ask me, honestly, all the fun went out of the Republican Party when Arlen Specter left. Are you like me, do you kind of feel, all right, the party's over!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, so the Republicans are angry. And I was thinking, well you know, the time to get angry might have been eight years ago, but that didn't happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what they're doing right now, while we're down here enjoying some fine American comedy? ... The astronauts got in the shuttle, and they went up and they're tightening up the Hubble Space Telescope, doing some repair work on the Hubble Space Telescope. ... And the mission is going great. Earlier today, they buzzed the statue of Liberty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the telescope&quot; has photographed &quot;landmarks on the planet. And it's fantastic because it's way up in space, and they're looking at ancient landmarks. They took a picture of the ancient pyramids -- fantastic. Also the Roman Coliseum, beautiful from space. Great Wall of China. They took a picture of Regis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, President Obama hosted a poetry slam at the White House. ... A poetry slam is when...poets stand up and read poems. They try and outdo each other. And things can get out of control. Apparently, last night, one person got up on stage and rambled on and on and didn't make any sense. And then, when Joe Biden was done, they started the poetry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's groundbreaking to have a poetry slam. It's never happened before. I think Dick Cheney once held a torture slam. ... 'There was a young man from Nantucket. I put his head in a bucket.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Drug officials are saying that because of the bad economy, the international cocaine market is suffering. ... It's not just affecting cocaine. It's trickling down. Today, Obama asked for a bailout of the tiny spoon industry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, the New York State Assembly overwhelmingly passed a bill approving same-sex marriage. And now the bill goes to the State Senate, where it will likely face a closer vote. In other words, the bill could go both ways.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the White House the other night, President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama hosted a night of poetry and music featuring musicians, authors and poets, to which President Bush said, 'Now, that's torture.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and speaking of torture, I love this. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi now says the CIA and President Bush misled her on waterboarding. Yeah. Apparently she was misled by the Bush Administration. So she spends eight years telling everybody how dumb President Bush is, and the minute they're in trouble, 'He fooled me! I had no idea! He tricked me!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, in a sudden reversal, President Obama now is fighting the release of dozens of new photos showing US personnel allegedly abusing prisoners. The matter has not been decided yet. I understand the photos are now under review from Donald Trump. ... He's reviewing them to see if they're tasteful enough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, let me ask you, have you noticed since this whole stupid topless Miss California thing started, we haven't heard anything about the swine flu? Weren't we all...supposed to be dead by now?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Does this name ring a bell -- evil Dick Cheney? ... He's in New York City. He's on another one of his stops on his 'Don't Say I Didn't Warn You Tour.' And he is in New York City.&quot; And he has &quot;one of those crazy, embarrassing New York City moments. He's driving in a cab. And it turns out the cabdriver is somebody Cheney had waterboarded. It was crazy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The NASA people have their own TV channel and you can watch what they are doing. So today, they flew up there in the space shuttle&quot; and changed cameras on the Hubble Telescope, the &quot;most powerful...telescope&quot; in the &quot;history of the world. ... And yet, even the Hubble Telescope can still not see how Larry King stays on the air.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To raise money for California, Governor Schwarzenegger says he's willing to sell some of the state's aging landmarks, like San Quentin Prison. ... So far, the only bid has come from Dick Cheney. Apparently, he wants to use it as a vacation home in the summer. 'I can just relax in the atmosphere.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain's mother was on TV last night saying she doesn't like Rush Limbaugh. I think I speak for all: John McCain's mother is still alive?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Canadian scientist was arrested for smuggling vials of Ebola into the US. And I'm telling you, this wouldn't happen if the government would just legalize Ebola. You know? Been saying this for years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama said that his Administration will not release the photographs of detainee abuse. Not because they don't want to, but because they can't get the password for Dick Cheney's camera phone.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger wants to legalize...marijuana. ... He says the taxes on it will help raise money to balance the budget. Now, see, this can go one of two ways. Either California will raise some revenue and balance the budget or California still goes broke but everybody's too stoned to care. So, you see, it's a win-win, really.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, a new study from the University of Mississippi shows that marijuana potency is at its highest level in over 30 years. Marijuana is now stronger than it has ever been. See, this is why Domino's had to start putting cheese in the crust. ... This is why they had to come out with the Double Stuf Oreos. The snacks were not keeping up...with the marijuana.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, I tell you,&quot; the &quot;economy is bad. It's in bad shape. Oh, it's bad. I saw Lou Dobbs picking up day laborers at Home Depot today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The economy is so bad, Nancy Pelosi now saying she was misled by E.F. Hutton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;NASA's hurting too. Oh, yeah. Today the space shuttle had to merge with Fiat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, congratulations to the space shuttle astronauts. They successfully installed a new camera in the Hubble Telescope. ... They had trouble with a bolt they couldn't loosen, so they radioed NASA for instructions on what to do. And here's what NASA said: 'Pull harder on the wrench.' ... Now what are they going to tell them when the space toilet breaks again? 'Jiggle the handle. Yeah, just jiggle the handle, it should be okay.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, you know, they tested this new camera. What are the odds of this? Got nine more pictures of Miss California topless; isn't that unbelievable?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's something kind of scary. You think security in Washington is so good. A Capitol Police report said that a drunken man spent several hours wondering through the Hart Senate Office Building late at night after he parked his car in the garage, staggered into the building drunk, didn't get stopped or challenged by anybody. Security didn't do anything to the guy. In fact, they first realized he wasn't a real senator when after three hours he hadn't groped anybody, raised taxes, or taken a bribe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a New York City auction house is having something unusual. It's selling a large variety of torture devices dating from the 16th century. A bunch of torture devices; said the whole thing looks like a Dick Cheney garage sale.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, let's see what's going on about that whole torture thing. Last week, Nancy Pelosi said she was never briefed by the CIA about their harsh interrogation methods. ... And then after a memo proved she was there and did get briefed, she changed her story to, 'They're lying about me. And they never told me. They didn't tell me anything.'... In fairness to the CIA, they assumed she was paying attention because she didn't blink for three hours.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the White House the other night, President Obama and First Lady Michelle hosted a night of poetry and music, featuring musicians, authors, and poets. So maybe that's a sign the economy is starting to turn around, huh? When poets start working again?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday at the White House, First Lady Michelle Obama said the White House is a place where people should feel free to speak their mind, except, of course, Joe Biden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, here's some good news, ladies and gentlemen. Signs that the economy is starting to improve. ... I got a call...from my accountant today, and he said, 'Good news, Dave. I'm starting to lose your money again.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Another sign that the economy is improving -- you know that company that makes the foreclosure signs? Well, they're going out of business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember last week they had the White House Correspondents' Dinner? ... You know who...was surprisingly funny, Vice President Joe Biden, Vice President Joe Biden. Oh, he's not 'shoot your buddy in the face' funny, but he was still pretty funny. 'Hey, hey, Larry, duck, will you? Dang!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're learning more and more about...Dick Cheney. You know when he was in office with President Bush, and they would have tours come through? Like, one time, they had a tour of Girl Scouts touring the White House. That's a great thing...to see how the government works. And they heard strange cries coming from Dick Cheney's subterranean dungeon. ... So they had to discontinue the tours. Rather than knock off the torturing, they discontinued the tours.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, anyway, Cheney went to see the Tom Hanks film, 'Angels &amp; Demons,' and through the whole movie he's screaming, 'Go demons! Go demons!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dick Cheney says that Rush Limbaugh is more of a Republican than Colin Powell. And I think, well, yeah, about 300 pounds more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger of California? ... Arnold Schwarzenegger wants to put the Los Angeles Coliseum up for sale. Selling the Coliseum is part of Arnold's new plan to sell anything he can't pronounce.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This Sunday, President Obama is receiving an honorary degree from the university of Notre Dame, or as Obama calls it, 'safety school.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a big controversy. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says that the CIA lied to her in 2003. Yeah, apparently, they sent her a document saying that her makeup looked subtle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you guys see Oprah's show today? On Oprah's show today, she gave everyone in her audience a free Chrysler dealership.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Lakers beat the Houston Rockets 89-70. This is the happiest people in LA have been to see somebody going back to Houston since George Bush left office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Los Angeles will start a water rationing in June, which means Dick Cheney will only be allowed to waterboard guys two days a week now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, another gaffe by Vice President Joe Biden. God bless Joe Biden. ... He's been our savior here. 'Newsweek' is reporting that at the Gridiron Dinner, Joe Biden started talking and accidentally revealed Dick Cheney's secret hiding place. See, there's more proof you don't need waterboarding to get secret information. Just give Joe Biden a couple of drinks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is part of our new plan. It's called 'Don't Ask, We'll Tell.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, do you know what Dick Cheney's secret location turned out to be? Under the Vice President's house. Is that really a secret, huh? You're in the basement, really? Our enemies never think to look behind the furnace. Ooh.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a Chicago company is now marketing hair products inspired by that idiot Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich. This is real. This is the new product right here. It's called Head &amp; Swindler. ... Can you read the back? It says, 'lather, rinse, impeach.' It's all right here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Nancy Pelosi now saying the CIA misled her. Misled. Doesn't that sound like the name of some beauty contestant in China? 'Please welcome Mis Led, ladies and gentlemen.' Huh, think I got a week and a half left? Huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, actually, Nancy Pelosi said she heard stories of inmates being injected with a deadly toxin that paralyzes the nerves in your face. No, that's her Botox. I'm sorry. You know, I'm so confused.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;General Motors announced they're closing over a thousand dealerships. A lot of people are blaming GM's new CEO, some guy named Barack Obama.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, as you know, President Obama spoke at a couple colleges this week. He told the graduates at Arizona State they should not lead their lives like Bernard Madoff. Well, sure, if you're going to steal money and stay out of jail, become an executive at AIG. That's how you do it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And at his commencement speech at Notre Dame, President Obama said we should be doing everything we can to prevent unplanned pregnancies, to which John Edwards said, 'Tell me about it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And California is going broke. Governor Schwarzenegger may have to sell some of the landmarks like the Coliseum and San Quentin, which is bad news if you're a Raider fan. You're losing two homes, the Coliseum and prison.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week marks the...54th anniversary of the invention of the credit card. See, before that, people practiced something called 'living within their means' -- a foolish, foolish, outmoded way of life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Classified Pieces Of Information Revealed By Joe Biden:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. Biden confirmed Vice President has no actual responsibilities.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Obama smokes in his sleep.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. When Bush ran out of pate at a state dinner, he fed Queen Elizabeth week-old taco meat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Dick Cheney once caught waterboarding himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The former Vice President Dick Cheney is in town, ladies and gentlemen, in New York city. He's here to see all of his favorite shows ? 'Phantom', 'Wicked', 'Stomp.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's something that I am very excited about. Joe Biden, the current vice president, was yakking away over the weekend. And he -- remember when Dick Cheney...was in an undisclosed location and everybody thought ? where? ... So supposedly top secret information, classified information. And Joe Biden just says, 'No, I know where he was. He was hiding under his house. ... Joe Biden is living proof that people can give up sensitive information without being tortured.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fascinating. I mean, on the other hand, you wonder about a vice president who's got a panic room. 'It's just the ice cream truck, Dick. You can come up.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, the underground dungeon is where Dick and his evil monks plotted to take over the Vatican.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, there's good news for the environment. They're cleaning up the Hudson River. ... It had gotten so bad that the salmon...actually had to swim upstream every year for their hepatitis shots.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Saturday, President Obama went to Malia and Sasha's soccer games. He rode to the games on Minivan One.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the new issue of 'Newsweek,' they're calling Barack Obama 'Spock with global sex appeal,' which is a bit of coincidence because 'Time' magazine is calling Joe Biden 'Chewbacca with fur plugs.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this is surprising. A new survey shows that the happiest Americans are elderly, male, and Republican. In other words, Republican.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, there was a private screening of 'Star Trek' at the White House over the weekend. And President Obama said he really liked the film. The best thing about private screenings, because we get to do them ? it's not like seeing it with the public, you know, where there might be some moron talking through the whole movie. In fact, that's why they didn't tell Joe Biden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, speaking of movies, Matt Damon has a new Jason Bourne film coming out. ... I guess he's a CIA agent who tells Nancy Pelosi about waterboarding. Yeah, but see, in this one, she's the one that gets amnesia. That's the twist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love this, the Federal government ...now bailing out insurance companies. Billions of our dollars are going to some of the nation's top insurance companies to keep them from collapsing. Wow, too bad they didn't have insurance!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The economy is bad. Dick Cheney was hanging people by their ankles just to catch the change that fell out of their pockets. That's how bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, last week, the FDA scolded General Mills for claiming that Cheerios lowers your cholesterol by 10%. ... Well, they're not stopping there. Today, under pressure, Captain Crunch admitted he lied about his military record.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new survey...by the Pew Research Center shows that the happiest people...tend to be older, male and Republican. ... Two words for you, Dick Cheney. Okay? ... Realize, he's peaking. This is happiest he's ever going to be now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Blink 182 on this show. Don't confuse that with Nancy Pelosi's favorite band. That's the Can't Blink 182.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, oh, you know what NASA is up to? You remember the Hubble Space Telescope. They're repairing it. The NASA astronauts went up there and they're doing a lot of work. Having some trouble. Because it's difficult. Everything is more difficult in space. You know that, right? Yeah. And they're having trouble. ... And I said, 'Well, no surprise to me that they're having trouble making these repairs. After all, these people aren't exactly rocket scientists.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know Vice President Joe Biden? ... Now they're saying...that he apparently had a couple of drinks and he was shooting his mouth off. And he announced the location of Vice President Dick Cheney -- the old Vice President -- his hiding place. ... And Joe Biden says, 'Well, I know where the heck it is. He had, like, a bunker under his house.' And I was thinking...if you're going to reveal secrets about something, why don't you reveal a secret about where bin Laden is hiding.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you're planning to be in Toronto next week, there's going to be a great event. Former President Clinton and former President George W.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are saying, 'Well, what's the point?' You know, the former presidents debating. I don't know about Clinton but for George W. Bush, it's understandable. I mean, you just can't keep a natural debater like this guy out of the game.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of Bill Clinton, by the way, he's been appointed...envoy to Haiti. ... At least that's what he's telling Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Joe Biden accidentally revealed the location of the Vice President's top secret bunker. ... The guy can't help it. But he did apologize.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, President Obama has found a way to quickly close Guantanamo Bay. He's going to turn it into a Pontiac dealership.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Joe Biden is on a trip to Bosnia, Serbia, and Kosovo. The White House is calling it 'Operation Keep Biden Away From the Microphones.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the price of gas, that keeps going up. I'll tell you how bad it is. Today, I saw Dick Cheney driving a Prius.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to...a Massachusetts educational official, 73% of the people who take the state elementary school teacher licensing test fail the math part.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's something frightening. New research found that today's cigarettes may actually be more dangerous for you than the cigarettes that people smoked 30, 40 years ago. Considering the ones they gave you 40 years ago gave you emphysema, cancer, and then killed you, I mean, that's saying something, isn't it? What do these new ones do? Give you...the bubonic plague? And then they kill you, is that what happens?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's something to think about. A new study says that legalizing gay marriage in the state of Massachusetts has pumped an additional $111 million into the state's economy. Isn't that amazing?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Both President Obama and Dick Cheney will give competing speeches tomorrow on national security and terrorism. It's kind of like 'American Idol' except one of them got voted off months ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, a bankruptcy judge has denied a chapter 11 proposal submitted by former NFL star, Michael Vick, after he filed a bankruptcy plan that allowed him to keep three cars and two houses.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here is a shocking statistic. This is shocking. One in four Americans...admit to texting while driving. The other three are illegal immigrants who are texting while driving.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if you folks have been following this, but you know at NASA how they've got the shuttle and periodically they take it up into space. ... They got a call from the Hubble Space Telescope people, who said, 'The thing is busted. Can you send a crew up there?' ... So they go up there, and...it's all fixed. The Hubble Space Telescope is fixed. And now, when they finished up, they put a sticker on the telescope that says, 'Objects may be closer than they appear.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that Dick Cheney. I mean talk about a guy who's gone crazy, you know? ... Talk about a bearcat, a bulldog. I mean, he's ? he gave a big speech today on terror in the United States and how the Obama Administration better be careful, they don't want to go soft on terror. And the speech was, I don't know, I guess it was well-received. And Cheney was so excited, at the end of the speech he goes out into the lobby and he waterboarded folks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the speech went over pretty well. I mean, Cheney was interrupted five times by applause and 50 times by people screaming, 'Stop! I'll tell you everything! What do you want to know? Just stop, please! Don't go on!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The National Archives lost a hard drive with massive amounts of valuable data from the Clinton Administration. It contained Bill Clinton's to-do list, 500 people long.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new poll, Dick Cheney's approval rating is up eight points since leaving office. Wow, I can't believe Cheney's approval rating is eight percent. That's amazing.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Michelle Obama's on the cover of 'Time' magazine this week. She says she has dinner with Barack and the kids every night, and then -- oh, it's so cute -- Joe Biden jumps up and tries to lick the plates.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former Vice President Dick Cheney has been in the news a lot this week, attacking President Obama. For eight years, this Dick Cheney never said two words, now all of a sudden he's like Regis, all over the place. He's been making so many speeches lately I'm starting to think he's not really dead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In competing speeches today, President Obama said the US went off course with practices like waterboarding. Cheney retaliated by saying he doesn't regret any of the decisions he made, and if he had to do it all over again, he would order President Bush to do exactly the same thing. And then he ate a baby.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can't believe...Dick Cheney keeps giving speech. He's appearing on TV news shows. It's like he thinks he is still president, you know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Before she left for China, reporters repeatedly questioned house speaker Nancy Pelosi about her claim the CIA lied to her. But Pelosi remained tight-lipped. She also remained tight-foreheaded and tight-eyelided.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, before she left, Pelosi told the press she's not going to have any further comments on this whole controversy about the CIA. ... She says no more talking. She's not going to say another word. Why can't we get this deal for Joe Biden?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;North Korea tested a nuclear bomb today. I don't want to say this is a big deal, but it actually knocked 'Jon &amp; Kate Plus 8' right off the front page.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Osama bin Laden's former cook -- I believe his name was Goatgang Puck if I'm not mistaken&quot; -- is &quot;coming to New York to face charges. You know, we also got his driver. ... And here's the good news. I understand we're closing in on his pool boy and his aroma therapist. Yeah, we are closing the net.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After a report that he called for shutting down Facebook in his country, the president of Iran, Mahmoud I'manutjob -- is that how you say his name? ... Ahmadinejad. He's now denying he ordered a ban on Facebook. He said, no, he did not. You know? That shows you the real power in the world is these days. Here's a guy calling for the destruction of Israel, openly supports terrorism, denied the Holocaust, and then he's accused of shutting down Facebook. 'Nuh-uh! No way, not me.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of fun stuff happening with the Republicans. John McCain's daughter, Meghan McCain, has declared that she is a 'pro-sex Republican.' That's what she said, a 'pro-sex Republican.' Don't confuse that with other Republicans like Senator Vitter and Eliot Spitzer. They like to get their sex from a pro. That's totally different.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The mayor of San Angelo, Texas, has quit because he fell in love with a Mexican man who does not have legal status in the United States. It got a little awkward when they were first going out. Like the mayor would pick him up for a date and the guy would jump in the trunk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis said getting herpes can give protection and prevent bubonic plague. Let me tell you something, okay? If you're dating people who have herpes and bubonic plague, you might get a refund from your online dating service.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today's Memorial Day. It's a three-day weekend, which means...I've been drunk since President's Day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you heard about North Korea? They've detonated an underground nuclear weapon today, so I guess they'll be ready if they're ever attacked by gophers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi is in Shanghai to debate climate change with Chinese government officials. I think she'll do fine because these negotiations always come down to whoever blinks first.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Honolulu just conducted our nation's first all-digital election. This is so cool. No voting booths, people cast their votes online or by phone. Everyone here at 'Late Night' would like to congratulate Honolulu's new mayor, a piano playing cat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ex-Secretary of State Colin Powell went on CBS to reaffirm that he's still a Republican. And just to prove it, he promised to lose an election right there on the show.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A former White House intern during the Kennedy Administration is writing a memoir about the affair that she had with President Kennedy when she was just 19 years old, or so she claims. A spokesman for the Kennedy family said that 'without any actual evidence, JFK definitely hit that.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the big story is the Supreme Court. President Obama has found his nominee. She is a Federal appeals judge. Sonia Sotomayor, I think her name is. ... A Latino woman, how about that? So, you know what that...means. Ruth Bader Ginsburg no longer the hot chick on the court.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, if confirmed,&quot; Sotomayor &quot;would be the country's first Hispanic judge. In fact, her first order of business, deporting Lou Dobbs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, the Republicans were a little disappointed. When they heard Obama said he might appoint a minority, they went, 'Oh, great, a Republican!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course they're still waiting to see where Judge Sotomayor stands on a lot of the important issues. You know, are Heidi and Spencer really married? You know, who's Jennifer Aniston dating now, huh? Should Adam Lambert have won 'American Idol'? There's so many issues that concern the American people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Judge Sotomayor said she seemed overwhelmed today, and she said it really won't sink in until she hears Rush Limbaugh say he hopes she fails.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, over the weekend you know, there was some more back and forth between former Secretary of State Colin Powell and Rush Limbaugh. It's getting nasty. I don't know, General Powell versus Rush Limbaugh. You know, unless it's a pie eating contest, I gotta go with Powell, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;North Korea tested another nuclear bomb. The fear is that North Korea will sell this nuclear weapon to some unstable, volatile world leader, you know, like Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi over in China right now. Her office says the speaker will not be bringing up human rights abuses to the Chinese. She said that she's going to try to focus on common ground with China, like the fact that they both call the CIA liars.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, John Kerry is over there with Nancy Pelosi right now. This is part of the Democrats' new plan to put all the people who say the wrong things in one place, you know? In fact, Joe Biden flying in as we speak.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the big story here in California -- California Supreme Court today upheld Proposition 8. That's the ban on gay marriage. ... They upheld the ban, which is bad news, unless you're a gay guy that doesn't want to get married, you see. Now you can go, 'Bob, the courts have spoken.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The economy's in bad shape. ... In fact, the economy is so bad, Governor Schwarzenegger had to take a second job narrating 'Hooked on Phonics' CDs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Governor Schwarzenegger, our guest here tonight. Actually, he's not...here as a guest. He's here to pass the hat. 'Da state is broke. Give generously here. Yah, we need da money here to help.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, a new study has found that having a cat makes you 40% less likely to die of a heart attack. Not that the cat could care less either way, really.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;History was made today when President Obama nominated Judge Sonia Sotomayor as the first female Hispanic justice to serve in the US Supreme court, today. Obama said this should help keep the court from leaning too far to the white.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a lot of local pride in Obama's pick because Sonia Sotomayor grew up in the Bronx. Yeah, when reached for comment, she said, 'Don't be fooled by the robes that I got, I'm still, I'm still Sonia from the block.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The California Supreme Court today upheld Proposition 8, the ban on gay marriage, but that's not all. The court also upheld Prop 9, which allows metrosexuals to continue using too much bronzer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Larry King said the one person he would most like to interview is Osama bin Laden. Not because bin Laden's so fascinating, just because they both lived in caves.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Barack Obama's in Los Angeles tonight for a huge fundraiser at the Beverly Hilton Hotel. Actually, one awkward moment -- as Obama was entering the Beverly Hilton, he bumped into John Edwards, who was sneaking out.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People in Beverly Hills had a lot of questions for the President about health care. They wanted to make sure that tummy tucks and Brazilian butt lifts were covered under Medicare.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And we're learning more and more about Supreme Court nominee Judge Sonia Sotomayor. ... She grew up in New York City, close to Yankee Stadium. And she is still a lifelong Yankee fan, which works out great for her because...the Supreme Court's next session doesn't begin until October, and by that time, the Yankees are usually done with it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me tell you something. These Supreme Court nominees have it a lot tougher being interviewed by President Obama because he used to be a constitutional law professor. So he knows what questions to ask. See, when Bill Clinton had female nominees, he just had the one question ? 'Let's see how you look under that robe.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And during her confirmation hearings, Judge Sotomayor is going to get tough questions from the senators. But I think she'll be fine. I mean, this is a woman who spent her whole life in the courtroom, so she's used to be around criminals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I read in the -- this seems a little scary -- in the paper today, President Obama had less than a one-hour warning of North Korea's nuclear tests. Yeah. Well, that's not bad when you realize he has absolutely no warning when Joe Biden's going to go off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And during a speech at a high school, former President George W. Bush said he's really enjoying the fact that he's no longer president. Hey, join the club.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the American College of Sports Medicine announced its list of the fittest cities in the United States. It's surprising -- you know what the number one fittest city is? ... Washington, D.C. Number one. Yeah. I wouldn't have guessed that. But, see, it's from all of the Democrats running away from Nancy Pelosi, and all of the Republicans running away from Rush Limbaugh. So they all stay in shape. That's how it works.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even with the recession, the price of gas continues to go up. And some economists say that's because speculators think the economy will turn around soon, and when things are good, gas prices are high. ...But you know, when things are bad, gas prices are high. ... I'm not an economist, but here's a wild thought. Maybe the oil companies are just trying to screw us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you,&quot; the &quot;economy's in bad shape. ... Today, a group of Somali pirates attacked a Gorton Fisherman. That's how bad it is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Barack Obama's in Las Vegas. So, if things go well at the table, General Motors just might make it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Meanwhile, after running out of options, Chrysler headed to bankruptcy court this morning. That isn't good. They headed there in a brand new Mitsubishi. That was even worse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On his radio show yesterday, Rush Limbaugh called supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor a 'reverse racist.' I got to hand it to Limbaugh. That guy is a reverse genius.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, last night at a fundraiser in Beverly Hills, people paid $30,000 to attend a dinner and a discussion with President Barack Obama. ... The subject of the discussion? The struggling economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me tell you something, if you spend $30,000 on dinner, aren't you legally a Republican at this point? I think so.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There were actually two fundraisers last night -- a higher priced celebrity dinner and a second, cheaper dinner. See, that's what I love about LA. Even when we all come together as one nation to support our leader and face the most difficult challenges, you never forget that there's always an A-list and a B-list.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, you know who was there? Kiefer Sutherland. I saw him down there. His job was to head-butt Joe Biden if he got near a microphone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, there was a performance by Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, which ironically is also the Democratic energy policy -- earth, wind and fire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama flew back to Washington this morning. And you can tell even he's feeling the economic pinch. Show him leaving today. Here he is getting on the plane. Can we pull out? Look at the plane. Look, see? It's Southwest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, you see that video online of the wind knocking down Joe Biden's teleprompter at the Air Force graduation? ... See, that's when you know you're talking to too much -- when even Mother Nature goes, 'Shut up. Okay? Just shut up.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big story here in California -- the Supreme Court has decided to uphold the ban on gay marriage. However, gay unions are still legal. See, that shows how little I know about this subject. I didn't even know gay people had their own union.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, actually, according to a new Gallup poll, 52% of people say they're opposed to gay marriage, 45% of people say they're in favor of it. That means the remaining 3% are for gay rights, they just hate going to weddings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama has picked Federal judge Sonia Sotomayor...as the Supreme Court nominee. So that means the Supreme Court will have seven men and two women. ... Like speed dating night at the Burbank Holiday Inn.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush will appear together in Toronto, on Friday, for a two-hour conversation, where George Bush plans on being the first person ever to lose a conversation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Illinois Senate passed a bill on Wednesday to legalize medical marijuana. The bill was passed after the state senator said, 'Come on, dude, pass it. Come on.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You could tell that the senators were determined that afternoon. They passed the same bill five times. They were just like ? 'Seriously, pass it again. That's a pretty good bill.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There were some tense moments yesterday here in Los Angeles with President Obama. A female reporter...carried, kicking and screaming, away from Air Force One after she insisted on handing President Obama a letter. They picked the woman up, forcibly, carried her away. Same thing they did when Joe Biden tried to get on the plane.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, as you know, President Obama was here in Los Angeles this week to bring his message of change...to Hollywood.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Beautiful day here in New York City, am I right? So nice today that General Motors sold a convertible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was so sunny today, that GM executives came out of bankruptcy court squinting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;General Motors filed for bankruptcy. Said they owe $175 billion, filed for bankruptcy. You know what that means, ladies and gentlemen? You know what it means, GM filing for bankruptcy? I'll tell you what it means. It means another enormous bonus for their CEO. That's what it means.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, the taxpayers are going to be lending bankrupt General Motors $30 billion. Taxpayers' money. Exactly, right. I mean, GM has become America's brother-in-law. You know what I mean?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend George W. Bush ? you remember George W. -- and Bill Clinton, Bubba -- you remember Bubba. They had a debate up there in Toronto, Canada. Up in Toronto. Yeah. The last time they were both in Canada, I think, was when they were trying to get out of Vietnam. Is that right? Do you remember? Something like that. I don't know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Were you aware of this, ladies and gentlemen, folks visiting from out of town? New York City is now presidential date USA. Huh? Yeah. Over the weekend, the Obamas, Barack and his wife Michelle, visited New York City, went to a show, then they had dinner at a restaurant down in the Village. And kind of an embarrassing moment. Did you read about this? At one point, the Secret Service -- and these guys are really jumpy, you know? They can't relax for a second. And it was very embarrassing. They jump up, they run to the table, and they wrestle a pepper grinder to the floor. Did you hear about that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then talk about another awkward moment. Barack Obama, the President, decides he's going to pick up a baby and kiss it. ... And it turned out, guess what? It was Mayor Bloomberg.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the highlight of the big weekend date for Michelle Obama, at the end of the day, she got to plant a vegetable garden in Donald Trump's hair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But you know, people get upset about everything. People are already screaming. They say, 'You know what that little date that the President and his wife went on in New York City, you know what that cost people? Twenty four thousand dollars. ... It lasted four hours and it cost $24,000.' And former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer said, 'That's about right.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dick Cheney said today, he supports gay marriage. ... I think he only supports gay marriage because he sees marriage as a form of torture, but anyway, he supports it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's also the good news that today,&quot; Dick Cheney &quot;received a marriage proposal from Sen. Larry Craig.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to congratulate General Motors' newest CEO, us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;General Motors filed for bankruptcy earlier today, but it's not all bad. I kind of like our chances. They say that the company will emerge from bankruptcy in three years or 36,000 miles, whichever comes first.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama and his wife Michelle had a date night Saturday and they flew here to New York to see a Broadway play. Meanwhile, Sasha and Malia stayed home and watched 'High School Musical 3' with Joe Biden.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Joe Biden's busy. Last night in New York City, Vice President Joe Biden gave a speech at a $1,000 a plate fundraising dinner. Yeah. Yeah, and since Biden spoke before dinner, everyone's still waiting to eat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is back in the news. That's right. In a recent interview, former President Bush said that no longer being president is a, quote, liberating feeling. Yep. That's what he said, yeah.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Messages on Dick Cheney's Answering Machine:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. 'Was waterboarding just an excuse for you to see hot, soaking wet dudes?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. 'You feelin' okay?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. 'Hey, it's Rumsfeld -- do you think anyone knows about us?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. 'Is your Tony Awards party still on for Sunday?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. 'This is Blockbuster. Your copy of 'The Good, The Bad and The Oily' is nine days late.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. 'Loved the window treatments in your secret bunker.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. 'Hi, this is Kevin. How'd you like a heart attack you'll never forget?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. 'Thanks for condoning same-sex marriage, but could you do it without the sneer?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. 'Senator Larry Craig here. I knew it...'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. 'Hi, I'm looking for Dick.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that Dick Cheney? Do you remember Dick Cheney? Now here's a guy we didn't really think much about until he goes hunting one day. And everything changed. I mean, he became Dick 'Kaboom' Cheney. He is now saying that Saddam Hussein had no connection with 9/11. Well, no harm done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Cheney now is criticizing the Obama Administration because they're trying to close Guantanamo Bay. ... He says they don't have a clear plan for closing Gitmo. That's what Cheney says to the Obama Administration. And I was thinking, well, you know, Cheney is right, because that Iraq war thing was so well thought out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Then Cheney is on television yesterday. He's giving an hour-long speech. In the...speech, he's defending waterboarding. ... I thought, boy, that's a tough call -- would you rather be waterboarded or listen to Cheney for an hour?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then Dick Cheney said he supports same-sex marriage. And then he floated away in his house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, how about General Motors? Oh, my gosh. It's crazy what's going on. General Motors, bankrupt. Biggest corporation in the world and now they still want money. They still want billions more bailout money. I think I speak for all Americans when I say, 'You want more money? Wait here while I talk to the manager. I'll be right back.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What a tough week for General Motors. First the bankruptcy and then earlier today, I don't know if you heard about this, Mr. Goodwrench eloped with one of the Pep Boys. That's a true story.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This was kind of cute. You remember when President Obama, before he was elected, he said if he won the election and they moved to the White House he would get the kids a doggie? They finally got the kids a doggie and it's a Portuguese water dog and the dog's name is Bo. Today...President Obama is with the reporters. He's running through the tricks that Bo does. ... And then Bo, to show you how smart this dog is, went and retrieved a tennis ball that was hidden in some ivy. Pretty good, huh? And then Joe Biden says, 'Wait a minute. That's my job. Come on. What am I supposed to do?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know about that North Korean madman dictator Kim Jong Il. Well, there's word he may be letting go and stepping down. And apparently to get the guy to relinquish power, in order to get him to step down and leave his office, they offered him the 10:00 spot. I just heard that. And they think he could be replaced by his son, Kim Jong 'W' Il.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a big announcement in North Korea. Kim Jong Il...has named his son as his future successor. A president's son becoming president? That would never happen here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, there's a big story out of Washington. ... The President went on a date. ... We haven't seen this since the Clinton Administration. But this was different. The President went on a date with his wife.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, Barack Obama took Michelle on a date. ... He and the First Lady flew to New York City, they had a fancy dinner and...they went to see a Broadway show. ... Mr. President, I respect you, but knock it off! You're making the rest of us look bad. .... Really, this is not the kind of change that I can believe in.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apparently, the Obamas' date was fulfilling a promise Barack made to Michelle. ... He told her once the campaign was over, he'd take her to New York for dinner and a Broadway show. I like that, because it makes Obama seem like any other married guy, doing stuff he doesn't want to do because he promised the wife.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No straight guy really wants to see a Broadway show. Come on! Let's just be honest. It's true. I am sure...Obama would rather give a sponge bath to Rush Limbaugh than see a Broadway show.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most Republicans aren't unhappy with the date itself...they're just mad because it cost $100,000. ... They did their best to keep costs down, the Obamas. Well, they didn't have to pay for a babysitter, because their older daughter watches the younger daughter and then the younger daughter watches Joe Biden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm kidding! They have their dog watch Biden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, what I'm saying is some Republicans have suggested that in tough economic time the President should have chosen a cheaper date. These Republicans have to remember not everyone can just go to the airport bathroom and have a date.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The 'Dategate' scandal, it's all over the 24-hour news channels. You know, you can watch the two sides go at each other. 'The President's a bastard.' 'No, you're a bastard.' ... And I'm watching the news channels going on about it and I'm thinking when will people learn that shouting on TV is meaningless? I prove that here every night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;North Korea's Kim Jong-Il selected his 26-year-old son, Kim Jong-Un, as the next leader of North Korea. The selection process went like this, 'Hey, who's up for a vote? Just kidding, my son's going to do it. Come on.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm so glad to see things working out for Lil' Kim.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Best of luck to President Obama, who just left for his five-day trip to Egypt and Saudi Arabia. And good luck to Sasha and Malia on their first keg party. Whoo! Of course, the kegs will be full of Mountain Dew.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama's inviting Iranian government officials to the US for our Fourth of July celebration. I guess the goal is to make them go ? 'Death to America -- ah, ooh -- ah, that's nice. That one looks like a palm tree. I like the squiggly one.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you heard the news today, you know that the state of California is officially out of money. We have no money -- one day without Leno, everything goes to hell around here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Governor Schwarzenegger this morning said the 'day of reckoning is here,' but he said it with a funny accent, which means either he has a new movie called 'The Day of Reckoning' that's here this weekend or we're screwed. I'm not sure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They actually had to cancel summer school, because we have no money to pay for it. Most summer school programs in LA have been cancelled. It's part of a new program they're rolling out called 'Leave No Child Ahead.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not only are we out of money, we're running out of water, too. Southern California is in the middle of another drought. The Department of Water and Power this week announced that you can only turn your sprinklers on on Monday and Thursday and that the fire department is only going to be putting out fires on Wednesdays and Saturdays, I think.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight was the first of the two-night NBC News special called 'Inside the Obama White House.' They had 150 cameras inside the White House. Basically, it was 'Cribs' hosted by Brian Williams.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it was a fascinating look at the inner workings of the White House. For instance, did you know the White House has its own Build-A-Bear Workshop? I didn't.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former Vice President, current Wal-Mart greeter Dick Cheney, surprised everyone in a speech yesterday when he said that he supports a state's right to legalize gay marriage. And it only took 11 seconds on the waterboard to get him to say it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cheney &quot;also revealed that he has the largest Faberg? egg collection in the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, Cheney has a gay daughter and he said that in his mind, freedom means freedom for everyone. And then he snarled and bit an infant, but I think it was an accident.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did everyone see Brian Williams' special with President Obama that was on? Yeah? ... Anyway, there's this big NBC News special with Brian Williams, and in the special, President Obama showed Brian Williams what tricks his new puppy, Bo, could do. Isn't that cool? Yeah, in fact, Bo has already learned to sit up and beg for Federal bailout money.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of President Obama, a new book is coming out; hasn't been out yet, I think. But it's coming out.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Instead of 'dear leader,' now insists on being called 'Petey.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Hasn't stopped sobbing since Susan Boyle lost.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Hinting he wants to play quarterback for the Vikings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Republic already named his successor, Conan Jong-Il.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Having trouble getting his missile off the ground, if you know what I'm sayin.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you been following this North Korea situation with Kim Jong-Il? You know Kim Jong-Il? The guy is nuts. And he's apparently threatening nuclear missiles and so on and so forth. And he's getting to be a little older, so now he's appointed his son to take over for him when he steps down. And his son's name is Kim Jong-Un. That's his name, Kim Jong-Un. And I think the son is weird also, because he's already announcing plans that he's going to turn North Korea into a disco.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody thinks about it, you know, having a son who will one day take over. But this Kim Jong-Un...may not be that smart, because a couple of times a day he asks people over there, 'Uh, so is this North Korea or South Korea?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Talk about a guy who won't go away. How about Osama bin Laden? I mean, come on. Come on with this guy. And there's another one of those aggravating tapes that he sends out from time to time and they put them on the Al Jazeera network. There's a new tape and people say, 'Well, how do we know this is a current tape?' Well I'll tell you how you can tell that this...is a current tape. At the end of the tape, he wishes Jay luck on the new 10:00 p.m. show.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in the new tape, it's a long, crazy man, lunatic rant condemning President Obama. Oh no, wait a minute, that's Cheney. That was Cheney doing that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Very strange tape from Osama bin Laden. He claims that 'American Idol' was fixed, number one. And then he demands the release of Phil Spector.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that Dick Cheney? He's really quite busy here lately. He's talking. He says now that Saddam Hussein, listen to this, think about this, Saddam Hussein, who used to be the guy running the show there in Iraq, said Saddam Hussein had nothing to do with 9/11. Whoa. And to get that information, Cheney admits that he had to waterboard himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, Cheney's all hot about it. He says America is now less safe. He said Obama is making America less safe. And then to prove his point, Cheney...shot a hunting buddy in the face. That's exactly what he did.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But now -- and this could be pivotal -- President Obama is in Saudi Arabia. Were you aware of that? Yep, he's in Saudi Arabia. He spent the night at King Abdullah's ranch. He has a ranch there. It's the Lazy Camel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Think about this. Obama is in the Middle East trying to straighten out the world, trying to make things better than they were. And talk about pressure, talk about a guy who's being busy, talk about a guy, every move is being scrutinized. Meanwhile, on the other hand, you have John McCain.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Obama, you know, when he travels, it's a big deal. He arrived at the Saudi Arabia airport there with a plane load of staff, a plane load of press. I'm telling you, this is costing more than a date with his wife Michelle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But listen to this. Now, I knew this was going to happen. They do this to everybody. They start digging around and they get these reporters and they go nuts and they want to write books and they publish newspapers. And I think, well, why don't you just mind your own business? That's what I think. And they found out now that back in 2000, there was some marital tension in the Obama marriage. Some marital tension. Hey but, I mean, come on, who hasn't had a little marital tension? Am I right? Yeah. I am the epitome of marital tension. Just take a look at me. Take a look at the wreck I am.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rush Limbaugh said today he might change his mind about something. I'm like, what?! He said he might support President Obama's nominee for the Supreme Court. Wow! Sounds like someone got a new prescription.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Osama bin Laden put out a new audiotape today. I'm like, you're a bit behind the times, you know. We don't use the audiotape. Everyone is on Twitter now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Experts say the tape was recorded recently, because it's mostly just ranting about how Susan Boyle got robbed. 'She has the voice of an angel, dammit. You will pay for this!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's another busy day for President Obama. He's over in the Middle East. ... You can say what you like about President Obama, but he's not afraid of tough challenges. Last week, the President rescued GM. This week, he's off to the middle east. Next week, the toughest challenge yet -- trying to save 'Jon &amp; Kate Plus 8.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sooner or later, every president has to go to the Middle East. President Bush went to negotiate agreements on oil prices. President Clinton went to negotiate agreements on oil wrestling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama used the word shukran, the Arabic word for thank you, in response to a compliment from the king today. The compliment, 'I appreciate that you didn't bring Joe Biden.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, Vice President Biden was here in New York yesterday and bought a designer suit at Barney's for $2,400. I know. It's a lot but it's high quality material, made from the same fabric as his hair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new poll shows that Americans have a more negative view of Muslim countries now than back in 2002. That's because the media never reports any of the good bombings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today in New Hampshire, the state Senate approved a bill that would help legalize same-sex marriage. Yeah. Their new state motto is 'Live Free or Bi.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As part of their restructuring plan, General Motors is selling off an entire division to a Chinese company. The new division will be called General Tso's Motors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have any of you been watching this show, 'Inside the Obama White House'? It's a reality show, set in the White House. Twenty five women and Brian Williams compete for Barack Obama's love. And Congress votes them out one by one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Obamas gave NBC News unprecedented behind the scenes access to the inner workings of the White House. Last night, we got to see Obama buy a hamburger, which was interesting. Wherever Obama went, Brian Williams went with him. They showered together a couple of times and they drove around together.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tuesday, NBC's news special, 'Inside the Obama White House,' was watched by 9 million people. ... Historians say it was the most revealing look behind the scenes at the White House since Bill Clinton set up a secret webcam.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday president Barack Obama met the king of Saudi Arabia, who kissed Obama twice. ... Obama says he hasn't gotten this kind of treatment since he met Keith Olbermann.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-Il, is in the process of deciding who is going to be his successor and the most likely person is his youngest son, Kim Jong-Un. Yeah. Kim Jong-Un says he's excited but realizes he's got some awfully big women's sunglasses to fill. They're like the windshield from a Toyota.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rush Limbaugh is in the news. Last week, Rush Limbaugh said that Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor was a racist. But this week, Rush says he may support her. ... Yeah. Limbaugh says that he can't support Sotomayor until he's 100% sure she's a racist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today is the 20-year anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protest. Yeah, yeah. Or, as the Chinese government refers to it, 'Nothing Happened Day.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rush Limbaugh, you know Rush Limbaugh? The new face of the Republican Party, Rush Limbaugh. He says now, listen to this, he says now that he might support Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor. Yes, depending on how much OxyContin he can get his hands on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Limbaugh &quot;is not sure about that endorsement. However, he does wholeheartedly endorse the baby-back ribs at Chili's.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember John McCain? John McCain, he was running for president against Barack Obama? And Barack Obama right now is in the Middle East trying to settle things there. ... And by comparison, John McCain is at Applebee's, blowing on his soup.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain said he may not endorse Sonia Sotomayor. He said he may not endorse her for the Supreme Court. And then he floated away in his house. It's just fun to say.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, I think this is good news. The CIA announced that they have a new lead on Osama bin Laden. ... They think that he's been hiding out in the $2,500 dollar seats at Yankee Stadium. They think that's where he is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that Korean dictator, Kim Jong-Il? Oh my gosh, what's the deal on that guy. He's a little squirrelly, right? Am I right? And he's going to step down. He's no longer going to be running North Korea. He's turning power over to his son, Kim Jong W-Il. ... But that was a big disappointment to his other son, Jeb Il.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you noticed all of the dictators are stepping down? Castro stepping down. Kim Jong-Il. Dick Cheney. They're all taking a break.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think Dick Cheney...is getting a little wacky, because earlier today, he came out in favor of same-sex waterboarding. Dick, are you all right? Are you okay, Dick?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama right now is in Saudi Arabia. And he gave a speech, a powerful speech today on television. And it preempted Al Jazeera, the network over there, the TV network over there. It preempted Al Jazeera's number one show, 'How I Met Your Mullah.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a new Osama bin Laden tape. You know, leave us alone -- is that what you are thinking? No, a new tape. And on the tape, a videotape, it's awful. He's drunk in the cave, Osama bin Laden, eating a cheeseburger off the floor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is in Germany right now, but he was in the Middle East before that. King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia met with Obama and gave him a large, shiny medallion on a thick, gold chain. Obama said, 'Thank you, but I think you have me confused with Flavor Flav.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US government accidentally released a confidential list of exact locations of nuclear sites around the country. Authorities have no idea who was responsible -- it was Biden. Okay. It was Joe Biden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'&quot;Forbes' magazine's annual survey of the 100 most powerful celebrities is out. President Obama came in 49th. Ryan Seacrest is 44th. I will tell you why Ryan ranked higher than Obama -- after the break.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new survey ranks the United States as the 83rd most peaceful nation in the world. Not good. Not good. We were in fifth place until the season premiere of 'Jon &amp; Kate Plus 8.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The IRS says that John Kerry's 2004 presidential campaign owes over $800,000 in back taxes. I guess that explains the long face.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Finally, the 'New York Daily News' is reporting that some members of the New York Mets may be suffering from swine flu, which is scary because...usually, the Mets don't start choking 'til September.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's NBA Finals night. Game one, at ling last. The Lakers and Magic did battle tonight at the Staples Center. President Obama is said to be monitoring the situation very closely. He's calling on both sides to show restraint and work towards peace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But President Obama was in Egypt today addressing the Muslim world from Cairo University. Reaction to his speech was mixed. After it, some said, 'Death to America,' others said, 'Die, American dogs.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Iranian and some Palestinian officials dismissed his speech as all talk, which -- I mean, it was a speech. Do you want magic tricks?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big stuff going on in the world. President Obama gave a big, historic speech yesterday in Egypt. ... President Obama impressed listeners by beginning his speech with the traditional Islamic greeting, 'As-salaamu alaikum.' Yeah, it's very cool. Yeah, it was especially impressive because a year ago, President Bush opened with, 'Shalom, amigos.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, President Obama gave the historic speech at Egypt's Cairo University. Yep. Yeah, the crowd at Cairo University loved Obama's speech, especially the joke he made about their rival, Cairo State.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The favorite show to win best musical Tony this year is a show about a former vice president -- have you seen it? 'Cheney Get Your Gun.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's something kind of cool. Apparently, the Obamas -- the President and his wife, Michelle ? they, every Friday night, they have a date. Were you aware of this? Friday night is date night for the Obamas. And last week, they came to New York City, and they went to a show, and they went and had dinner at a restaurant. And I thought, oh God, now the wife's gonna get ideas. My...wife and I don't go out to restaurants. We have our staring contest at home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it's interesting, a Democratic president dating his wife. And Bill Clinton -- you know what Bill Clinton said? When he heard about that, Bill Clinton said, 'Run that by me again. What?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On this day, 1925, the Chrysler Corporation was founded. And had it lived, it would be 84 years old today.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin...got there early and she was taken to her seat, shown to her seat, by Joe the Usher.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Sarah Palin -- it was exciting, because everybody loves New York City and she spent the entire weekend here in New York City. And late yesterday afternoon, as a matter of fact, she actually pulled out her rifle, and she shot that thing on Donald Trump's head. Tremendous weekend.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big night for Angela Lansbury. She won a record fifth Tony Award. ... And she was...named acting president of General Motors. Did you know that?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor fell and broke her ankle, and she's expected to be on crutches for several weeks. ... In a related story, Republicans have announced that Sotomayor's confirmation hearing will consist of three questions and a timed obstacle course.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The first detainee from Guantanamo Bay arrived in New York City for trial. ... You know what that means? He'll be back on the street tomorrow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's crazy the way things work. They bring the guy ? he's locked up down there for four years in Guantanamo Bay ? they bring him to New York City for trial. But he's everywhere. Tomorrow, Barnes and Noble. This guy will be at Barnes and Noble, signing copies of his new book, 'Too Fat to Jihad.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Boy, this is a weird story. Supreme Court nominee Sonya Sotomayor is at LaGuardia and she breaks her ankle. ... This happened, like, two days ago. And in a 5-to-4 ruling, the current justices have voted to send her a get well card.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, yesterday, Hezbollah was defeated in the Lebanese elections. ... That's right. Hezbollah was defeated...so now they have no choice but to merge with Fiat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Iran, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is in a tight race. ... This guy is everywhere trying to drum up support. On Sunday, he was on the Iranian talk show, 'Eliminate the Press.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you think about it, we're losing short, tiny dictators. If Mahmoud Ahmadinejad loses, he's gone. And then you got Kim Jong-Il. He's gone. So then the only dictator left, tiny dictator left, will be Mayor Bloomberg.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who's in New York City? ... Sarah Palin from Alaska. Yeah, she's here. You know those sightseeing helicopters? You can take a ride around Manhattan, so she got in one of those and she was up there shooting rats.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She had a lot of fun. She visited stuff. She went to Yankee Stadium with Rudy Giuliani. They had seats in the far, far right field. They had a wonderful time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The toughest part of her visit was keeping Eliot Spitzer away from her daughter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Gore is back in the news today because President Obama is saying he might send him to North Korea to negotiate with Kim Jong-Il. ... I'm thinking if you're going to send a vice president to negotiate with a madman, why don't you send Joe Biden? At least...Biden speaks the language of crazy. He understands the ways of the bonkers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can't remember if Al Gore has a beard right now or not, because if so, that's good. It's like Robin Williams ? it's the same rule. Robin Williams, beard in the movie, it's a good movie. No beard, bad movie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's been acting up a lot lately, Kim Jong-Il. Yesterday he sentenced two American journalists to a labor camp. And a couple of weeks ago, he tested another nuclear weapon. I think he thinks he's a Bond villain. ... The next thing you know, he'll be living in a hollowed-out volcano with an army of robot skeletons and he'll be stroking a large cat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is proposing a new national healthcare plan that's both inexpensive and accessible. He's calling it Have Your Surgery In Mexico.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Scientists are now saying that children under the age of two should not watch television. Apparently, it delays language development. But I say, keep watching, kids. Keep watching.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A pastor in Kentucky is asking parishioners to bring their guns to church to help celebrate the Fourth of July and the Second Amendment. The church loves the idea. Donations have gone up 500% since they started passing the collection plate at gunpoint.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Chrysler was taken over by Fiat and the new CEO said, this is a quote, 'Going forward we intend to build on Chrysler's culture of innovation.' Yeah. Yeah, then he laughed for three straight hours.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama's in the news, of course. He's put healthcare back in the news. Yup. President Obama says he wants to create a national healthcare plan that's both affordable and easy to use. Yup. Yeah, good. Yeah, and the insurance industry says they'll fight the plan with congressmen who are both affordable and easy to use.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you all know, two US reporters have been imprisoned in North Korea, and now, President Obama is considering sending Al Gore to negotiate their release. Yeah. Yeah, and after hearing the Al Gore threat, North Korea gave up the reporters and their nuclear program.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is weird. Former President George H.W. Bush is going to celebrate his 85th birthday by once again going skydiving. Yup. And his son, George W. Bush, is going to celebrate his father's birthday the way he always does, giving him a World's Greatest Dad mug and making him a macaroni necklace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the 'Late Show', a division of Fiat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, I am in so much trouble, because ? I'll tell you why -- the governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin, is angry with me. Fuming, angry, seeing red, and has called me 'pathetic.' Yup, that's right. Honestly, I haven't been called pathetic -- well, since the honeymoon, actually.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But, I won't kid you. I was feeling a little depressed when I heard that the Governor was mad at me and called me 'pathetic.' To cheer myself up, I went out and spent $150,000 on clothes, and I feel better now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was thinking about this -- great, my luck, I pissed off a hunter. 'There he is! Get him!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks been following the elections in Iran? I know you...have. Anyway, President Ahmadinejad is in a tight race, but today, he got great news for the campaign -- he was endorsed by Mel Gibson.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Listen to this -- listen to how the power of the world is changing. Ahmadinejad may lose his job, and the Korean dictator Kim Jong-Il is stepping down, and before you know it, the only tiny -- because these guys are all petite guys -- the only small control freaks left in the world will be, like, well, Tom Cruise. Is that right?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Listen to this. There was a big storm down in the Washington, DC, area, and it toppled a tree. A giant, ancient tree toppled over. This is how crazy things are. When the tree toppled over, somebody contacted former Vice President Dick Cheney, and he said, 'See, well, there it goes. It proves that President Obama is soft on weather.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But here's what happened. The grounds crew chop it up and then grind it up and use it for mulch. ... And I was thinking, you know, you can do the same thing with your General Motors stock.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is an agency now that keeps track of this kind of stuff, and I think it's fascinating. Do you like the presidential minutia? I love it. I can't get enough of it. And according to this tracking agency, President Obama invokes the name Jesus Christ more frequently now than did George W. Bush for the same amount of time in his Presidency. ... I never really noticed it but I'll bet it's true, because if you think about it, Obama is always saying, 'Jesus! Why did I run for president?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin called David Letterman 'pathetic.' Did you hear? She did. ... She called David Letterman 'pathetic' because of a joke he told. I'm like, David Letterman is my boss. I have got his back, Mrs. Palin, unless you'd won the election. Then Dave would be on his own. But that's show business. That's the way things are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Edward Whitaker, the former chairman of AT&amp;T, was appointed the new chairman of General Motors. I'm not sure about his business plan. He's giving away free cars on nights and weekends. I think that's a bad idea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an interview, the new chairman actually said, 'I don't know anything about cars.' I respect that. He's keeping up the GM tradition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kim Jong-ll said that if provoked, North Korea would not hesitate to use its nuclear weapons in a 'merciless offensive.' Well, I just hope no one is stupid enough to provoke that fat little weirdo. Ooh, women's glasses.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A top Republican is angry that Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor belongs to an elite private group. ... The top Republican's angry, and so is everyone at his country club.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, the controversial Miss California, Carrie Prejean, who famously opposed gay marriage, was stripped of her title. ... Not only that, her chances of becoming Miss San Francisco are really looking slim.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Doctors are testing a new kind of obesity reduction surgery, where they send a tube the size of a garden hose down your throat to staple your stomach. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Recently, Michael Phelps released a children's book he wrote called, 'How to Train with a T. Rex and Win Eight Gold Medals.' Then he wrote another book called, 'How to Make a Bong Out of a Milk Carton.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, everyone is going to be fine, I want to stress that. But earlier today, the NBC medical director sent out an e-mail saying several NBC employees have been diagnosed with the swine flu. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's big news from the world of TV. And I don't know if you guys are ready for this or not. If you have an old TV, tomorrow, it won't work unless you digitalize it. ... You've got to get a converter thing and a lot of people are confused about this. For example, earlier today, John McCain...wanted to know after the...conversion, will his TV dinner still work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You folks been following the Iranian elections? ... Well this guy, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, he's running for re-election. Have you seen this guy?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Boy, here's a story that won't go away. Miss California -- remember Miss California? Got herself in a lot of trouble, shooting her mouth off. Gee, I wonder what that's like.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, now, Miss California's been fired. ... Don't worry. President Obama said he will announce a replacement within a week, so that will be good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it's been a busy week here on the late show. Earlier in the week, I made some jokes that upset Sarah Palin. And I was telling jokes about her family and stuff. She got really upset. And I think everything's fine now. I think everything's going to be great because she called today and...offered to take me hunting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Iran is bracing itself for their upcoming presidential election. ... President Ahmadinejad&quot; is &quot;behind in the polls. I think it's because of his campaign slogan, 'Vote for me, and I won't cut off your hand.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Politics is very similar over there as here. Ahmadinejad says if he's elected, he'll bail out the camel industry.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Karl Rove called Maureen Dowd of the 'New York Times' a 'bitter, twisted, deranged columnist' and a 'dour, downbeat liberal' and -- more -- a 'nasty, snarky person.' Hey, get a room.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congress is considering a bill that would force advertisers to lower the volume of their TV commercials. Okay, how did my mother get in Congress? When did that happen?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is interesting. Researchers have found that people who drive drunk are more dangerous on the road than drivers who are high on marijuana. Don't get too excited. It's mostly because the drivers using marijuana are just sitting in the Taco Bell drive-through.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big science news. A new element will be added to the periodic table. ... It's the heaviest element in the table. It's called ununbium, which is Latin for 'thigh of Rush Limbaugh.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some controversy today surrounding Miss California, Carrie Prejean. She's the one who said she was against same-sex marriage. Some wanted her to be stripped of her title because of it, but Donald Trump, who owns the pageant, said no, she's entitled to her opinion and she'll remain Miss California. Well, today he fired her, which is what he does, I guess. ... My money says she's a Fox News anchor by the -- by now. By right now.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Ahmadinejad is claiming that he won, causing a lot of controversy. Some people say that Ahmadinejad...cheated a little bit. They're now that saying weeks before the election President Ahmadinejad distributed 400,000 tons of potatoes to voters in rural areas. ... Who knew he'd be put over the top by the Iranian-Irish vote?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Joe Biden said something interesting in an interview, just this weekend. Vice President Joe Biden said he still has his eye on the presidency,&quot; which &quot;is weird since the question was, 'How do you take your coffee?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a major speech Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called for the Palestinians to get their own state. ... Unfortunately, the state he offered them is New Jersey.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Questions Messages On Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's Answering Machine:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. What kind of dictator only gets 63% of the vote?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. I voted for you, now where is that goat you promised me?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Dude, where'd you get that sweet tan windbreaker?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. It's Kim Jong-Il. Congratulations. See you at Khaddafi's for Thursday night's Texas Hold'em.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Hey Mahmoud, hey, Mad Dog. Can the Yankees win with that bullpen?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Sorry, wrong number -- I was looking for Maxine Ahmadinejad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. It's Jeb Bush. Those crooked voting machines arrive on time?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Osama here. My cable's out -- can I come over to watch 'Gossip Girl'?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. According to exit polls, soccer moms thought your beard was H-O-T hot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. It's Dubya. Congratulations on winning the election in whatever country you're in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to the 'Late Show.' I'm Dave Letterman, goodwill ambassador. I got a call from Mom earlier today and she told me she was siding with the Governor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Honestly, how many of you are only here tonight hoping that I'll offend somebody else?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's...good news for visitors. Times Square, have you been down to Times Square? It's now -- well, it's now a pedestrian mall. ... They have 400 beach chairs in the...middle of the street. And if you don't get one of those beach chairs, well, I'll lend you a bag of my hate mail. You can relax on that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You folks know about Bernie Madoff? Oh, oh, I mean, most hated man in America. Me, Bernie Madoff. It's right there. It's...kind of a one, two thing. He was way out in front 'til a couple of days ago. But...the 'New York Times' says his wife, Ruth,&quot; is &quot;the loneliest woman in New York City. ... Shunned by friends and neighbors. Well, tell me about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many of you folks are following the elections in Iran? Hard not to. It's compelling. Well, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was re-elected...and won by a landslide, ladies and gentlemen. And I, you know, I guess the voters couldn't resist his good looks and charisma.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But there were problems with the ballots in the Iranian election. And who...would have thought that? There was a mistake. Thousands of Iranians ended up voting for Pat Buchanan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I hope they get this figured out. I hope it goes away soon, because the last thing we need is unrest in the Middle East.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the guy, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, he's very happy that he won. He was up all night shooting nuclear missiles into the air.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then, after the elections, the supreme leader in Iran certified the election results and shipped the crooked voting machines back to Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because earlier, in the Iranian elections, it was a tie. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and the other guy...were tied, and now, couple a days later, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad wins by a landslide. I don't know. People are very upset. ... I mean, they sparked violent protests, calls for investigation, there is national outrage. Uh, wait a minute, that's me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Iran had its presidential election. President Ahma-Dinna-Jacket was way behind in the polls. ... And then, lo and behold,&quot; he &quot;won big, everywhere -- in big cities, rural areas, even in Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Election returns...are kind of hard to believe. According to the numbers, both opposition candidates lost to Ahma-Dinna-Jacket in their hometowns. That's like Barack Obama losing in the city of Chicago. I'm not, in any way, suggesting Iranian politics are as corrupt as Chicago, but even...Blagojevich is like, 'Oh, they're good.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the results from Iran's presidential elections are in. And Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has declared victory. But his opponent, Mir-Hossein Mousavi, is claiming ballot fraud and wants an investigation. If that doesn't work, he's planning on making a documentary about global warming.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of turmoil in Iran right now over the recent presidential election. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Iran has been really cracking down on foreign journalists. So now, they're actually preventing reporters from leaving their hotel rooms. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. 'David who?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. 'Well, it was nice of CBS to provide the catering.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. 'We should have done this years ago.'</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. 'He should apologize for that hairpiece.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. 'Thanks for coming, Regis.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you very much. Welcome to the 'Late Show', ladies and gentlemen. Now, when I call your name, please come forward and pick up your apology.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to get through this as quickly as possible so you folks can get to the 'Fire Dave' rally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's nice that people hate me who are no longer just part of my immediate family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My son, you know, he's telling everybody at school that his father is Conan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, there's a 'Fire Dave' rally going on outside, but I think it's just about over because the last time I looked, they were breaking up and heading to Flashdancers. So I think it's going to be all right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But let's focus on the good news. And the good news is that Sarah Palin has accepted my apology. ... And she also accepted a $500 gift certificate from LensCrafters. I thought that was a nice touch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll tell you, to be honest, I was quite nervous about this whole thing. And I was really nervous about an apology to Sarah Palin. So what I did to get my confidence up, to get my nerves to settle down, I rehearsed by apologizing to Tina Fey. That helped. That was a big help.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trouble here in New York City with Canada geese. And because they pose a threat to...air travel in New York...New York City is now at war with Canada geese. ... And Mayor Bloomberg is serious about this. He is so serious, he's bringing in Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you folks been following the Iranian elections? ... Well how about this Mahmoud Ahmadinejad? You know, he ? he won, he has won the election now. And people are angry, and they're demanding a recount. And as a matter of fact, the last unofficial account actually had Al Franken ahead. They've gone crazy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Iranian government denies that there are crowds of protesters in the street. They're out there, like 100,000 people in the streets of Iran protesting. But the government denies that protests are going on. They say it's just citizens enjoying their new pedestrian mall.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama is closing down that Guantanamo Bay. Did you hear about this? ... And they had, like, 300 desperate, awful, nasty prisoners. And they say, 'All right, well, they're shutting it down, what do you do with those guys?' I say, aw hell, bring 'em to the audience. Let 'em come and enjoy the show. Have a nice time. Participate in the rally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But he's sending some of these people to Bermuda. And the really tough ones, they're...going to Ft. Lauderdale.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He doesn't know what to do with the Guantanamo Bay prisoners, and I was thinking, well, you know, if you want to keep 'em busy, just put 'em in charge of my hate mail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain said on his Twitter feed, on Monday, that he's buying a brand new Ford Fusion Hybrid. A year ago, McCain didn't use a computer. Now he's on Twitter and buying a hybrid. What's going on? I think he's like Benjamin Button. He'll be a cute little baby.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hi, everyone. I'm Jimmy, I'm the host of the show. Before we go any further, I want to just take a minute to apologize for some jokes I'm planning to make about the Palin family tonight. They are in extremely poor taste and I know that I will regret saying them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey I want to be...among the last to offer congratulations to our hometown Los Angeles Lakers. On Sunday, they won the NBA championship. ... There was some vandalism near the Staples Center after the Lakers won. You probably heard about it. Some people even torched vehicles, but they were mostly GM dealers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Barack Obama&quot; has &quot;been on TV more than Regis lately. He was all over NBC the week before last. Next week, he's doing a two-hour, primetime town hall here on ABC. ... But if...we didn't want our President on TV all the time, maybe we shouldn't have elected Oprah's boyfriend.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a crazy story. Fidel Castro, the former Cuban dictator, has a son named Antonio. That's not the crazy part. The crazy part -- for eight months, Antonio Castro carried on an online affair with what he thought was a beautiful Colombian woman. That woman turned out to be a man, a Cuban activist who lives in Miami. And he was pretending to be ? it's especially fun because the Internet is difficult to access in Cuba. To get online in Cuba, you know, you have to give -- I think you have to give five fish to a guy who has ColecoVision hooked up to a 1958 Impala.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The bad economy is affecting the numbers of available jobs. So, many new college graduates are choosing to spend a year volunteering at a nonprofit organization. ... These nonprofit organizations include Chrysler and GM.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama hard at work on the healthcare situation. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Glad you people are here. Because yesterday, we had kind of a thing, and think about this -- this was a little weird. Right here, we're doing the show, right across the street on Broadway, they had the 'Fire Dave' rally going on. Yeah. I mean, it was a gathering of people who actually hate me. Now, at my house, we call that Thanksgiving.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I just...want to say a word of thanks to the great CBS television network. They've been wonderful through everything. ... But yesterday, I thought maybe they were just a little too eager to cash in on this whole thing with the rally. I mean, at the CBS store out on the corner, you know, they were selling highly flammable Dave Letterman effigies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's more big news going on in Iran. You folks been following the Iranian elections? ... Well, here it is. It's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and his opponent, Mir Hossein Mousavi. And they had one of those friendly bets. If Ahmadinejad wins the election, he gets a crate of figs, see. If Mousavi wins the election, he gets brutally slain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So now they're going through the recount. They're recounting the ballots cast in the Iranian election, and today they found 14 more votes for Norm Coleman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's illegal for rallies or demonstrations in Iran. ... But yet you turn on the news, and you see hundreds of thousands of people in the streets protesting, and the government says, 'No, no, no. That's not a public protest. Those are just people lining up to see 'The Hangover.&quot;&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's the breakdown of the Iranian election: 63% of the vote for Ahmadinejad; Mousavi, he's got 34% of the vote; and 3% of the vote goes to Ralph Nader.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You folks know about Guantanamo Bay. ... For years, they've had terrorists and thugs and international criminals and vicious, awful people down there in ...Guantanamo. ... Well, now, Obama says, 'Oh no, that's no good.' But what are you going to do with all of 'em? And I said, 'Well, hell, bring 'em here, put 'em in the audience?' ... 'How bad can it be, I said?' Some nights, it'd be an improvement.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But now, Barack Obama says that four of the Guantanamo prisoners are going to Bermuda. Same thing CBS is trying to do with me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bermuda. That's right. Yeah, they're looking for something to keep them busy. Well, hell, they can answer my hate mail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't kid yourself. You're thinking, Bermuda, tough, really? ... Yes, yes. Let me answer that for you. The prisons in Bermuda are no laughing matter. It's a tough place: no flip-flops in the dining room.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, our old friend John McCain -- and I think we should all follow this man's example -- bought a hybrid car. ... It's not his first hybrid car. His first one was actually a horse and buggy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, it's a hybrid car. I hear this one runs on...gasoline and Metamucil.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're having a lot of trouble over there in Iran. They had the presidential election.

And you know, when you're out in Iran, you're not supposed to be -- public displays, no, you can't do that. And it's like hundreds of thousands of people in the streets now protesting this election. And the government is going crazy. And they're saying, 'No, no, no, no. It's not a -- no, that, that's not a protest. Those are folks just lining up to get their new iPhones.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But this guy, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, I mean, he claims victory and he is very unpopular. ... And the danger politically of this, he could ruin the political career of his brother, Jeb Ahmadinejad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the Iranian supreme leader...will be speaking about the presidential election tomorrow. And if he does well, Al Jazeera will give him the 10:00 p.m. spot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's some wacky news. Last week, Sonia Sotomayor busted up her leg and I guess yesterday Secretary of State Hillary Clinton broke her elbow. ... It's crazy. And I was thinking, what a coincidence. I have a bad elbow myself. I really do. It's from all the drinking I've been doing the last couple of weeks. Hello!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I thought this was nice. When he heard she broke her elbow, Rush Limbaugh sent over some painkillers. So she's going to be fine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But she ? here's what happened. This was sad. Hillary apparently broke her elbow when she slipped and fell bursting into Bill's office unannounced.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's fascinating news. Dick Cheney, do you remember Dick Cheney? Dick 'Boom Boom' Cheney. His approval rating is up to 26%, up to 26%. Yeah, crazy, isn't it? ... He's been upgraded from hated to unpopular.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not surprised that Dick Cheney's approval rating has really soared, really skyrocketed, up to 26%. Because you know, he gave people what they wanted. He left office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not such a great day for Hillary Clinton. She fell down, broke her elbow. ... You know, Fox News is going to be all over this story. This proves the Democrats are weak. Reagan fell over 10 times, didn't even break his hair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now the official report said that Hillary fell while she was walking to her car in the parking lot of the State Department. But Hillary likes to exaggerate, so she's telling everybody it was sniper fire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Secret Service performed beautifully but they had to use the Jaws of Life to cut Hillary out of her pantsuit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In his speech yesterday, former President George W. Bush attacked President Obama's policies on anti-terrorism, healthcare, and the economy. Then Bush spent the next 20 minutes trying to kill a fly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big election news from Iran. A British newspaper reported that Mir Hossein Mousavi actually won the election and Ahmadinejad came in third. And coming in second, Al Gore. ... The guy can't win anything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's some good news. President Obama just appointed Tom Brokaw to his Commission on White House Fellowships, mostly because he loves to hear Brokaw try to pronounce fellowship.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama&quot; is &quot;getting a lot of criticism from PETA, you know, the Psychotics for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. They're taking issue with the fact that he killed a fly. For real. ... PETA said he should have captured the fly and taken it outside, which would have been a great message to send to North Korea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know how flies got on PETA's do not kill list, but they have. And I say let he who is without a stain on his windshield that used to be a moth cast the first stone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House, though, doesn't like confrontation. You know, they like to work things out. So as a gesture of goodwill, they have relocated the fly's family to the Rose Garden, where they are now living on a fresh pile of Bo Obama's dog droppings. So that's nice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you haven't seen the video,&quot; it is &quot;pretty impressive. Reminds me of the time our previous president killed a worm with his tricycle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, is in a cast. She fell and fractured her elbow. Fortunately, her scowl broke the fall, so she is okay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone at the White House is concerned about her, and to wish her well today, they flew a pantsuit at half mast.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some massive protests continued today in Iran. Hundreds of thousands of people swarmed the streets to protest what they believe was election fraud in the re-election of President Mahmoud A Members Only Jacket.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Wednesday night, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton broke her elbow. So, yesterday, she worked from home...which explains why Bill Clinton spent the day in the backyard forming the words 'help me' with garden gnomes.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today the governor of South Carolina, Mark Sanford, who's the head of the Republican Governors Association, held a press conference to reveal he had an affair with a woman from Argentina. ... People were shocked because Republicans traditionally don't do well with Hispanic women.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former Vice President Dick Cheney is in the news. ... Cheney has signed a publishing deal to write his memoirs. ... I don't want to spoil anything, but it ends with him killing Obi-Wan Kenobi.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The 'Transformers' sequel came out today. ... One of the 'Transformers' is a Chevrolet. ... Fortunately, it has a sidekick that transforms into a tow truck.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, two Columbia University students who major in statistics say the Iranian election was rigged because they found there were too many sevens and not enough fives in the vote total. ... Then the students admitted that they have too many free evenings and not enough girlfriends.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Toyota has begun production on a Prius Hearse which they say will be better for the environment than the traditional gas-powered hearse. ... Experts say it's the perfect way to tell everyone at your funeral procession, 'I'm judging you from beyond the grave.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Governor Mark Sanford Excuses: &quot;10. Did I say hiking? I meant cheating. 9. Had to so something after devastating news about Jon and Kate. 8. I learned everything I know from Governor Spitzer. 7. Let's talk about more important issues like the Nestle Toll House cookie recall. 6. I learned everything I know from Governor McGreevey. 5. It's Ahmadinejad's fault. 4. If you met my wife you'd be fleeing the country too, am I right fellas? 3. Putting together my audition tape for 'The Amazing Race'. 2. If you run a state and decide to leave the country for a week, since when do you have to tell someone? 1. It wasn't me, it was my hilarious alter ego, Bruno.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody here from South Carolina? ... Their governor down there, Mark Sanford...disappears. ... He's gone for four days. The first time he said he was hiking the Appalachian Trail. ... Okay, I'm just dumb enough to believe that. Then he says, 'No, no, no, forget the Appalachian Trail. I was in South America.' Now, I'm not sure I'm with him. Today he said he woke up in Las Vegas, hung over with a tiger and a baby.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have to be careful here. I haven't had much luck with jokes about governors, so I have to be careful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But now it turns out that he was in Argentina with another woman. A married guy, got a family, he's in Argentina with another woman. And here's what I want to know -- why can't he be like our former governor and use a local escort service? What's the problem?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know about this Bernie Madoff, the weasel? The guy -- I mean, up to a couple of weeks ago, he was the most hated man in America. And then I had my trouble with the governor of Alaska.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, they're getting ready to sentence the guy...and they're talking about he could go away for quite a long time, and he's now asking the judge for a reduced sentence. Did you know you could do that? I had no idea you could say, 'Well, you know what? I was thinking more in terms of, you know, maybe a weekend now, and a weekend after the holidays.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, Bernie is asking for a sentence of 12 years. ... Nice to see the guy hasn't lost his sense of humor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But in addition...to the sentence, he is also banned from trading securities. And I thought, well, they nipped that in the bud. Way to go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You guys remember Dick Cheney? Vice President for eight years? ... Listen to this -- and by all means try to stay in your seats when you hear the news. Don't be rushing out to bookstores. He's written a memoir about his life. Not just a memoir, a thousand pages! ... It's a great book. You can actually use it to stand on to reach a better book.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This guy doesn't say anything for eight years, and now he's got a thousand-page book? ... Talk about torture. There's your torture right there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, the book...is fantastic, and you better get to Barnes &amp; Noble early for the book shooting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You folks been following what's going on in...Iran? ... Listen to this. They've been going over the voting results, the presidential election, and the president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, received more than 100% of the vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And now, you know, you're not supposed to have any kind of a protest and the government is saying, 'There's no protesting going on. People are not booing. The crowds that you see are not booing. They're just chanting, 'Mahmoud! Mahmoud! Mahmoud!&quot;&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the Iranian supreme leader says the election results are official. He said, 'It's over, the election results are official. And besides that, it costs too much to rig another election.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And...President Obama, this guy takes everything seriously. He's very upset about what's going on in Iran. As a matter of fact, today he announced that he's going to stop smoking Camels.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about Mark Sanford, the governor of South Carolina? ... He mysteriously disappeared last week and nobody knew where he was.&quot; Today, Sanford &quot;admitted to having an affair in Argentina. I'm like, great, now we're outsourcing mistresses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This whole affair is really a sad story. That has to be the worst thing ever done by a guy named Sanford, except for that episode of 'Sanford &amp; Son' where Fred broke Lamont's glass figurine collection.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The past couple of years there have been a whole bunch of scandals involving governors. ... You know things are bad when the most normal governor of the last decade was Jesse 'The Body' Ventura.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mark Sanford, the governor of South Carolina -- this just keeps getting weirder. He was missing for five days. He finally showed up. He claimed that he was just hiking in the Appalachian Mountains. Then just today, he revealed that he was not hiking in the Appalachian Mountains, he was in Argentina the entire time -- in Argentina, where he was having an extramarital affair. Wow! It all seems insane until you realize who his mistress is -- Carmen Sandiego.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On July 14th, everybody, President Obama will throw out the first pitch at the All-Star game in St. Louis. That's pretty cool. Yeah. But Joe Biden will be on hand to commit the first error.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did any of you watch 'Jon &amp; Kate Plus 8' on Monday night? ... They did not stay together, and according to the big ratings they got, there is nothing America loves more than watching a good old-fashioned divorce. ... It's really crazy how much attention this is getting. ... You'd...pretty much have to sneak out of the governor's mansion and spend six days holed up in Argentina with your mistress not to have heard about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about that one? ... The governor of South Carolina ? his name is Mark Sanford ? first he disappeared without telling his staff or his wife where he went. Then...they said he was hiking in the Appalachians. And then today, he showed up in South Carolina and held a press conference to announce that he went to Argentina to visit his mistress, Maria. This is a guy...who some people thought might be a candidate for president next time around. He won't, by the way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Needless to say, this not great news for the Republican Party. So many prominent Republicans have been caught in these types of situations lately: Mark Sanford; Larry Craig; David Vitter; John Ensign from Nevada. And you want to know why this is happening? The gays. That's right. They've destroyed the institution of marriage and now this is what we get.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you're planning a trip to North Korea, don't go. The North Koreans are accusing us of trying to start another war, and they're saying that they will wipe us out if we do. They're probably kidding though, right? They have a good sense of humor about this sort of stuff. I think North Korea would be friendlier to us if we start calling them NoKo.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At a press conference yesterday, in case you don't know, South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford admitted to having a mistress from Argentina. ... Then there was an awkward moment as he waited for someone to give him a high five.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A British furniture company was caught trying to slip advertisements into Twitter by linking them to the Iranian election crisis. ... Probably the most shameless had to be, 'Tired of all the unrest? Try our Serta Perfect Sleeper.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Surprising Facts About Governor Mark Sanford: &quot;10. Began last 'State of the State' address, 'Yo, what's happenin', mama?' 9. Promised his wife he'd be faithful within the 48 contiguous states. 8. On Facebook, lists his relationship status as 'It's complicated.' 7. Becoming disgraced governor ruined his dream of becoming disgraced president. 6. Hoping scandal will get him out of attending in-laws' Fourth of July cookout. 5. Was sick and tired of Eliot Spitzer holding title 'Love Gov'. 4. Often gets fan mail intended for Redd Foxx. 3. His goal in life is to commit adultery on all seven continents. 2. Made it safe for me to joke about Republican governors again. 1. Entered politics because he enjoyed polling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to 'The Late Show.' My name is Dave, or as the governor of South Carolina would say, gracias!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, you know what is going on over in Iran with the election? Have you been following that? Oh, it's crazy. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has declared himself a winner. Had a victory party. And he came out at the victory party and he thanked...the 148% of the people who voted for him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This Ahmadinejad guy, during all those protests, keeping a very low profile in Iran. His staff said he was hiking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama was so upset about the Iranian crackdown...that he told the Iranian diplomats that they would not be invited to the Fourth of July party. ... And I said, well, by God, that will teach them right there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it's a darn shame because Ahmadinejad makes wonderful potato salad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody here from South Carolina? You're here but you don't want to admit it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it's the latest political scandal. Mr. And Mrs. Sanford, you know, the Jon and Kate of politics.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Turned out the governor...disappears, for like, the weekend. ... Finally, his staff said, 'Don't worry about the Governor, he is on the Appalachian Trail hiking.'&quot; But it &quot;turns out he was in South America. And it turned out he was down there because he was...with a woman from Argentina. ... Seeing a woman from Argentina named Maria. ... And I was thinking Judge Sotomayor was apparently wrong because Latina woman don't necessarily have better judgment than white men.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What if there is trouble and you can't find the governor. Well, how does that make you feel? Horrible, doesn't it? And I'm thinking, South Carolina, what if they get the call that North Carolina is invading.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a disaster for everybody down there in South Carolina. Although I have to say, yesterday, it was nice to see somebody else apologize on TV.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But...in this sense, Gov. Sanford is a little like President Obama. He has Friday night date night, it's just not with his wife.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sorry if you were looking for me before the show. I was just hiking the Appalachian Trail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's another new development in that Mark Sanford story. His wife, Jenny, kicked him out of their home when she heard about the affair. In response, Hillary Clinton said, 'Wait, you can do that?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that North Korea? ... Over the weekend, launched seven missiles,&quot; and &quot;Joe Biden, the Vice President, says that they're just trying to get attention. Well, that should calm things down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But...Governor Mark Sanford didn't really enjoy this year's Fourth of July. He left his favorite firecracker in Argentina.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, ladies and gentlemen, here's something very exciting. President Obama is in Russia...although he told his staff he was hiking on the Appalachian Trail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But he's over there. He's talking about getting some major concessions from the Russians. And Russia has agreed -- now, this is surprising -- they agreed now to produce fewer nuclear warheads and more hot tennis babes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is in Russia. And we know this because Sarah Palin says she can see him from her house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was a surprising announcement over the weekend. Governor of Alaska Sarah Palin is leaving the office. She's stepping down. Something I said?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But...a lot of public figures do this. And I've tried to do it. Doesn't work. You blame the media. When you have trouble, you blame the media. And today, as a matter of fact, she was up in a helicopter, shooting Wolf Blitzer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I was talking to a lady here in the audience who's from Alaska. And we were wondering about this. How does a thing like this work? Because she steps down and no longer the governor of Alaska. And we figured it out, the title now is -- Miss Congeniality steps up, I think, -- is now the governor of Alaska. I think so.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, the very big news, you can't avoid it, Sarah Palin's quitting as governor of Alaska. Everybody is shocked. ... Palin hasn't made a decision this controversial since deciding whether to wear her hair up or down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't worry about the state of Alaska. They'll be fine. According to the state constitution, the job automatically goes to the lieutenant governor, Chilly Willy.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's something whacky.&quot; Osama bin Laden's &quot;first wife -- and this guy has literally like 40 wives or something, yeah, 40 wives -- well his first wife, wife number one, is writing a book all about Osama bin Laden. It's a fascinating story. And it talks about when Osama was 16 years old, when he was just a kid, listen to this, he wrecked the family camel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the book is going to be huge. It's being published by Random Cave.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody here from Minnesota? Congratulations on your new senator, Al Franken, finally sworn in as senator of Minnesota. Sworn in today, down in Washington. ... A lovely ceremony, officiated by the Church Lady.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They swear him in today. Listen to this. He has to race right back to Minnesota to begin his re-election campaign. It's crazy.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it's an important trip for Obama to go to Russia. He's gotten a lot of concessions. He has now gotten the Russians to agree to decrease production of nuclear warheads. Well that's not bad right there. ... And, that's not all. They're going to increase production of fruit-flavored vodka.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it's not all fun and games for President Obama over there in Russia. He has a busy agenda. Today, he visited the birthplace of Yakov Smirnoff.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now how about this, ladies and gentlemen? The governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin, has announced she is stepping down. She will no longer be the governor of Alaska.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And people are puzzled by this. They say, 'Well Governor, Sarah, what are you going to do? What's going to happen?' And insiders believe that she hopes to be the next 'Octomom.' But I don't know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But she's going to take the summer off, and then will come back next fall in the 10 o'clock slot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She said that before she decided to quit, she called Dick Cheney. ... Do you remember Dick 'Ka-boom' Cheney? ... And I thought, well, this is great because when you want some advice on strategic maneuvers, I mean, you go to the architect of the Iraqi war. I mean, isn't that where you go? That's where you want to be.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But friends of Governor Palin are saying that she is resigning because she is tired of attacks from the media. ... Thank God I didn't say anything.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't want to hurt anybody's feelings,&quot; but in &quot;this...country, people are getting fatter. ... But now, to add insult to injury, or injury to insult, they have isolated the fattest state in the United States. Yup. Mississippi. And I thought, well this is no surprise. You know the state motto of Mississippi? Right there on the flag, it says, 'Are you gonna finish that?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know anything about -- we had a guy in town, he's gone away to jail now for 150 years -- Bernie Madoff? And now the US government&quot; has &quot;started...trying to find out&quot; about his wife, who &quot;had, like, $87 million. And she kept saying, 'Now this is not money that Bernie swiped. This is not -- this is not money that he swindled. This is not swindling money. You see, this is money I saved by switching to GEICO.' They said, 'What?! That's ? how is that possible, lady?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So they took all of that money and she's down to $2.5 million. ... But I was thinking, you know, with that...and her Social Security and the $10 billion she has hidden in the Cayman Islands, well, she should be all right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Ruth Madoff says she had no idea what Bernie was up to. And I thought, well, what a coincidence, neither did the SEC.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Ruth -- listen to this -- Ruth lost her house. Ruth lost her house, lost her car; has lost her savings. I mean, I'm telling you, it's like being a Bernie Madoff client.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You folks worried about North Korea? ... Everybody is getting paranoid about North -- I took Mom to see the fireworks and every time they set off a big one, she'd scream, 'It's North Korea!'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's frightening times, when you think about it, with all these dictators. And they are all smallish. They're all on the small side. Kim Jong Il, tiny guy. Iran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, tiny guy. Mayor Bloomberg, tiny guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But anyway, over the weekend, North Korea test fired several missiles. And it was their way of saying, 'Iran's not the craziest country, we are the craziest country, so get ready.'&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor got under way. ... And, of course, people have opinions on both sides. Critics of Judge Sotomayor claim that she has a bias against white people.&quot; But &quot;this morning, she proved them wrong by showing up at the hearings wearing a Coldplay t-shirt and carrying a yoga mat.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People in New York are especially excited by Judge Sotomayor because she comes from the Bronx. ... In fact, Judge Sotomayor famously presided over the landmark New York City case, Shut Up vs No, You Shut Up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama has another nominee in the news. That's right. President Obama's&quot; nominee &quot;for surgeon general is a doctor who practices in rural Alabama and still makes house calls. Can you believe that? ... Of course, in Alabama, a house call is when the patients drive their house to you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US government has issued a warning to builders not to use a Chinese drywall because they say it's defective. ... The Chinese government denied this and said, 'Hey, if there's one thing we know how to build, it's a wall.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;California lawmakers still trying to close the state's massive budget deficit, so they're now talking about saving money by consolidating all the state agencies into different groups. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Dick Cheney Excuses:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. Was going to make it public, but then I remembered I'm an evil bastard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. It was so secret, I didn't even tell myself about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Uh oh, chest pains -- gotta go!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Wasn't me -- I was judging a water ski exhibition in Orlando.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Hellooo -- everything I do is illegal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Spy program? I thought it was a pie program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. No habla Ingles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. I can't willfully violate the Constitution and the rights of every American citizen -- what is this, Russia?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Dude, bros before hos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. If I announced every evil thing I did, I wouldn't have time to shoot old guys in the face.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hot today in New York City. ... So hot today that Sarah Palin had to wear sunblock for her rambling press conference.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a new Osama bin Laden tape. ... And people say, 'Well, is it a new tape?' Yes. They verified it, it's a new audiotape because in it, he says he doesn't think that 'Bruno' is as funny as 'Borat.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They began the confirmation hearings down in Washington for a new Supreme Court justice, Sonia Sotomayor. Anybody see it? Something always goes haywire. The hearings for the confirmation were delayed...until security could quiet down all of the Chuck Schumer groupies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Sonia Sotomayor is in for a couple hours of...intense grueling, you know, like me when I get home late.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But if you're interested in the confirmation hearings, you can watch them live on C-SPAN Dos.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Beautiful weather here in New York City. Sunny, beautiful, sunny, clear day. It was so bright and sunny, you could even see what Dick Cheney was up to.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So now it turns out that Dick Cheney, while he was Vice President, had a...private deal going with the CIA. And he goes to the CIA -- and those guys are pretty good at keeping a secret -- and he goes to the CIA, and he says, 'Boys, this will just be between you and me. We're going to run our own antiterrorism program. You and me. Don't tell Congress.' Eight years this was going on. And when I heard this, I said to myself, 'Gosh, that doesn't sound like the Dick Cheney I know.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They tried to get a hold of Cheney for comment, but his staff said, 'No, no, you can't talk to Cheney. He's taking a hike on the Appalachian Trail.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Very secret operation, went on for eight years. Nobody knew anything about it. The only thing they knew was that it was called 'Operation Hunting Accident.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama&quot; is &quot;going to be working in the broadcast booth during the All-Star Game. Everybody says, 'Oh, that's cute.' But let me tell you something. You know the economy is bad when the President has to take a second gig.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin...said when she leaves the governor's office at the end of the month, she's open to campaigning for some Democrats. Well, that's great news for Republicans.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see this, yesterday in Washington? President Obama was in the middle of giving a speech when his teleprompter fell to the floor and shattered. ... Meanwhile, Joe Biden's teleprompter has been treated for exhaustion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, Sonia Sotomayor's confirmation hearings are under way. ... It's interesting. Political experts say that if Republican senators attack Sonia Sotomayor too harshly, they could alienate Latino members of their own party. ... This may explain with Republicans opened every question with, 'As a huge fan of Santana.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More details are coming out about Judge Sotomayor. Apparently, she's a big New York Yankee fan. ... This is good news for the Yankees because they really need a strong lefty off the bench.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, former President Bill Clinton said he supports gay marriage. ... However, Clinton still remains very much strongly opposed to straight marriage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of former presidents, yesterday, former President George W. Bush released the final list of all the guests who stayed overnight at the White House when he was president. ... The most frequent visitor was someone known as 'The Wiggles.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Signs Sonia Sotomayor Is Getting Cocky:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. Addressed senators with 'Whaddaya say, meat?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Spent the entire hearing updating her Twitter page.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Interrupted questioning to get fitted for her robe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Turned surprisingly hostile when told, 'No open containers.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Left early to tackle the case of Sotomayor vs. Applebee's riblets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Started hitting on Clarence Thomas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Kept referring to Al Franken as 'Church Lady.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Phoned in from All-Star Game in St. Louis to see how the confirmation hearings were going.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Only answers she gave were, 'Maybe,' and, 'How the hell should I know?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Took the day off to go salmon fishing with Sarah Palin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You remember Dick Cheney, who was the Vice President for eight years with George W. Bush? And we didn't think much about Dick Cheney...and then one day he goes hunting, boy, that changed everything. Well now it turns out that for eight years, Dick Cheney...had a secret hit squad to assassinate al Qaeda leaders. ... And the team was unbelievable. Here's who was on the team: Lee Marvin; Jim Brown; John Cassavetes; Telly Savales; and Trini Lopez as Pedro.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the secret assassination squad, tough group of guys. To make the team, you had to survive a hunting trip with Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now here is the thing. Here are the two sides of this. The ying and the yang. Idea was we'd kill off al Qaeda leaders. That's the ying, I guess. The yang is completely illegal. But, listen to this. Before you make your judgment, before you decide, if it weren't for Dick Cheney and his secret assassination squad, Osama bin Laden would be alive today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, you know, there's a brand new audio tape from Osama bin Laden. You know what the guy does, like, every couple of months, he'll shoot out a new audio tape. It's just to irritate people and get them all worked up and stuff. Should really be stopped. But in the new tape, they know it's current because he talks about his ex-wife's new book that she's written about him. In the new tape, he says, 'Yeah, well, let me tell you something. If you'd be married to her, you'd be drunk all the time, too. You try living in a cave with that woman!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Are you watching the Sonia Sotomayor confirmation hearings for the Supreme Court? Are you watching those? Day two. Fascinating stuff. And, man, did you see it this morning? Had the place going crazy. She shows up and right off the bat, she opens up with 'I Dreamed a Dream'. Wow!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Then this was odd. Kind of awkward. When everybody calmed down, Clarence Thomas sent over a mojito.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This happened yesterday at the White House. President Obama was talking to a bunch of people and he's using a teleprompter, tells him exactly what to say, they got the teleprompter, the things rolling by like that. All of a sudden, it overheats and explodes and crashes to the ground. The teleprompter. I read that, I said, 'Boy, I'm disappointed in this guy. What kind of a guy can't think and speak on his -- flip the card for me -- on his feet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I mean, you probably know what a teleprompter is, the machine that tells you what to say. In Bush's case, it was Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama...attended the All-Star Game in St. Louis tonight. ... He was there to give a...bailout to whoever was losing in the 9th inning. That was nice of him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess everyone is following Sonia Sotomayor's Supreme Court confirmation hearing. Did you hear what happened yesterday? Her twin nephews fell asleep during the hearings. But in their defense, they were watching a Supreme Court confirmation hearing. What are you supposed to do? Root for it? Start the wave?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin's friends say they are worried about her because she looks frail and her hair is thinning. It's all part of her plan to run for president in 2012 as John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Democrats want an investigation into a secret CIA program that was concealed from Congress by Dick Cheney. The program is so secret, Cheney could tell you about it, but then he'd have to take you hunting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama's teleprompter fell to the ground and shattered yesterday during a speech on the economy. Wow, even speeches about the economy are crashing. That's bad. That's not good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Lauren Conrad -- star of The Hills' -- she topped the children's 'New York Times' bestseller list with her book 'L.A. Candy.' As a result, the Department of Education has launched a new program telling kids not to read.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama's Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor...had her second day in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee today. I guess they have to do that in order to be confirmed to the Supreme Court. Her confirmation is pretty much a forgone conclusion, but even the leading Republican said the only way she would not be confirmed is if she had a meltdown, in which case she'd be named the governor of Alaska.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Democrats in the House introduced a 1,000-page national healthcare plan. ... To make sure at least some people read it, they named it 'Harry Potter and the Half-Pound Proposal.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nine survivors of shark attacks recently went to Washington, DC, to press the Senate to put new restrictions on shark fishing. ... The Senate met with the leader of the group, Torso Jones.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is weird. In a recent interview, Levi Johnston said that Sarah Palin could never handle the responsibility of being president. ... Then he said, 'Oh, hell, where did I leave that baby?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you been watching the confirmation hearings going on down there in Washington, DC? Sonia Sotomayor, the hearings, have you been watching those? Good news, the FDA has just approved a new, non-drowsy version of Senator Orrin Hatch. Boy, do we need it now!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks see the All-Star Game last night, the baseball All-Star Game? Whew! I thought this was exciting. President Obama threw out the first pitch. Did you see that? Because they were playing in St. Louis at a National League park, he also had to bat. Were you aware of that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But he admitted today that after throwing out the first pitch, his arm was a little sore. And today, Rush Limbaugh offered him some OxyContin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought it was fascinating how the New York papers covered the All-Star Game and Obama throwing out the first pitch.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that Harry Potter movie? Opened today as a matter of fact. ... In this one, Harry goes up against Dick Cheney and his secret CIA hit squad.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This weekend is the 10th anniversary of 'SpongeBob SquarePants.' ... President Obama recently said SpongeBob is his favorite cartoon.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama threw out the first pitch at the baseball All-Star Game last night. And I know the President is busy, but he really needs a personal shopper.

He claims it would raise almost $1.5 billion a year for the state in taxes, and...another $3 billion in Cheeto sales.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's kind of a silly thing. Remember the All-Star Game last week, President Obama throws out the first pitch and everything seemed to be fine. Then later, people started to criticize what he was wearing. ... They said he's wearing, and I never heard this expression, 'baggie dad jeans.' ... And Obama was surprised by the whole thing.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're learning more and more about Obama's healthcare plan, and if it passes, the healthcare plan, if that passes, President Obama will have the governor of South Carolina neutered. Did you realize that?&quot;</SPAN></P>

I don't know if Dr. Benjamin's weight should be an issue, but her food pyramid does call for three to five daily servings of McRibs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama held another press conference tonight, preempting all the major networks again. He does this every week now. It's time for Oprah to give him a show.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the White House actually -- this is true -- rescheduled the President. They moved it up an hour from 9:00 to 8:00 because NBC complained it would interfere with 'America's Got Talent'. So in other words, the President of the United States moved his press conference to accommodate a show David Hasselhoff is on. I think Clinton did that for 'Baywatch' once.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The focus was on the national healthcare plan that is working through Congress. He needed to made a strong case tonight -- 50% are in favor of the universal healthcare and the other 50% have coverage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Republicans had been running a surprisingly effective campaign against the proposal for national healthcare, but the President found a very clever way to get them on board. Behind the scenes, he offered a key provision that would provide free breast implants for their girlfriends.&quot;</SPAN></P>

And, you know, it's interesting -- political experts are now saying that President Obama is giving so many interviews and appearing on so many television shows that he's starting to dilute his own message...which I think is unfair because I thought Obama was pretty convincing last night on 'Ice Road Truckers.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, last night, President Obama gave his healthcare speech. ... It drew almost 20 million viewers. Twenty million viewers! That's a lot these days. Yeah, these days, the only way you can get 20 million people to tune into the show is to beat Spencer Pratt&quot; from MTV's &quot;The Hills&quot; &quot;to death with a naked Megan Fox,&quot; the &quot;Transformers&quot; actress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;War of words now...between Hillary Clinton and North Korea. Getting nasty. Earlier this week, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that North Koreans were acting like children. Yesterday, a spokesman for North Korea said Hillary Clinton was acting like a schoolgirl. Now, folks, is it me or is it obvious these two like each other?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Surprises In The President Obama News Conference:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. Began with a moment of silence for the Taco Bell Chihuahua.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Vice President Biden stepped up to the podium pleading for 'hair plug reform.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Put on Kiss makeup and sang 'Dr. Love'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. MSNBC reporter tried to hug him so Obama went after him with a fire extinguisher. [Editor's note: During the reading of surprise seven, CBS showed old footage of Letterman going after fitness celebrity Richard Simmons with a fire extinguisher.]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Wore his skinny jeans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. His ten minute infomercial for the Slap Chop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Claimed he's borrowing $1 trillion from Regis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Told everyone to watch 'Men and Their Vegetables,' Friday on the 'Late Show'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In one hour, he went through two packs of Camels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Said he's resigning to run for governor of Alaska.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is historic, this is huge in the world of politics. I don't know if you remember a couple of years ago we had that presidential election. And John McCain was running. And he needed a date for the ticket. So he...got a hold of the governor of Alaska. And they ran. They didn't win but they ran. And now the governor of Alaska decided that she's quitting. So...on Sunday, she's leaving office. And she will officially hand over her sash and her crown to her successor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know, there's some kind of ethics investigation going on up in Alaska, also involving Governor Palin. I don't know what the ethics violations are, but for our purposes here, let's just say that she robbed a gas station.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She's stepping down as governor. Leaving the governor's mansion. Next stop, LensCrafters commercial.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't kid yourself. Sunday is going to be an emotional day. It's her last day. She's going to go out on to the porch and wave goodbye to Russia. So it's a big weekend.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's news from Pakistan. ... They believe now, intelligence believes, that a US missile attack about six months ago killed one of Osama bin Laden's sons. ... And the CIA believes that it was the hot-tempered Sonny.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Osama's favorite son, of course, was Osama W. bin Laden. He was -- no, he wasn't too bright.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a woman in Florida, and they arrested her. And she's in her garage. And...you know what she is doing in her garage? She's pretending she's a dentist. ... And she's making dentures and she has the reclining chair and the drilling equipment and, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Obama health plan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody see President Obama's press conference last night on television about the health plan? Here's the deal -- it will cost a trillion dollars...but that will be in three easy payments of $330 billion a month, so it's not that bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But you know...who really is opposed to the Obama healthcare plan? The Republicans. ...Apparently it does not cover breast implants for their mistresses so they think, 'We don't want it. We don't need it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Finally some good economic news today. Ford announced they made a profit $2.3 billion over the last three months. I think it's because people responded to their new slogan, 'Ford, we're not General Motors.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you watch President Obama's press conference last night? Well, boring. Let me tell you. I know he's our president so I shouldn't say this, but if he loves this healthcare proposal so much, why doesn't he marry it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama tried to get a fire going under the lawmakers before the August recess, which is when they take a one-month break in order to visit their girlfriends in South America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the chances of getting a vote on the bill done by August doesn't look good. Right now, it's being held up in the Senate by a group of conservative-leaning Democrats called Blue Dogs. I never heard of this. They're called blue because they're from blue states and dogs because they roll over for the healthcare lobby. And also, they eat their own poop.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;North Korea today launched another attack, but this one of a personal nature against our secretary of state, Hillary Clinton. You've got to love North Korea. They're a great villain. They say crazy things, their leader looks like Ethel Merman, all their missiles are named Dong; they're the best.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is big news. Yesterday, Chicago White Sox, pitcher Mark Buehrle threw a perfect game. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of President Obama, today, President Obama spoke to the Massachusetts police officer who arrested the black Harvard professor, Henry Louis Gates Jr. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Things Overheard At Sarah Palin's Farewell Party:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. 'More tiny hot dog appetizers? You betcha.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. 'Don't forget to schedule an appointment with Joe the Mover.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. 'Quiet down! We don't want to wake the Russians.'</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. 'Where can I check my pelt?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. 'Bad news -- the new governor just quit.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. 'Please accept this gift from all of us at LensCrafters.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. &quot;Dancing with the Stars' called, they got your resume.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. 'I haven't seen you since the 'Fire Dave Letterman' rally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In prison now, Bernie Madoff is making 14 cents a day sweeping floors. ... Now hold it, I know, I know what you're saying, but seriously, that's not as much as it sounds because 8 cents of that goes to Obama's new healthcare plan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A big gun manufacturer is making shotgun with a cup holder.... You remember when this country used to invent light bulbs and televisions and computers? No, now we got a shotgun with a cup holder. They're calling it 'The Dick Cheney.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the great things, and I never, it never dawned on me -- this is why I'm not an inventor, why I'm not making a billion dollars -- the shotgun with the cup holder, it's fantastic because, think about the recoil. The shotgun puts a wonderful head on your beer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, by the way ladies and gentlemen, governor of Alaska will be stepping down in two days, Sarah Palin, stepping down, two days. Unless, of course, she decides to leave early.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Governor Palin says she is leaving office because she wants to spend more time hunting down her escaped son-in-law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It hasn't been a good week for Hillary Clinton. The North Korean government lashed out at her, saying she looks like a schoolgirl. ... Bill Clinton responded with, 'I wish.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you guys watch 'Nightline' last night? President Obama said that since becoming President, he's gone from praying before bed to praying all the time. And it's always the same prayer: 'God, please don't let Joe Biden say something stupid today. Please.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The ratings for President Obama's press conference Wednesday night were down 14% from his last one. So, to try to boost ratings for his next press conference, they're having his cousin Oliver move into the White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And finally, this August, President Obama's renting a vacation home on Martha's Vineyard. It's amazing. It has a basketball court, swimming pool, apple orchard, and a driving range. The President says he can't wait to shoot hoops while Michelle is looking forward to pulling apple trees out of the ground with her bare hands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, maybe you heard about this. It's been in the news a lot lately, more than you might expect, actually. Apparently, there is a group of Americans who do not believe that Barack Obama was born in the United States and therefore should not be president. They're called birthers. They are. The birthers want Obama's election to be invalidated, which, I'm not sure what their goal is. Are they aware that Joe Biden would be the President?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The birthers...believe that the President was secretly born in Kenya, not in Hawaii. I always thought he was born in a manger in Jerusalem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Kenya makes no sense. Listen, if Barack Obama had been born in Kenya, don't you think Madonna would have adopted him by now?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They actually make a very convincing case. As far as we know, the only evidence that President Obama was born in Honolulu, where he claims he was born, is his word. And this birth certificate, that says Barack Hussein Obama II was born in Honolulu on this date, August 4, 1961, Obama's birthday, with this raised seal from the state of Hawaii, and this signature from the Hawaii state registrar and confirmation from the current director of the Hawaii Department of Health that the certificate is legitimate, plus this birth notice in a Hawaii newspaper from 1962, and this birth notice from a different Hawaii newspaper on the same day. But other than that, there is no evidence that Barack Obama was born in the United States. For all we know, the guy could be from the moon. Oh, and, they have this picture of baby Obama being delivered by Don Ho, but other than that...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, after reading through all these websites, I'm no longer convinced that I was born in the United States of America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President is busy trying to get his healthcare plan through Congress. I thought this was interesting. Obama pointed out that most other Western countries pay about half what we do for healthcare and get the same or even better outcomes, though opponents of the plan point out that people in those countries sometimes have to wait in line for care, which Americans...would never accept. Here, we only wait in line for stuff that's important, like iPhones and Grand Theft Auto 4.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And big news up in Alaska. Sarah Palin will formally step down as governor on Sunday, leaving us completely unprotected from the Russians.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Palin announced her retirement a couple of weeks ago without exactly saying why. Ordinarily when you quit a job like this, you give a reason like 'I was just caught in a restroom soliciting gay sex,' or 'I was just caught banging a thousand dollar hooker,' or 'I was just caught sneaking to Argentina to have sex with my girlfriend,' -- oh, wait, that guy actually didn't resign, but you get the idea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Her decision to resign has resulted in an 18-point drop in her approval rating among Americans, and a 52-point drop among terrified moose.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin resigned yesterday, and during her speech, she was heckled. ... Apparently, it was just someone in Russia yelling, 'Keep it down over there!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In her final speech as governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin compared herself to a grizzly bear. ... Her exact words were, 'I have the public speaking ability of a grizzly bear.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To ease tensions, President Obama has invited Harvard Professor Henry Louis Gates and the police officer who arrested him to join him for a beer at the White House. ... And if that works out, Obama's going to have Ahmadinejad and Netanyahu over for J?gerbombs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is hosting a delegation of 150 Chinese officials in Washington. ... Among the questions the Chinese have for the US: 'What's your military policy? What is your stance on global warming? And where's our money?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Critics of the Federal stimulus plan say that millions of dollars are being wasted on fixing up bathrooms at our national parks. ... They may be right, because, this week, they turned Old Faithful into a bidet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, now here is the big fun over the weekend. Sarah Palin, governor of Alaska, stepped down. ... It was a moving day for Sarah Palin. She went out on her porch and waved goodbye to Russia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People say, 'Well, what will the Governor do now?' And I'll tell you. She's going back to her old job as perfume spritzer at Nordstrom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah said goodbye, but she's coming back in the fall in the 10:00 slot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I thought her remarks were very thoughtful. In her farewell address, she warned people...of the military-industrial complex. Sarah Palin says look out for the military-industrial complex. And she also reminded folks that doughnuts make you hippy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I thought this was only to be expected. Sarah Palin took a swipe at certain people in the media. Gosh, I wonder who she had in mind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now here's the way President Obama likes to do stuff. They had this problem up there at Harvard and the professor, Professor Gates and the cop, the professor, the Officer Crowley, and the professor officer -- so there was big trouble. So President Obama says, 'Why don't you guys? Here's what we'll do. Come to the White House. You guys, we'll settle our differences. We'll have a beer. We'll have a beer.' And if it works for those guys...he's going to try it with Jon and Kate,&quot; and he is &quot;going it to try it with the Israelis and Hamas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big beer fest at the White House. And today, Obama sent Vice President Biden on an emergency goodwill mission for pretzels, so that will be good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But here it is. You have Crowley and you have Gates. And tempers flared. Case of mistaken identity. You have anger. You have accusations. You have name-calling. Sure, let's add alcohol! Let's go, let's pick it up! Why not?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what they're saying, that President Obama is trying to do too much too soon. You have heard that criticism? They criticized him for trying to do too much too soon and the fact that he wears baggie jeans. No wonder his poll numbers are going down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it's too much too soon. Just kind of the opposite of President Bush, too little too late.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US Senate is considering a bill that would tax Botox. ... When Botox users heard this, they were horrified. Well, I think they were horrified. It's difficult to tell.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, the President of France fainted while jogging. First of all, what kind of president of France is jogging? He should be smoking!&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's all right now. But for a couple of minutes, he was so woozy he mistook his wife for his mistress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Sarah Palin gave her last speech before resigning as governor of Alaska. It was a very fiery speech. She was mad. I mean, she blasted the media, Hollywood, two bears, and a moose.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, said that Twitter is now blocked on every White House computer. Gibbs said, 'Sorry, I will not give a specific reason on why we are blocking Twitter. This concerns international White House ? okay, it was Biden. He was playing around again.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you guys heard about this? Henry Louis Gates, the Harvard professor who was arrested while trying to get into his own house? Well, to smooth things over, President Obama has invited Gates and the cop, Sergeant Crowley, to the White House for a beer. How cool is that? Obama is handling the situation like two of his bros got in a fight over a girl or something. They'll come over. One beer will lead to two. Two will lead to nine. Next thing you know, everyone will forget they were ever mad at each other. They'll start doing J?ger shots out of Betsy Ross' thimble. They'll make prank phone calls on the Red Phone. ... Crowley will pass out. They'll put his hand in warm water and giggle. Then they'll all wake up in the morning with matching...tattoos&quot; of &quot;Twilight&quot; star &quot;Robert Pattinson. ... It's such a great idea.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin resigned the other day, and in her final speech -- I don't know if you listened to it -- she compared herself to a grizzly bear who will defend its cubs wherever the road may lead. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama, of course, everyone knows, has invited Harvard Professor Henry Louis Gates and the police officer who arrested him to the White House for a beer. ... Of course, this could be trouble, because the last time Obama got a few beers in him, he bought General Motors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama held a Q &amp; A session about healthcare reform with senior citizens over the Internet. ... Unfortunately, the senior citizens spent the entire hour typing questions into their microwave ovens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Members of the Senate are considering a tax on cosmetic surgery. When they brought it up, you should have seen the look that Nancy Pelosi's face tried to make.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to the show, ladies and gentlemen. I'm so happy you're here tonight, because, last night, oh my gosh, we had a rough crowd. ... I couldn't get the Blue Dogs to go along. Oh, you see, I didn't know what that meant either.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know about the situation? Professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr., from Harvard and Sergeant James Crowley, the police officer that cuffed him and tried to drag him out of his house and arrest him. Then later, in a press conference, President Obama said that one of them, I guess the policeman, acted stupidly. Already, there's trouble right there. So here's what the President is going to do. Does it make sense? I don't know. He invited the professor and the cop to come to the White House on Thursday for beer. Alcohol usually cools things off. Have you noticed that? That's where you want to go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Joe Biden's pretty busy. Today he went out to get a keg.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But everybody at the White House, excited about the kegger. You know who's coming? ... Well, Dick Cheney will be there. Here's what he's going to do. He'll be playing the organ down in his old dungeon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If it goes well, then President Obama is going to invite Governor and Mrs. Sanford to come up and have a beer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then in the spirit of this, I thought it was nice today, Rush Limbaugh called up Professor Gates and Officer Crowley and he invited them over for some OxyContin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama's not the only President who enjoys the occasional beer. Bill Clinton, remember Bill Clinton would have an occasional beer? Here's what he would do. He would go into a bar and order a cold one. Do you remember that? And then the bartender would say, 'Oh, then go home to Hillary.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama invited Harvard Professor Henry Lewis Gates and Sergeant James Crowley to the White House for a beer this Thursday. It's all part of Obama's new approach to diplomacy, 'How would they handle this on 'Cheers.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Who watched the season finale of 'The Bachelorette' last night? .... It came down to a choice between computer consultant Ed and in a surprise twist, South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford, who gets around.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday at the White House, President Obama took part in an online Q &amp; A session with a group of senior citizens. ... The most common question the seniors asked Obama was, 'What have you done with Eisenhower?'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, of course, on Fox News...commentator Glenn Beck said that he believes President Obama is a racist. ... Well, to be fair, every time you watch Glenn Beck, it does get a little easier to hate white people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, President Obama has invited Harvard Professor Henry Louis Gates and the policeman who arrested him to the White House. Reportedly, Obama is going to serve them Budweiser. ... And in the spirit of racial harmony, Budweiser is changing its nickname from the 'King of Beers' to the 'Martin Luther King of Beers.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big kegger at the White House tomorrow. ... Professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. will be there and Sergeant James Crowley will be there, coming over for beer. It's going to be a crazy night. There will be karaoke with Tim Geithner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe it's the first White House kegger, really, since the Bush twins lived there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know who else is going to be there? Dick Cheney, former Vice President Dick 'Kaboom' Cheney will be there. He's going to go down to his old dudgeon and play the organ.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone's in kegger spirits. And how can you not be? Hillary Clinton, by the way, is in kegger spirit. She's going to be serving snacks in a skimpy pantsuit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They were talking to Hillary about it and she is still interested in running for president. She said running for president is not on her radar, not on her radar. Yeah, but she's still got Bill on LoJack.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former Governor Sarah Palin, she's rumored to be interested in a new career as a talk radio host. It's a four-hour show but she'll be gone after two. So, that's -- she says it's part of her deal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, you have to remember, radio host is now the most powerful position in the Republican Party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'The Morning Drive' on WQU-Betcha.' Should be exciting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Finally, tomorrow, President Obama has his big beer summit with Professor Henry Louis Gates and Sergeant James Crowley. Yeah, that's a great idea. In my experience, the best way to settle an argument between guys from Boston, just add alcohol.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They had the big beer summit earlier tonight at the White House. President Obama had a beer with Harvard Professor Henry Louis Gates and the policeman who arrested him. ... The meeting got off to a rough start when a neighbor called the police to say Gates was breaking into the White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Conservatives are criticizing &quot;Time' magazine because they put President Obama on the cover for the 12th time in the last year. ... Not only that, every week since Obama was elected, he's been on the cover of 'Black President Magazine.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is true, though. This is Obama's 12th appearance on the cover of 'Time' magazine. And this beats President Bush's record of 11 appearances on the cover of 'Mad' magazine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The schedule for next year's Iowa caucuses has been announced. And Jewish voters are upset because the caucus is being held on Saturday, which means they can't attend. ... This could reduce the number of voters in the Iowa caucus by almost two.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, Fox commenter Glenn Beck said that President Obama 'has a deep-seated hatred for white people and white culture.' Very controversial. ... In the President's defense, the White House cited the time Obama had John Tesh over to play Scattergories.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier this week -- this is weird, I just found out about this -- Shaquille O'Neal stopped by the White House unannounced to see President Obama, but a Secret Service agent turned him away. That really happened. The agent told Shaq to make an appointment and to someday make a free throw.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Interesting announcement just came out. Next month, a 95-year-old Crow Indian chief will receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom. ... When asked about it, the chief said, 'Great, that should pretty much make up for everything.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Things Overheard At The White House Beer Summit:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. 'Don't worry. Biden will clean up the empties.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. 'Guys, stop me if I try to drunk dial Nancy Pelosi.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. 'Smoking, drinking. Suddenly our President is Artie Lange.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. 'Let's call Limbaugh and take this party to the next level.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. 'I feel dizzy and confused -- just like Bush! Hi-yo!'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. 'I don't want to freak anybody out, but I just saw Nixon walking down the hall.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. 'Tell Geithner to put his shirt on.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. 'Senator Larry Craig asked if he could have his beer brought to the men's room.' (Still a reference, people).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. 'You guys wanna see where Clinton used to get freaky?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. 'Excuse me while I take a presidential leak.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama is always talking about healthcare and you got the big healthcare bill and is it going to pass? And nobody knows and everybody is upset about it. We're worried about healthcare. I myself am concerned about healthcare because all week long I have been sick. ... I go to the doctor and tell him what my symptoms are. And he is conducting an examination and he...says, 'I am sorry, Mr. Dave, I have no tongue depressor. Do you mind if I use my pocket comb?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin announced she's leaving as governor of Alaska and everybody said...'Well, what is she going to do?' ...She wants to host a radio show, like a daily talk show. And of course, with that, she's going to have to tell people when she's winking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's right, another ranting radio host. Cut me a slice of that, will you? Let's go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, today -- I'm so excited about this, and I think we all are -- the big kegger down in Washington at the White House. The big beer party. They're having the big beer party to celebrate the last day of finals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's who's going to be there -- Harvard Professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. and Sergeant James Crowley, meeting with Barack Obama over beers. And I understand we had a spy down there looking in. It went so well that Vice President Biden had to go out twice for ice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wonder if somebody like Bush had invited Saddam Hussein over to the White House, if we could have just settled that whole thing without all the bloodshed and violence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Obama really cut loose at the kegger. He...was wearing baggy dad jeans and sipping a Bud Lite.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Things really went nuts at the kegger and about 8:00, everybody was a little tipsy, and they drunk dialed Ben Bernanke.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then things got completely out of hand and everybody took a leak in the Rose Garden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody in Washington, DC, helped out to make the big kegger quite a success. And I thought this was...nice. To show that there are no hard feelings anywhere, toward the end of the evening, Bill Clinton, former President Bill Clinton, that Bill Clinton, brought over a stripper.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama held his first beer summit at the White House today. Obama wanted Bud Light, Crowley wanted Blue Moon, Gates wanted a Red Stripe, and Joe Biden wanted whatever fits in his beer helmet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The beer summit was good. But we all know that the best stuff goes down at the after summit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama wants to make this a regular thing. He's already invited Ahmadinejad over for Appletinis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Vice President, Joe Biden held a series of closed door meetings. Not because they were secret. He just couldn't figure out how to open the door.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pardon me if I slur a little tonight. I have been at the White House, doing beer bongs with the President.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, President Obama had his so-called 'beer summit' at the White House this evening. It was a chance to sit down with Dr. Henry Louis Gates, the Harvard professor who was arrested after breaking into his own house, and Sergeant James Crowley, the policeman who arrested him. And there was one awkward moment, they say, when Crowley asked Obama for some ID, but he was just kidding it turned out.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Biden showed up too. I did not know he was going to be a part of it. I guess they wanted to even things out racially.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But they sat around a table in the Rose Garden, and drank. And I'm starting to think the President cooked this whole thing up because he didn't want to ask Michelle if he could have a poker night or something.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tomorrow morning will heretofore be known as Racial Harmony Hangover Day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I guess next week, Obama is going sit down with Jon and Kate to see if he can't patch that up too.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night President Obama, Professor Gates, and Officer Crowley had their beer summit. And the big surprise was they were joined by Vice President Biden. ... The highlight of the evening was when Officer Crowley told Biden, 'You have the right to remain silent.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama served Professor Gates and Officer Crowley beer and pretzels. ... It's the first time pretzels have been served at the White House since the time one attacked President Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is good, though. Last night's meeting went so well, did you hear this? Gates and Crowley planned to meet again. Isn't that nice? ... Apparently, they'll meet the next time Gates tries to get into his own house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The space shuttle landed today. I don't know if you heard about this. This is a weird story. There was a Japanese astronaut on board the space shuttle who says he didn't change his underwear for a month. ... He said he'd be still wearing them but the landing was a little scarier than he expected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nice to see you folks. Glad you're here. What a crowd last night. Whoo! Couldn't really blame them. The show was awful. It did not go well. ... Afterwards I got a call from President Obama and he said I acted stupidly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But, everything's okay now. President Obama has invited myself and Sarah Palin down to the White House for a beer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama...has been hard working. I mean, we don't know if he's getting anything done, but he's sure hard working. And so he's going on vacation. He's going to be...renting a big beach house on Martha's Vineyard. ... I want to tell you something -- nothing says vacation like two weeks on an island with your mother-in-law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's a weird story. Remember last...football season? Plaxico Burress, Super Bowl hero Plaxico Burress, for the Giants, he's arrested because...he goes&quot; into &quot;this nightclub, and he shoots himself in the leg. Well, he's going to have to serve two years in the clink for shooting himself in the leg. Last month, I shot myself in the foot and I only had to apologize to Sarah Palin. You see how that is?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin left office on Sunday. She's just not sitting around, no. A lot of people say, 'Well, what's she going to do?' Reality TV show. That's what she's got. 'Todd &amp; Sarah Plus 8.' Look out!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But no longer governor of Alaska. So whenever she waves at Russia, nobody waves back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy Friday! Thank you all for coming to my beer summit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I read online...this morning that President Obama's approval rating has dropped to an all-time low of 48%, or as George Bush calls it, 'Kicking ass.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's 48%. Obama should have listened to my high school principal. 'Drinking beer won't make people like you, Jimmy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama said today that Congress probably won't vote on his healthcare bill until October. Yeah, what's the rush, Congress? Take your time. It's not like there's some crazy flu epidemic out there or anything like that. Swine!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Nancy Pelosi accused insurance companies of deliberately trying to kill the healthcare bill. Pelosi was so angry that she started arranging her face into a scowl.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, I'm sure you heard, President Obama had the Harvard professor and the police officer who arrested him over to the White House to talk and, more importantly, get stinking drunk together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is interesting. Apparently, Joe Biden was upset that Obama had put his foot in the mouth by saying the Cambridge police acted stupidly because that's normally his thing. And Obama stole it.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But they had a beer or two or three or maybe four. And then, I guess things really got wild. About 2:30 this morning, Obama declared war on Iceland because he decided it wasn't icy enough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House is big, and it can be very a confusing place when you're buzzed. Apparently, the President woke up this morning spooning Rahm Emanuel.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is actually a true story. It was in the news today. The latest slang dictionary reports that the word Obama means 'cool,' as in 'you are so Obama.' ... Also gaining popularity: the phrase 'shut your Biden-hole.'&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First they had a beer at the White House. Well, now, Professor Gates and the cop who arrested him&quot; are &quot;planning to go to a Red Sox game. ... It's getting to be a bit much. Last night, they went to a piano bar and sang 'Ebony and Ivory.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The man who wrote many of the speeches for President George W. Bush is now working on his memoirs. True story. ... The book will be called 'Me Do Bad Job.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'The Washington Post' is doing a big story on the 2008 John McCain campaign. And it now says after all this research...that he picked Sarah Palin because of a 'high risk/high reward strategy.' ... Apparently, it's the same reason McCain uses Metamucil.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of Sarah Palin, former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin and her husband Todd are denying rumors that they're getting a divorce. ... When asked about it, Palin said, 'When have you ever known me to not see something through?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama just announced he's considering transferring prisoners from Guantanamo Bay to Michigan. ... The idea is to scare the prisoners into revealing information about terror plots by showing them a bus ticket to Detroit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A very happy birthday to President Obama, who turns 48 tomorrow. ... As a special gift, Joe Biden is giving him 24 hours of complete silence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, there was a rumor on the Internet this weekend that Sarah Palin was getting divorced. I knew that wasn't true, because when Sarah Palin takes an oath, she doesn't bail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, at a concert in Washington, DC, Paul McCartney dedicated the song 'Michelle' to Michelle Obama. And then, I thought this was sweet, he dedicated the song 'Taxman' to Barack.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This weekend, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin took a submarine to the bottom of Lake Baikal, the world's deepest lake. He got to see some rare exotic fish and his past political opponents.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's President Obama's 48th birthday. ... The President has asked that in lieu of sending a gift, people just make a donation to his favorite charity, General Motors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the big news today, and very nice news, is out of North Korea. You probably heard this. Today, former President Bill Clinton met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Il and convinced him to release two American journalists that have been jailed since March. ... Or, as Clinton calls it, 'another Asian happy ending.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bill Clinton got the two journalists released. This is fantastic news. And then afterwards, Clinton told the hostages, 'I, too, know what it's like to be held captive by an evil tyrant who wears ladies' sunglasses. I feel your pain.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Senator John McCain announced he's going to vote against... the confirmation of Sonia Sotomayor. ... However, McCain did say he thought she was great in 'West Side Story.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House today said that President Obama will not...call Iranian Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to congratulate him on his re-election. ... Even worse for Ahmadinejad, Joe Biden will call.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin is on vacation. And today -- I don't know if you saw this -- he was photographed on horseback without his shirt. ... The photograph won't appear in the newspaper, but it will appear on the cover of Danielle Steele's new novel 'Iron Fist, Velvet Heart.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The United States Postal Service says they might lose... $7 billion this year. ... Apparently, the post office will lose the seven billion when it mails the money to itself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a great day for our former President Bill Clinton. He went to North Korea and negotiated the release of two female journalists. He did it! Clinton agreed to go as soon as he found out the mission was picking up chicks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The two journalists are flying back with Bill Clinton on his jet. They told reporters they endured round-the-clock surveillance and repeated strip searches. And the prison was even worse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, congratulations to former President Bill Clinton. He traveled to North Korea today, met with Kim Jong Il and won the release of those two female journalists. ... It was...great&quot; for &quot;Obama to use Clinton that way. I think I know how he got him to go over there. You know, he's probably like, 'Bill, I need you to go to North Korea for me.' 'I can't do it. I'm completely booked. I have numerous obligations.' 'I want you to visit a woman's prison.' 'What time's my flight?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, very happy birthday to President Obama. He turned 48 today. Very good. ... It's great that everyone at the White House sang happy birthday, except for Joe Biden. He accidentally sang the launch codes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Brand new episodes of 'Jon &amp; Kate Plus 8' started airing last night. Oh, it was great. My favorite part was when Obama invited them over for beers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to say happy birthday today to Barack Obama. The President just turned 48 years old, if he was ever really born, that is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess it all depends on whether you believe his 'birth certificate' or not.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Obama's birthday is a reminder of why healthcare is so important. As you probably know, due to a lack of healthcare coverage, Obama's mother was turned away from a number of hospitals and was ultimately forced to give birth in a manger.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought this was nice. The First Lady, Michelle Obama, got him a brand new pair of her jeans for his birthday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But what do you get for the man who has Oprah, you know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Meanwhile, former President Bill Clinton is on his way home from North Korea right now. He made a surprise visit to attempt to secure the release of two female American journalists -- two young, shapely, attractive female journalists who were imprisoned by North Korean police after they illegally crossed the border from China.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I don't know what exactly Clinton said to North Korean dictator Kim Jong Il, but it worked because they released them. And I have to say it is nice to see Bill Clinton get a release he's not impeached for for a change. Right?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The rumor is they made a deal. Kim Jong Il gave the women a special pardon and in return he got 20 pairs of Hillary's pantsuits. So, a little something to spruce up his wardrobe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So that's pretty impressive. Clinton goes over there, frees the prisoners, and brings them back. I mean, that's like Rambo, you know. And by the way now -- plenty of time for the ladies to say thanks on the long plane ride home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And May God help any nation that tries to kidnap Megan Fox!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One thing I noticed from the pictures of the trip -- check this out ? here's Kim Jong Il, all right, seated there. And here's Mahmoud Amembersonlyjacket of Iran. The official uniform of the psychopathic leader is the khaki zip-up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is something. Because of the economy, the Postal Service is being forced to close several hundred post offices around the country. ... The Postal Service is facing a $7 billion budget short fall this year. So in addition to closing the post offices, they're also raising the price of a first-class stamp. It will now be $4,000. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it's a shame to see people out of work, but I have to admit I am looking forward to hearing postal workers complain how slow the lines are at the unemployment office. Right?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Clinton flew all the way to North Korea, under the cover of night, to rescue two beautiful women from the clutches of an evil dictator.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Pentagon's concerned that Facebook could pose a security risk to US military personnel...because apparently, there's no telling what Al Qaeda could do if it knows what a soldier's five favorite romantic comedies are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Clinton is &quot;back in America after going to North Korea and freeing two journalists. To be fair, it wasn't difficult for Bill. He's used to sneaking women out of government buildings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Bill Clinton's &quot;plane left North Korea with the women on board, there were jubilant celebrations, until Bill found out they were both married.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They landed in L.A. this morning. And it is quite a contrast between North Korea and L.A. One's a cruel place, filled with soulless people who are despised by most Americans. And of course, the other one is North Korea.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now that he's freed the journalists, Bill Clinton's next mission is get Paula Abdul back on 'American Idol.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House made it clear that, although Bill Clinton met with a world leader, he in no way speaks for the President of the United States. ... It's the same disclaimer they use when Joe Biden travels.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the imprisoned journalists said when she saw Bill Clinton, she knew her nightmare was over. I'm thinking, well, this is how times change. Ten years ago, when a woman saw Bill Clinton, she knew her troubles were about to begin.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just heard that President Obama made Vanity Fair's Best Dressed of 2009 list. So I guess they're not counting the ironed mom jeans he wore to the All-Star game?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Research shows that the use of antidepressants in the US has more than doubled over 10 years. Well, at least people who make antidepressants are happy, I guess.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Clinton, &quot;under cover of darkness, parachuted into North Korea with a knife in his teeth and a skull tattoo on his chest to rescue journalists Laura Ling and Euna Lee. And it was a 13-hour flight home, during which, citing standard rescue protocol, Clinton gave both women mouth-to-mouth no less than 15 times.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier this week -- this is the best story -- former President Clinton flew back from North Korea on a private jet, accompanied by two beautiful reporters who he rescued from being sent to an all-female prison camp. ... In other words, after years of wasting his time as President, Clinton has finally found his calling. ... He's never been happier.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House was reluctant to send Clinton to North Korea and imposed several conditions on the trip. ... First condition was that Clinton travel as a private citizen, second, that he not negotiate with Kim Jong Il, and third, he stop calling the trip 'a booty call.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today -- this is a huge story -- Mel Martinez, the Senate's only Hispanic Republican, announced he's stepping down. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a weird story. Someone recently tried to sell an Xbox that was autographed by Sarah Palin for $1.1 million. ... Unfortunately, the Palin Xbox kept quitting in the middle of every game.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On his radio show -- I can't believe he said this -- on his radio show, Rush Limbaugh recently said, 'Adolf Hitler, like Barack Obama, ruled by dictate.' ... So folks, it took a while but Obama has finally won over Rush Limbaugh, apparently.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Joe Biden and his wife Jill are in Kiawah Island, South Carolina, for a week-long vacation. ... They're saying it's the most relaxing vacation Obama has ever had.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you could tell when Joe Biden's been to the beach. He comes back with braided hair plugs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, despite losing 200,000 jobs in July, the unemployment rate dropped from 9.5% to 9.4%. I think that means a lot of people got hired to work at the unemployment office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But that small drop's not enough for Obama. To get that number even further, he promised to find Paula Abdul a job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Health experts are predicting that most people will need three shots to protect themselves during this year's flu season. That's perfect. I just did, like, six shots before the show, so I should be extra fine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A teacher in Malaysia forced a student to smoke 42 cigarettes in four hours as punishment after finding a cigarette in his locker. The student said, 'Hey, you know, I'm hiding weed and beer in here, too, right? I should be punished.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As the world is now aware, 'American Idol' next season will go on without Paula Abdul. Her manager...walked away from the negotiating table this week because she supposedly wanted $20 million a year. Paula told the Associated Press today, 'At this point there are many wonderful things being offered to me.' ... She's right. There are a lot of openings for crazy women right now. Gosselin girlfriend, 'Octomom' nanny, governor of Alaska is open.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, you don't hear much about gold mining anymore, but yesterday, our Governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, signed a bill that will ban gold miners from using gas-powered tools to look for gold in rivers.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now that Sonia Sotomayor has joined the Supreme Court, one third...of the justices are now from New York City. ... This explains why the customary opening of a court session has changed from 'All rise' to 'Hey, I'm judging over here!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of news this weekend. Sonia Sotomayor was sworn in as the 111th Supreme Court justice and only the third female in history. This is great. ... Now, Ruth Bader Ginsburg will finally have a yoga buddy.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is in Guadalajara, Mexico, for his first North American Leaders Summit. Very exciting. After that, he's expected to hold his first Imodium AD Summit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During his weekly radio address, Obama said we've finally begun to put the brakes on this recession, which is good news. Unfortunately, the brakes were built by General Motors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Regis Philbin's back in...primetime, hosting 11 new episodes of 'Who Wants To Be a Millionaire.' But because of Obama's tax plan, it's been re-titled 'Who Wants To Win Just Under $250,000.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A company in Michigan is trying to make Americans healthier...by sending out ice cream trucks stocked only with fruits and vegetables. ... It's not going so well, because all the trucks have been turned over and burned by angry, fat kids.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the past week, congressmen have been holding town hall meetings across the country. They've been disrupted by angry protesters who are against Obama's new healthcare plan. And things could have gotten violent, but nobody could afford to get hurt. So, it was very peaceful protesting.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, GM announced they'll be releasing a car that gets 230 miles a gallon. And today, Nissan said their new car's going to get 367 miles a gallon. It's crazy. ... In a related story, Toyota just announced their new car will get 500 miles per gallon, plant rain forests, and give birth to endangered pandas.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new report that just came out, NASA doesn't have enough money to track all the giant asteroids that could crash into Earth. ... NASA says we shouldn't worry though because they've given the job to Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During his town hall meeting in New Hampshire yesterday, President Obama tried to make a point about private companies and the government providing the same services. He said UPS and FedEx are doing just fine; it's the Post Office that's always having problems. That's probably going to anger some postal workers but...what's the worst that could happen?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But at the same meeting, he said twice that the AARP supports his healthcare plan, even though the AARP hasn't endorsed it. He's probably thinking of that other senior citizens group. What's the name? Oh, yeah, Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former President Bill Clinton was recently asked about his wife Hillary's 11-day trip to Africa. And he said, 'I wish she were home.' ... Then he said, 'By which, I mean, I wish her home was Africa.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of former President Clinton -- have you heard about this? There are two American male hikers and one female hiker imprisoned in Iran.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dick Cheney is back in the news. ... He's talking about his memoirs.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cheney...also explained that the statute of limitations has expired on remaining silent about the Bush Administration. Meanwhile, George Bush said, 'I love the statue of limitations. Beautiful lady. Is the torch open? Got to climb in the torch.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is interesting. Just before he went on his trip yesterday, I guess, an 11-year-old boy...interviewed President Obama and the boy asked Obama what to do about bullying. ... In response, Obama said, 'Shut up, nerd.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been reported that former Vice President Dick Cheney is hard at work on his memoirs. ... The book will be called 'The Five People You Meet in Hell.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's official. A paternity test revealed that John Edwards is, in fact, the biological father of his mistress' child. ... Experts say they could tell it was Edwards' DNA because it kept grooming itself in the microscope.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Edwards...finally admitted that he's the father of his mistress' baby after denying it for over a year. So, it's a pretty classic case of whoever denied it, supplied it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Edwards says he's ashamed, he can hardly look himself in the mirror. On the bright side, that frees up an extra four hours a day for him.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, before I came out here, I got some early results from the Afghanistanian election. And this just in, apparently Al Franken is ahead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You folks excited about the Afghanistan election? Well, don't get too excited because there's already reports of irregularities in Broward and Dade County.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The current Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, is opposed by the Taliban. You know the Taliban? Over here, the Taliban, we call them healthcare protestors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You think campaigning is difficult here in the United States. You try campaigning in Afghanistan.... You ever try to put a bumper sticker on a camel? I mean, come on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about this Brett Favre guy? He retires, then un-retires, then he retires, then he un-retires, then he retires and un-retires, then he retires again and un-retires. Now he's playing for the Minnesota Vikings. And it's not easy. ... I'm not saying he's old, but he's getting older. Before playing, he had to pass a rigorous physical and also a death panel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They did this survey of money down there in Washington, DC. I'm talking about cash money. And they found that 90% of all of our currency has traces of the drug cocaine on it. Yeah. And I said, 'Well no wonder Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke is so crazy!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's something else came to us from a new survey. You folks like to eat fish? You enjoy seafood? Boy, I do. ... When they got done testing money in Washington, they tested fish in the United States. And they found out that every single fish in the test contained mercury. Jeremy Piven said, 'Well who's laughing now?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wait a minute, hey. What is...this, an audience or a death panel?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But you know, this is a great thing about the United States of America. We take any situation, make it something good. You know, we are a glass half full country. ... Mrs. Paul's, the fish sticks people, they heard about the mercury in the fish and they've come out now with a tasty new fish stick which you can also use to take your temperature.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Squeaky Fromme&quot; has &quot;been in prison since the '70s for trying to shoot...President Gerald Ford. Out of prison now. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who Squeaky Fromme is? Weird deal. One of the original Manson Family members, Squeaky Fromme, and she took a shot at President Gerald Ford. This was back in the 70s. They locked her up and she's been in prison the entire time. Well, now she's being let out of prison. ... And guess what, guys? She's single.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congress has been agonizing over healthcare for months now. Squabbling, fighting, the town hall meetings going crazy. Meanwhile, while they're arguing about healthcare, we're stuck in two wars that were rubber stamped in about 10 minutes. What? How does that make any sense when you think about it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But have you seen these town hall meetings about the healthcare? People are screaming. And I'll tell you if it's one thing Americans hate, it's comprehensive health coverage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are always saying to me, 'Well, Dave, are you worried about healthcare?' No, I'm not worried about healthcare and I'll tell you why; because I'm with CBS. ... They have a tremendous healthcare plan. And here's what it is. Simply, when I die, when I die, I get to appear on a 'CSI' show as a corpse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm very glad you people are here, and I kind of mentioned this earlier, but last night, we had a terrible audience. ... Honestly, they were so bad I didn't know if they were an audience or a death panel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll tell you something, ladies and gentlemen, if I want to see a death panel, I'll tune into a George Stephanopoulos roundtable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of death panels. Dick Cheney said, 'Death panel? Count me in!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember when the Obama kids first went to the White House and the Bush twins were showing the Obama kids around the White House. And remember what happened? They heard this horrible scream coming from the cellar where Dick Cheney had his dungeon. Remember that? Anyway, Dick Cheney has a brand new book. It's a memoir about his life and times, and I believe the title of it is called 'Too Fat to Waterboard.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I didn't know this, but according to the book, there was a time when President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney weren't speaking. They got into a fight and they weren't speaking. It really got so bad that earlier today, President Obama invited them both to the White House for a beer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Cheney said that President Bush, there was a point during the second term, that he stopped listening to the Vice President. George Bush stopped listening to his Vice President. And I said to myself, 'Whoa. Well, maybe this guy wasn't as dumb as we thought.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of presidents, President Obama vacationing in Martha's Vineyard. ... And in honor of Obama's trip to Martha's Vineyard, a local Mexican restaurant is serving a dish called the 'Baracko Taco.'

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, 'Cash for Clunkers' ended today. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. Last week's radio address was 10 minutes of snoring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Switched from beer summits to tequila summits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Asked CIA director what we're doing about the terrorist organization, 'al Pacino.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Staffers often find him on White House roof, meowing like a kitty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Announced he's sending an elite military unit to kill Hitler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Lately, he's been fist-bumping staffers in the face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Asked for the number of Rush Limbaugh's OxyContin guy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Called Bush for advice on sneaking naps during intelligence briefings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Been babbling nonsense about government 'death panels' ? no, wait, that's a sign Sarah Palin needs a vacation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Barely has the energy to smoke.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's talk that the elections last week in Afghanistan were rigged. Boy, I didn't see that coming.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Couple of years ago down in Cuba, Fidel Castro they thought, oh, he might be dying because he had some kind of surgery and...he is an older fellow, in is 80s. ... But now, over the weekend, it's all Fidel Castro. He is everywhere. And he was on television. He looked fit. He looked healthy. He looked happy. He was so impressive, as a matter of fact, CIA is actually thinking of sending Squeaky Fromme down there to take a shot at him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama&quot; is &quot;taking a vacation on Martha's Vineyard. Earlier today, you know, bound to happen, awkward moment. He is out on the beach, runs into John McCain looking for coins with a metal detector.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But President Obama says he's going to play golf, he's going to swim, and he's going to work his way through the Julia Child cookbook.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Obama is spending the week at a $30,000 dollar-a-week beach house. ... And they call this guy a socialist? Come on!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Obama is going to take two weeks to unwind, as opposed to President Bush, who never wound.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Miss Venezuela is our new Miss Universe, ladies and gentlemen. Beautiful, beautiful. She came out dressed as a barrel of overpriced oil.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the Miss Universe pageant is fascinating. It's judged on poise -- you have to have poise -- judged on beauty, and also how you walk in high heels. What a coincidence, it's also how the Republicans pick a vice presidential candidate. The same criteria.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody take advantage of the government's 'Cash for Clunkers' program? I was able to unload a couple of shows from last week.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House is...denying rumors that President Obama has plans to play a round of golf with Tiger Woods...although Obama is planning to ask Tiger Woods if the government can borrow $300 trillion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is weird. North Korean dictator Kim Jong Il recently met with the CEO of Hyundai. ... Apparently, the story is Hyundai wants to build cars in North Korea while Kim wants to use their windshields as sunglasses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You folks have been following, probably, the elections in Afghanistan. You know what's going on over there? ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apparently, they say there was cheating, voter intimidation, miscounted votes,&quot; and &quot;one of the candidates may have been sleeping with Paula Abdul.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But one of the guys on the ballot is a candidate named Abdullah Abdullah. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a big vacation week in Martha's Vineyard. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They've developed a special cocktail to commemorate Obama's visit to Martha's Vineyard. It's the Obamarita. ... They did the same thing when Bill Clinton would vacation up there -- the cocktail was the screwdriver.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you're President of the United States, you don't get a vacation, you don't get time off, it's around the clock, 365. ... For example, today, President Obama had to interrupt his vacation to announce the appointment once again of chairman of the Fed Ben Bernanke. ... In order to keep him, they promised to give him the 10:00 p.m. slot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But if you remember, the...chairman of the Fed used to be Alan Greenspan, and then in 2006, I think Ben Bernanke replaced&quot; him after &quot;Greenspan...got in trouble for organizing dogfights. Do you remember that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama...is taking his summer vacation on Martha's Vineyard this week. ... It's a good time for the President to slip out of the town. The deficit is supposed to be a lot higher than people expected, the swine flu, as you know, is getting ready to kill us all and Regis is having a birthday party today, which means fire and possibly looting in New York.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the news has not been all bad. The 'Cash for Clunkers' program was a big hit. ... It ended yesterday. The idea was if you have a car that guzzles gas, you can get $4,500 for abandoning it on the White House lawn, or something like that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And another 'Cash for Clunkers' program, I guess they're scheduling for like, six months from now, when the Minnesota Vikings try to trade Brett Favre.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The original plan, you know, was to destroy these cars that people traded in just to get them off the road, but instead they've decided to do something productive with them. They're going to donate the cars. Instead of piling them up in a junkyard, the government has decided to send them to Third World countries so that children who don't have cars can wear them as clothes. And I think that ? that's what they call a win-win.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's the way it stands now. Hamid Karzai is leading in the election and he picked up a lot of swing voters, they said, in the Afghanistan elections, because of his No Infidel Left Behind program.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Boy oh, boy, they got a new memo from the CIA talking about torture activities. Don't you love that kind of stuff?

And people on Martha's Vineyard...are going crazy and they're buying Obama t-shirts, they're buying Obama mugs, they're buying Obama caps. The only thing they're not buying is Obama's healthcare plan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama has a great money-saving idea for...healthcare. ... Here's what he's saying -- if you need an X-ray and you don't have the money or you don't have proper health coverage and you need that X-ray, just drop by an airport, go right through the scanner. They'll send you the results.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama, on Martha's Vineyard, is playing golf with Tiger Woods. ... Tiger is hoping Obama's new healthcare plan will cover chocking.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama enjoying himself. He's having his vacation in Martha's Vineyard all week. So far -- this is what the news says -- so far, he's played tennis, golf; he's gone swimming. Now it's rumored he may play a game of bocce ball. It's true. In other words, America is still waiting for its first black president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday in Arizona, Sen. John McCain...had an out of control woman thrown out of a town hall meeting because she wouldn't stop yelling at him. ... I'm guessing he still hasn't patched things up with Sarah Palin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of John McCain,&quot; he &quot;says that people are so angry and concerned about America's future, that he sees a revolution coming. ... McCain said, 'I had this exact same feeling in 1776.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has been a victim of identity theft. ... His credit card company became suspicious when they noticed repeated purchases of large, failing American car companies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a big presidential election in Afghanistan and President Hamid Karzai's opponent is a man named Abdullah Abdullah. ... Of course, he usually goes by his middle name, Kevin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Signs You're Dealing With A Ben Bernanke Impostor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. Keeps offering to 'print ya' up a bucket a' twenties.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. The phony giant, wooly beard taped to his face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Claims he's the star of 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Bernanke.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Doesn't have Bernanke's famous neck tattoo of Tupac and Biggie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. You ask if the Dow is down and he says, 'No, he seemed in fine spirits to me.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Business card has 'Federal Reserve Chairman' scribbled over 'Sears Appliances.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. You see him eating a chicken salad sandwich. (Note: Ben Bernanke hates chicken salad.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. When you ask if lowering the Fed Funds Rate will create deflation, he says a Keynesian expansion of consumer demand will offset any deflationary spiral, when in fact the real guy would have cited Milton Friedman's belief that the M1 and M2 money supply would be energized by increased volatility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. He's handsome, but he's not 'Bernanke handsome.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. His plan to fix the economy? Don't change a thing!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke&quot; will &quot;serve four more years, or until the United States becomes a colony of China.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bernanke...looks like a guy you see at the airport holding a sign that reads Dr. Rothman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He looks like a guy who ran a Madoff feeder fund.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He looks like a personal physician to a pop star.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He looks like a medical examiner on 'Kojak.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, here's an example of why we're all screwed. ... You know the stimulus checks that the government's sending out? ... Thousands of these stimulus checks have been sent to prison inmates. Well, I'm pretty sure they'll give 'em back. I mean, if you can't trust a con who -- I mean, seriously.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's all part of Obama's new 'Cash for Convicts' program.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The good news is the checks arrived today, just in time for the big dance on Saturday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, wait a minute, you know on Sunday, it'll be 16 years that Paul and I and everybody else have been here at CBS on the 'Late Show.' ... Sixteen years, ladies and gentlemen. I've been torturing people longer than Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But according to a newly released memo from the CIA, they used horrible torture techniques on prisoners. ... Dick Cheney...claimed that it wasn't torture. ... Enhanced interrogation techniques, that's what he called it, enhanced interrogation technique. And he didn't shoot that guy in the face. No, no, that was enhanced quail hunting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama family vacationing on Martha's Vineyard and Obama has been mostly relaxing with just a little bit of work. And you know, that sounds like George Bush's entire eight years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the entire island of Martha's vineyard has gone Obama crazy and there's even like a cocktail that they've named after Barack Obama. It's the Obamarita, not to be confused with a cocktail inspired by John McCain, the Cosmopolygrip. And then there was one a couple of years ago inspired by George W. Bush, the Mojidiot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain is out there in Arizona. ... He had a town hall meeting and you know these town hall meetings. Have you been watching? ... They've got out of hand completely. There's one old guy, had a gun rack on his walker, honestly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;McCain at one point had to have a crazy woman removed by security at one of these town hall meetings. ... And I'm thinking, jeez, he should have done that a year ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Publishers are saying that every time President Obama is seen reading a book on his vacation, sales of that book skyrocket. ... And historians are saying we experienced this before, when President Bush was photographed reading 'Everybody Poops.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Healthcare debate, of course, still rages. John McCain in the middle of the debate now. Earlier this week, in a television interview, John McCain said he has never experienced anything like the current debate on healthcare. Then McCain turned to the camera and said, 'I've also never experienced anything like the rich, bold flavor of new Lemon Zest Metamucil.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;California trying very hard to get out of debt. This weekend -- I can't believe this -- the government of California is holding a garage sale to raise money for the state. ... Now, folks, even if you don't really need anything, this may be your only chance to haggle with Governor Schwarzenegger over a $2 spatula. I think it would be worth ? 'You've got to take it right now! It's very good! Good for flipping sausages; $1.79. I'll throw in the garden hose. Just take it! Take it now!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of new information coming out about the CIA interrogation techniques. They're investigating the CIA on interrogation of terror suspects. And it was reported now that CIA torture techniques include making terror suspects wear diapers. ... The CIA calls this technique 'The Larry King.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;China has started selling iPhones, but China insists that they be sold with their Wi-Fi function disabled. ... Apparently, they'll disable the iPhone Wi-Fi the same way we do in the US, by using AT&amp;T.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about this? ... According to financial experts, including Ben Bernanke, the recession may be over. Great, wait till we tell the 11 million people without jobs!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank God the recession is over, because now I will be able to quit my second job. ... I had to make ends meet. Maybe you saw me. I worked out in Long Island at the Wal-Mart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Listen to this, ladies and gentlemen. I am telling you, it is a wonder we don't just get dizzy, collectively, as a nation, because constantly, mixed messages. On the one hand...we are getting healthy -- eat salads, do sit-ups.&quot; But &quot;if you go to the KFC right now, you get a sandwich&quot; that has &quot;bacon and cheese between two slices of fried chicken.... And I am thinking, Congress better hurry up with the healthcare reform.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;KFC now serving two slices of meat between two slices of meat. Ladies and gentlemen, this is why the rest of the world hates us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the Obama family is taking a vacation up there in Martha's Vineyard. It is a good time for the President to take a vacation, I think. I mean, everything is fixed, right? Well, why not knock off?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama may play a round of golf with Tiger Woods. That is a little different than President Clinton on vacation. He just liked to play around.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy birthday John McCain -- 73 years old tomorrow. ... And if you are looking for a gift, you can't go wrong with something from the Very Old Navy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John's had a tremendous career. Ran for president. Sarah Palin was his running mate for vice president. ... And now, John's at Applebee's blowing on his soup.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What a way to end the summer here in the United States. There's a tropical storm headed towards the East Coast and the West Coast is on fire. ... The state of California, by the way, is $30 billion in debt and there's no way to pay it back. So what we've decided to do is just set it all on fire and collect the insurance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Meanwhile, President Obama is desperately trying to take a vacation, which is not working out so well. Yesterday, he did get a chance to take his daughters for a bike ride, but he's getting criticism because he wasn't wearing a helmet. ... And some people say that sets a bad example. But what people those people don't know is the President doesn't need to wear a helmet. ... Let's say Obama is riding his bike and let's say his bike hits a rock. He flies over the handle bars, but as soon as he does, his ears automatically extend like wings, flying him up, up to Heaven, where he gives Jesus a high-five and gently comes back to the ground. So no helmet necessary.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Reporters in Washington are saying that President Obama's hair has gotten visibly grayer in the seven months since he took office. ... Amazingly, each of his gray hairs is the result of a black hair and a white hair being brought together by Obama last year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a new interview, Dick Cheney says former President Bush ignored his advice to take military action against Iran's nuclear program. That's true. Bush also ignored Cheney's advice to attack Switzerland, Jamaica, and Antarctica.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Top Ten Ways To Irritate Dick Cheney:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. Try to talk to him before he's had his morning heart attack</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Don't have weapons of mass destruction he keeps saying you had.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Reveal plot spoilers before he's had a chance to watch 'Gossip Girl.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Leave the lights on in the dungeon ? 'You think I'm made of money?!?!'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. 'Accidentally' throw out tub of Crisco he was saving for lunch</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Call him 'Ricky.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Beat him in sneering contest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Replace Lipitor with refreshing Mentos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. At dinner, ask, 'Who's got a good hunting accident story?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Irritate Cheney? No, he's a pretty laid back dude.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's interesting to me that since they've been out of office, Dick Cheney has really got his nose out of joint. Have you noticed this? He's out there. He's upset. He's attacking people. He's shooting his mouth off. And now he is criticizing the Obama Administration for looking into the CIA torture policy. ... He says...'You shouldn't be looking into the CIA torturing policy.' He made that announcement, then...he went back to his private island to hunt human prey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Cheney says he won't cooperate with the prisoner abuse program probe. The only way we cooperate is if he tortures himself into talking. And he said, 'I'm not going to do that.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cheney accused Obama of setting a 'terrible precedent.' That's what Cheney said, Obama is setting a 'terrible precedent,' not to be confused with George W. Bush, who was a terrible president. ... That's a different deal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it's back. You know what I'm talking about. Swine flu. ... And they say now this year it may be worse than ever. And I was thinking, well, thank God we fixed our healthcare system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was a minor earthquake in South Carolina. ... As a matter of fact, Governor Sanford, because of the minor earthquake, was actually knocked on to his wife.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know, now they're talking that Governor Sanford may be impeached for having an affair. And today, he was made an honorary Democrat, so congratulations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you remember when George W. Bush was the President?... Eight years of big time fun. And he had the daughters, the Bush twins. And well, listen to this. One of the Bush twins, Jenna, 27 years old now, not just a kid. ... So now, listen this. Jenna Bush -- talk about a great gig ? is going to be on the 'Today' show. ... And if there is anything this country needs, it's more of that family. They can't get enough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I...just hope she has her father's facility with words. That would be nice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They say Jenna will contribute about once a month. It's the same schedule her old man had.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama and his family&quot; took a &quot;vacation on Martha's vineyard and they're back. And the President now has asked all of the major networks for some air time tomorrow night to show his vacation photos.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But now here's the deal. When are you a president, you can't do anything. People always looking for you to make some kind of trouble for you. Did you see the picture of Barack Obama out bicycling with the kids? He's...not wearing a helmet. And people are all over him now. And I, well, I hope this guy has got some pretty good health insurance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe the President is the most prominent Democrat to go without protection since John Edwards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Jenna Bush was hired as a correspondent for the 'Today' show. People wonder if her dad was a factor in her getting the job. If he was, it looks like she overcame it and got the job anyway.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big announcement at NBC. George Bush's daughter, Jenna, was just hired as a correspondent on the 'Today' show. The show said they wanted someone who would make Kathie Lee look sober.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Things are getting tough for President Obama. Every day, he slips a couple of points in the approval. He's now at 45%, mainly because of this healthcare thing.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I like that Cheney. ... In eight years as Vice President, the only thing we knew about Dick Cheney was he was always in an undisclosed location. ... That and he shot his buddy in the face.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But now, he can't keep his mouth closed, and he's talking about he's really upset with the Obama Administration about the CIA torture probe.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The two Asian American journalists who were held captive in North Korea and rescued by president Clinton? Well, they have finally written about their ordeals.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's something kind of odd though. On my lunch break I was walking through Central Park and I saw a rabbi wearing his swine flu mask as a yamulke.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

Talk about your dream ticket, ladies and gentlemen. Oh buddy, the comedy recession is over. ... But Sarah apparently is making some dough. She's going around the world speaking.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is unbelievable, our governor Arnold Schwarzenegger ... shows up to survey the damage and pats the firefighters on the back. That's what governors do.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a crazy story. Have you heard about the guards at the U.S. Embassy in Afghanistan? ... You have to imagine when you go to work at a company called Whackenhut, there are going to be some shenanigans. They released some photographs and I thought it would be fun to play a game.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is weird. A new&quot; book that is &quot;coming out...claims that Osama bin laden is a huge Whitney Houston fan. ... Experts say that helps explain why bin Laden's latest video repeatedly calls for 'death to Bobby Brown.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Despite the announcement today that the unemployment hit 9.7%, Joe Biden said that the recovery is more than we had hoped.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, President Obama delivered a speech to America's schoolchildren. And he encouraged them to work hard and study hard. ... Yeah, then he said if that doesn't work, grab the seat next to the Asian kid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O' Brien:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama &quot;told them, this is a quote, 'Be careful what you post on facebook.' That's what he said. Obama then told them about bad things that could happen, like the time he accidentally friended Joe Biden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama said if he could have dinner with anyone in history, he was asked this, he said if he could have dinner with anyone in history he would pick Gandhi. That's right, yeah. Yeah, yeah, very good answer. Yeah. Yeah, Obama says he picked Gandhi because he'd get to eat two entrees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Labor day is the great American holiday where we honor American workers by going out and buying products made in China.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former President Bush &quot;learned a great deal, a lot of things from Tony Blair. Cheeky. He learned about cheeky. He learned the word fortnight. Learned bangers and mash. And Blair learned some things from George W. Bush. Oops. Uh-oh. Dang.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;There's rumors that Dick Cheney, Vice President Dick Cheney, may run for president in 2012. 2012. No, no. That's his cholesterol.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They said to Dick Cheney, really, seriously, why would you think about after eight years as Vice President, why would you think about running for president? Cheney said, 'well I still get a kick out of starting wars.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I remember when the Obamas first moved in and the Bush girls were given the Obama girls a tour of the White House. And the little girls got scared because they heard the organ music coming from Dick Cheney's underground dungeon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama addressed the United States school children. He had like a speech and it went right to the classes and the kids. Then I thought, wait a minute. He might be trying a little too hard. You know what I'm talking about? At the end he invited all the kids to the White House for a beer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people were upset. They said that Obama was going to get in there in the school rooms and start brain washing the kids. ... At first I was skeptical. But I was talking to my son after he came home from school today. Honest to God, he said, 'Must have socialized medicine.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama told the kids to work hard and listen to their teachers. Ladies and gentlemen, what a load of socialist propaganda. Work hard and listen to your teachers? I don't think so.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President also told the kids that sleep is very important because it helps the development of the brain. Sleep very important. That's what the President said. He told the kids sleep is so important that they should go to bed right after Jay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some Republicans were so mad&quot; about Obama's speech to schoolchildren, &quot;they had Dick Cheney give a rebuttal. He showed kids the proper way to stuff a geek into a locker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During his speech to American school children earlier today, President Obama said that what you make of your education will decide nothing less than the future of this country. But no pressure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President also said that kids -- he told them if they study hard, the United States will continue to prosper. Then he added, 'But just to be safe, bone up on your Chinese.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama giving a lot of very important speeches. He gave a speech about healthcare tonight, and yesterday he gave a pep talk to students. ... He told them that in order to succeed they need to work hard and study hard. ... Then...today, former President George W. Bush presented the rebuttal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, when President Obama addressed the country's schoolchildren, he told them to stop dreaming about becoming professional athletes. ... In fact, it was the same exact speech Obama gave last year to the Los Angeles Clippers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Florida's Republican governor, Charlie Crist, got a hold of President Obama's speech to students in advance, because everyone was talking about how controversial it might be. He decided there was nothing partisan and he allowed his kids to watch it. ... Of course, like everyone else in Florida, Crist's kids are in their late 60s.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The University of Wyoming recently announced they are naming an international student center after former Vice President Dick Cheney...because if there are two things that make you think welcome foreigners, it's Dick Cheney and Wyoming.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At a press conference this week, NASA made a big announcement. They announced that they've created a magnetic device that can levitate mice. ... NASA's spokesperson said, 'If you don't let us go to Mars, this is the kind of stupid crap we're going to do.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's kind of an interesting deal. This is the sort of thing that happens only in the United States and I guess we're happy about that. ... You go onto the eBay,&quot; and &quot;you can bid on...having dinner. You fly to Alaska and have dinner with the former governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin. ... And the bidding starts at $25,000. I know a lot of people think that's a pretty steep price to pay but you get an appetizer, you get entr?e, and ammo. So, not that bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And for an extra $1,000, she'll treat you like John McCain and cut up your meat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Sarah Palin, very serious now she's out of office up there in Alaska. She wrote a critique of President Obama's healthcare plan and then she went back to seating customers at the Olive Garden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And how about...Dick Cheney? Remember when Dick Cheney was Vice President for eight years and you never heard anything out of Dick Cheney. Here's what we knew about Dick Cheney. Always at an undisclosed location and the other thing is he shot his buddy in the face; those are the only two things we knew about Dick Cheney. Now, we can't keep him quiet. He's talking about maybe running for president in 2012. ... And he says he's willing to return to the White House, he'll go back to the White House, but only if he can bring his assistant, Egor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cheney's got a great campaign slogan. It says, 'Are you better off now than you were four heart attacks ago?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, you know, this was a big stink about this. ... President Obama spoke to the kids, the school kids, and...people were upset. They said, 'Hey, whoa, no!' They were upset that he was going to somehow -- that it would be some sort of political thing, he was trying to brainwash the kids. Here's what he said. He said to the kids, 'Hey, kids' ? that's how he opened ? 'work hard, get good grades, be constructive members of society.' Well, that Commie. Come on, what's he trying to pull? What's going on here?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Then, earlier tonight, President Obama spoke to Congress to explain his healthcare plan and Speaker Nancy Pelosi is very happy because apparently her Botox is covered, so that's good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And also under the healthcare plan, pop stars will still be able to choose their own creepy personal physicians. So that'll be good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Obama's been trying to pass a healthcare plan. Meanwhile, John McCain is trying to pass a kidney stone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see president Obama's address to Congress? It was on earlier tonight. ... It must have gone well because NBC is going to run it five nights a week. You know that's a sign of success.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was big night on television tonight. And instead of showing President Obama's healthcare speech that was on tonight, Fox aired its season premiere of 'So You Think You Can Dance.' I guess they wanted to give viewers a choice between hearing what's wrong with our country and watching what's wrong with our country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fox aired 'So You Think You Can Dance' and 'Glee.' So, you'll probably spend the next couple of days explaining the healthcare plan to your gay friends.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama gave his speech before a joint session of Congress, and college students across the country held a joint session before watching it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The University of Wyoming will open the new Dick Cheney Center for International Students. Cheney is planning on attending. He's going to take part in the ceremonial ribbon shooting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Dick Cheney Center for International Students. It's just two buildings over from the George W. Bush Institute for Pretzel Safety.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama gave his big pitch to a joint session of Congress tonight. A joint session of Congress is very rare. It's when the House and Senate get baked out of their minds and have a session of Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republican Congressman Joe Wilson's apologized for calling President Obama a 'liar' during his speech on healthcare. ... Obama accepted Wilson's apology and then invited him to appear before a death panel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During last night's healthcare speech, President Obama told Republicans, 'The time for games has passed.' That's a quote. ... Obama had to say that because most Republicans were on their BlackBerries playing BrickBreaker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, earlier today...President Obama gave another speech about healthcare, this one to a roomful of nurses. ... Still no word on what Bill Clinton was doing there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Florida Senator Mel Martinez, the only Hispanic Republican in the senate, officially stepped down. ... The Republican senator who replaced Martinez thanked him, and then had him deported.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, it's been reported that North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Il has chosen Kim Jon-Un to be his successor, because as you know, North Korean law requires the power to be handed over to the guy listed behind you in the phone book.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten South Carolina Representative Joe Wilson Excuses:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know Bernie Madoff, the greatest crook in the 21st century, Bernie Madoff, swindled $65 billion, mostly from old women? Yeah. Bernie, bad guy. Well, today it was revealed that he actually coached witnesses how to deceive the Securities and Exchange Commission. Well, he's in trouble now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about this? Ellen DeGeneres is going to be one of the new judges on...'American Idol.' It's not official yet. It still has to be confirmed by the Senate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Paula Abdul, of course, was the judge that Ellen DeGeneres is replacing. But don't worry about Paula Abdul. You know what she is going to do? I just heard this today. She's running for governor of Alaska.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of people running for stuff, Dick Cheney might run for president in 2012. ... Well, you got to start somewhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I like...that Cheney. He looks like the guy that tells you that the bridge is out and you'll have to spend the night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He looks like the chemical company executive who's ducking '60 Minutes' all the time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what? It's true. If you hang around long enough, you're going to see stuff you've never seen before. Like last night during President Obama's speech -- I have never seen this in a presidential speech, a congressional chamber -- a congressman heckled him. ... This guy from South Carolina, congressman, begins to heckle the guy. And I thought, okay, so, now Governor Mark Sanford is the second most embarrassing politician from South Carolina.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And John McCain, here's a guy who has seen it all. He was shocked. John McCain was shocked. He said he hadn't seen anything like this since Aaron Burr heckled John Hamilton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi also shocked. At least that's what she said. You can't tell because her face doesn't move.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Sarah Palin had a big op-ed piece in....'The Wall Street Journal,' and she said that she's against death panels. I said, 'Really? She is the one that pulled the plug on the McCain campaign.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see President Obama's healthcare speech to Congress last night? ... Congressman Joe Wilson of South Carolina yelled during the speech. ... Back when George Bush was President, Democrats in Congress, to be fair, they would occasionally go 'booo.' President Bush never took it personally. He just thought Congress was haunted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After Joe Wilson's outburst last night, everyone was shocked. Usually when a politician shoots his mouth off and makes a fool of himself, his name is Joe Biden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But even Vice President Biden said he was embarrassed by Wilson's behavior. This is Joe Biden we're talking about! If Joe Biden says it's embarrassing, then it's really embarrassing, like an Australian bartender saying you've had too much to drink.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even John McCain chastised Wilson for shouting. When you're McCain's age, you're opposed to anything loud.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It doesn't matter what the Congressman thinks about the President's policies, but he acts like he learned manners in the same place Michael Vick learned about pet care.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody is talking about the big health speech last night. ... In his speech, President Obama said that he will not sign a healthcare plan that adds one dime to the Federal deficit. And then he interrupted himself and said, 'You lie!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President said that he wants to bring affordable healthcare insurance to every American. Joe Biden got really excited. He thought he was finally going to meet the GEICO gecko.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama made his big healthcare address to a joint session of Congress last night. It went pretty well, except for one weird part in the middle of it when a congressman from South Carolina suddenly yelled out, 'You lie!' It's amazing. This guy was able to sit through seven years of President Bush telling him 'everything in Iraq is fine,' but -- without a peep -- but last night, he yells out, 'You lie!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even his fellow Republicans were horrified. He apologized immediately after the speech. He said he was watching 'Gossip Girls' on his iPod and that Blair is such a bitch he just couldn't hold it in.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Been a busy week for President Obama. I notice that he's having Kanye West and Taylor Swift to the White House for a 'root beer summit' this weekend. See, she's only 19. So, it's got to be root beer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, people are still talking about last week when President Obama gave his speech on healthcare and that Republican congressman yelled out, 'You lie!' He yelled out, 'You lie!' to the President. So, at least the two sides are talking. You know, and that's good. There's dialogue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Joe Biden really upset about President Obama being interrupted. He said, 'Hey, that's my job.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the President spoke about some of the scare tactics that are being used to fight healthcare reform. And I tell you, some of them are pretty scary. Like, have you seen this new commercial where this older couple gets mailed a box from Liberty Medical and it's got Wilford Brimley's head in it? Have you seen that one?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And while we were off, the government started this program that gives people money for their old cars. I made $5 billion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yet another...family values Republican has been caught in a sex scandal. I love this story. This time, California Assemblyman Mike Duvall -- the guy is married -- was caught on tape bragging about having sex with two different lobbyists. A politician having sex with two lobbyists. Now, I'm no mathematician, but I believe that's a total of three whores. Right?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, hey, and the University of Wyoming will open the new Dick Cheney Center for International Students. And really, who loves foreigners more than Dick Cheney?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to the 'Wall Street Journal,' Wal-Mart will now pay its workers in the United States electronically. I mean, it'll still be in pesos, but electronic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Osama bin Laden...has released a new audio recording slamming the President, America, Israel and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. ... Then at the end, when he's really worked up, he yells, 'And Beyonce had one of the best videos of all time!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, you all saw this. This is what I'm talking about. Kayne West at the Video Music Awards. Kayne West interrupted Taylor Swift's acceptance speech. And after he did that, after he was done interrupting her, MTV...threw him out of the building. ... So it's official. MTV has a lower tolerance for bad behavior than the United States Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of rude outbursts lately. ... Kayne West slamming Taylor Swift at the VMAs, Serena Williams screaming at the line judge. They've gotten so much attention, Kayne and Serena will be joining Congressmen Joe Wilson on a new show called, 'America's Got A-holes.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama, of course, hard at work, traveling the country, selling his healthcare plan. He's going everywhere. This weekend, in Minnesota, President Obama spoke about healthcare reform, and he warned Americans not to be tricked by scare tactics. ... Then someone yelled out, 'What do you call sending a black man to Minnesota?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Osama bin Laden released a new 11-minute audio tape, where he calls President Obama powerless in the war in Afghanistan. Well, that was the first six minutes. He gave Taylor Swift the last five to finish her acceptance speech.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This Saturday in Washington, over 70,000 people protested because they think President Obama is trying to shove government healthcare down their throats; also known as the 'Serena Williams option.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This Kanye West/Taylor Swift thing will not go away. ... Even former President Bush spoke out about it today. He said, 'Kanye West doesn't care about white people.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday in New York City, President Obama gave a tough speech to the Wall Street Executives. See, Wall Street is considered a safe place for Obama. You see, on Wall Street, if someone yells out 'you lie,' you could be talking to anybody.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And folks, they are doing it again. ... It's being reported that Goldman Sachs gave out $11 billion in bonuses. ... But they told their executives to be discreet with their money. What do you mean their money? ... It's our money!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to some reports coming out of Washington today, President Obama said Kanye West is a 'jackass.' ... Not since 'yes, we can' has Obama found a slogan so many Americans can get behind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday in New York, President Obama had lunch with former President Clinton. ... Afterwards, Clinton told Obama, 'Remember, if Hillary asks, we had lunch and dinner, then I slept over at your place.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, President Obama is pushing so hard for healthcare, he's going to appear on an unprecedented five shows this Sunday. ... What's strange is, two of them are 'Entourage' and 'Family Guy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new book that's coming out about former President George W. Bush said that Bush once called Barack Obama 'a cat' with 'no clue.' ... Of course that was back when Bush's speeches were written by jazz legend Wynton Marsalis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A group of musicians that includes Khalil Fong, the Scorpions, and Youssou N'Dour are recording a song in an effort to raise awareness of global warming. ... First, they have to raise awareness about who those musicians are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even the President is talking about Kanye West. Did you hear about this? In an off the record remark recorded by ABC, Obama said that Kanye West was a quote, unquote, 'jackass.' In even bigger news, ABC doesn't understand the meaning of the phrase 'quote, unquote, off the record.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kanye was pretty hurt when he heard the President called him a 'jackass.' But then Joe Biden said, 'Ah, you get used to it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is on a media campaign for his healthcare program. He'll appear this Sunday on 'This Week,' 'Meet the Press,' Face the Nation,' CNN's 'State of the Union,' and 'Univision.' Meanwhile, Vice President Biden will find out if he's the father on 'Maury Povich.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President says he's also going to appear on 'David Letterman' next Monday night. That's great for David. The best we could get was the guy from the free credit report commercial.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know that Iraqi journalist who threw his shoes at President Bush? Well, he was released today after nine months in prison. ... He said he was tortured while he was in prison. This poor guy, they made him bathe every single day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After two months of intense review, a Homeland Security task force is expected to recommend that the Obama Administration keep the color coded terror alert system they'd been planning to get rid of. ... Actually, they're considering going with...what they're calling 'an underwear chart.' White means you have nothing to worry about. Brown means we're in trouble. Much easier and just as effective, I think.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's a story that won't go away. Congressman Joe Wilson has refused Democrats' demand to apologize to Congress on the House floor, to which Kanye West said, 'I'll do it. That's okay, I'll do it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wait, have you heard about this? Oh, I love this. They have new House rules....saying members of Congress cannot call the President a liar. They cannot call him a hypocrite. They cannot say he is dishonest. Today, President Bush said, 'Hey, where were these rules when I was President?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, if they start banning hypocrites and liars from the floor of Congress, there won't be anybody in the building.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Osama bin Laden has released yet another new audiotape. See, they're audiotapes. I don't think he quite gets the Twitter thing. He can't -- he doesn't have the opposable thumb, I guess.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, listen to this. Here's some...good terrorist gossip. According to a Sudanese novelist who once lived with Osama bin Laden for four months,&quot; Osama bin Laden &quot;is a huge Whitney Houston fan...which is surprising. I mean, considering the way those people treat women, you'd think he'd be a bigger Bobby Brown fan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a year after the economy collapsed, Goldman Sachs executives gave each other over $11 billion in bonuses. ... See, what gets me, whenever these Wall Street guys get these huge bonuses they always spend it on something useless, like Senator Chris Dodd. Buy a boat! Get a car.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They always do this when there's a holiday, whenever people want something. The latest rumor is there may be a pumpkin shortage this year. ...They say a chilly, damp summer in the Midwest and Northeast has hurt the pumpkin crop. They say large pumpkins are going to be hard to find. Isn't that unbelievable? I mean, our pumpkins are getting smaller and thinner, and our trick-or-treaters are getting bigger and fatter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in honor of gay marriage now being legal in the state of Vermont, Ben &amp; Jerry's is now selling 'Hubby Hubby' ice cream. You know, if you want to name an ice cream after gay marriage, why not just call it 'Ben &amp; Jerry's?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kanye West continues to be the big story these days. ... President Obama yesterday created quite a stir, because he apparently called Kanye West a 'jackass.' ... Well, some people are upset with President Obama for calling Kanye a 'jackass.' .... And Joe Biden is furious, because 'Jackass' is his Secret Service codename.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Connecticut -- this is weird -- one of the Republican candidates running for Congress is the former CEO of the WWE wrestling organization....which could be good. Congressmen will be less likely to scream out, 'You lie!' if they could get hit with a folding chair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, former President Jimmy Carter said that Congressman Joe Wilson's outburst during President Obama's speech last week was based on racism. When Joe Wilson heard that, he said, 'I can't get mad at Jimmy Carter. He's white.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Joe Wilson is now the only United States congressman to be formally rebuked for speaking out while the President was giving an address. That could explain his Secret Service codename, 'Kanye.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember Joe Wilson? Republican, South Carolina, has truth Tourette's. Six days ago, he shouted, 'You lie!' at President Obama. Caused a bit of a stir.&quot; Wilson has &quot;refused to apologize from the House floor, leaving House Democrats no choice but to rebuke the South Carolina congressman with a formal resolution of disapproval. ... How's a guy recover from that? That's almost as bad as an article of I'm disappointed in you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can imagine how much it hurts when you're disapproved of by people you have absolutely no respect for.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, he says the recession is over. You know, where is that you 'Lie guy!' when you need him?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, they used to say a recession was when your neighbor lost his job, and a depression was when you lost your job. You probably heard this, right? See, now, a recession is when Wall Street guys get bailed out, and a depression is what you get thinking about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Max Baucus has unveiled his healthcare reform bill. It will require that every single American obtain health insurance. Well, let's hope it works out as well as that California law that says that everybody has to have car insurance. Okay, what happened to that one?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and of course, there's that big scandal with APORN, I mean ACORN. ... They're an organization that gets government money to help poor people. Well, now, they're in a lot of trouble. It seems these two filmmakers went to ACORN's office posing as a pimp and a prostitute, saying they wanted to buy a house and run it as a brothel. And ACORN workers gave them advice on how to get away with prostitution and how to avoid paying taxes. See, here's my question. If they want to get away with prostitution and not paying taxes, go to Congress. These are the professionals. These are the people that know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Jennifer Lopez was at the White House. And she got a private tour of the Oval Office. ... So, for once, the biggest ass at the White House wasn't Joe Biden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big story. Earlier today, President Obama said that he's dropping President Bush's plan for a missile defense shield. ... Obama is also dropping President Bush's plan to build an elite army of Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Senate just passed a bill allowing Amtrak passengers to carry guns in their checked luggage. ... However, folks, Greyhound passengers are still not allowed to carry deodorant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, what else is going on? Former Vice President Dick Cheney underwent minor surgery on his back. ... The doctor told Cheney it's a simple operation, he'd be up and having heart surgery in no time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dick Cheney is having surgery today to relieve his lower back pain. And do you know how they administered the anesthesia? They just shot it right in his face.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new Nielsen survey found that Washington, DC, has the most 25 to 34-year-olds in the country who make over $100,000 a year. Yeah, and they're called hookers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vince McMahon's wife, Linda, is stepping down as the CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment to run for the Senate in Connecticut. Things are going well for her. She's already raised a ton of campaign money from the folding chair industry.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, anybody catch this? I'm watching the news last night.

Well, one of the farmers tells the journalist he knows it's a dangerous drug, and it's bad, and it's evil, but if he doesn't grow poppies, his family will starve to death. I've got an idea.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in my home state of Massachusetts, state Republicans are upset over a new tax hike on dogs. ... It was slipped into a bill by Democrats at the last minute. Democrats claim, though, they're only going to be taxing dogs that make over $250,000 a year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new study just released, famed Viennese composer Mozart...died in 1791 from the strep throat. Really? It took 218 years to reach this diagnosis, huh? You think our healthcare sucks?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, the good news, I just hope this gives the Mozart family some closure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And doctors are still arguing over whether being fat should be classified as a medical disease. You know, I think it should be. It should be. Because this time, or the next time rather, your wife says, 'Do these jeans make me look fat?' you can go, 'Honey, I am not a doctor.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Jennifer garner is here tonight. ... She has a new movie out...called 'The Invention of Lying.' I think it's the John Edwards story, if I'm not mistaken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, more problems for Democratic sleazeball John Edwards. The campaign official who claimed he fathered the child of Edwards' mistress is now writing a book where he says Edwards is the real father. And to make matters worse, it turns out ACORN already registered the baby to vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At last night's Dallas Cowboys game, President Bush was spotted sitting next to John Madden. Well, actually, a lot of people were spotted sitting next to John Madden. Large man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of former President Bush, according to a new book that's coming out, former President Bush secretly supports gay marriage. ... Bush said, 'If Bert and Ernie can make it work, anyone can.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, there's a new book coming out about former President Clinton. And it claims that...when Boris Yeltsin was visiting, Yeltsin got drunk and was found wandering Pennsylvania Avenue in his underwear looking for pizza. ... The book also claims that when Clinton wanders around in his underwear, he's not looking for pizza.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some unfortunate news about California. ... A new study shows that California has the dirtiest tap water in the country. ... California officials insist that the dirty water is fine as long as you chew it thoroughly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been reported that Jerry Springer's talk show has suffered a big ratings drop from last year. ... Experts say Springer may have alienated Middle America with his controversial show, 'My Daughter Eats Healthy and Exercises.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Iran President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is coming to New York to address the United Nations, but many restaurants say they won't serve him. ... You can tell which ones because their signs read, 'No shirt, no shoes, no Holocaust, no service.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A big show last night, right here on CBS. The annual Emmy Awards television broadcast. ... What a show that was. My God, I thought we outlawed torture!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm happy to say that once again, 'The Late Show,' we were nominated this year, in an unusual category. We were right between Governor Sanford's meltdown and the 'You lie!' guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you noticed people are rude now? I mean, that guy just screaming out like that. Listen to this. This is how rude people are in Arizona. People keep ringing John McCain's doorbell and then running away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, the Emmys was the only Sunday television program that President Obama was not on yesterday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is on our program tonight. ... I'm in a great mood because the President is here tonight. I underwent three hours of frisking. Whooo!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't kid yourselves, ladies and gentlemen. It's seamless but security here tonight at the Ed Sullivan Theater is very tight. ... They even checked under my hairpiece.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Security is tighter than Joan Rivers' face.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But, and I think this is a relief to all of us, the building has been cleared now of all Republican congressmen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, when you have a big show like this, everybody gets kind of excited about it. And I was talking to my mom today. I said, 'You know, President Obama is on the show tonight.' And she said, 'Well, maybe I'll switch from Conan.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Great to see President Obama again. Haven't seen him since he invited me and Sarah Palin to the White House for a beer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President is here. He's speaking to the UN. And also, the President is in town to pardon Ernie Anastos.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were never able to get President Bush on the show when he was president. ... President Bush was always too busy not working so he couldn't come...through here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of President Bush, did you see him last night at the big football game? It was the Giants and Cowboys down there in Texas. And President Bush did the coin toss at the start of the game. Now here's a bit of trivia. The coin that they used to start the game...was the same coin that the Supreme Court tossed that won Bush the election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big news this weekend. ... President Obama was everywhere. He became the first president to appear on five Sunday morning talk shows. Five talk shows in one day. Even Heidi and Spencer were like, 'Tone it down!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Five, that's a record. Though, he still hasn't topped Bush's record of watching ten straight Saturday morning cartoons.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A woman from Alabama won a dinner with Sarah Palin on eBay. ... It cost $63,000. Palin says she'll take the woman out to a restaurant of her choice and leave after the appetizers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a new study. There's a news study practically every day, but this one found that obese people ? the fat -- have 8% less brain matter...which means&quot; that &quot;overweight people aren't as smart as thin people. Well no wonder the Olsen twins have so much money. They're geniuses.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today's the first day of autumn...although Sarah Palin said today the dying leaves are because of Obama's healthcare plan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, I'm getting kind of worried about President Obama. He hasn't been on a TV show for almost than 11 hours. Is everything all right? Is he okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, you might have noticed, the fall season, begun a little different this year. Even squirrels are kind of distancing themselves from ACORN. Have you noticed that?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know what's interesting? Because of all these...scandals, the executive director of ACORN, a woman named Bertha Lewis, said ACORN will fire any employees 'too stupid to understand...they are not reaching professional standards.' Why can't we get this rule for Congress?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You probably heard this on the news today. There are new security alerts issued to law enforcement agencies all across the country, because al Qaeda is planning to attack vital economic centers. Well, good luck trying to find one of those. ... Luckily, Wall Street took care of them about a year ago, so we are safe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama has angered Eastern Europe after dropping the US missile defense system in the area over there; although President Obama says he hasn't abandoned them. He says in the event they do get hit by nuclear attack, they will be covered by his healthcare plan. So, that is nice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, did you see Obama the last couple of -- he was on six different TV shows pitching his healthcare plan. You know the difference between Obama and the ShamWow guy? You can see the ShamWow guy on Fox.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, more problems for Democratic sleazeball, John Edwards. The campaign official who claims he fathered the child of Edwards' mistress is writing a book where he says Edwards is the real father. So, looks like USC wasn't the only one playing with bad Trojans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, according...to 'The New York Times,' a man named Andrew Young, who is a friend of Edwards, has submitted this book proposal where he reveals John Edwards is the father of the child he had with his mistress, Rielle Hunter. We have a copy of the book right here. It's called 'Duh.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And how awful is this? This book claims that John Edwards tried to calm his mistress down by promising to marry her, after his wife died, in a rooftop wedding ceremony in New York with the Dave Matthews Band as their wedding band. ... Really, Dave Matthews at the wedding for these two? Wouldn't Cheap Trick be more appropriate?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to 'The Los Angeles Times,' the immigrant population in California actually declined last year. When asked if they had noticed, 80% of the people in California said, 'Si.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, President Obama spoke at the UN Climate change summit. And he promised to get greenhouse gas emissions back to the level they were at in 1990. ... And just to show you he's serious to get back to 1990 Obama gave the whole speech dressed as Kid from Kid 'n Play.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Chrysler just announced that it will no longer put owner's manuals in their cars. ... Not only that, Chrysler has pretty much given up on putting owners in their cars.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today's a big day. The MacArthur Foundation gave out its annual 'genius' awards. ... This year's awards went to a journalist, a mental health scientist, and a couple who sold their house three years ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Web Exclusive: Top Ten Reasons President Obama Agreed To Appear on the &quot;Late Show&quot;:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. Heard the lady with the heart-shaped potato was going to be here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Thought it would be fun to watch someone else get heckled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Has something to do with that whole 'Cash for Clunkers' thing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Every president since Teddy Roosevelt has been here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. In this economy, someone offers you $600, you take it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. We told him Megan Fox would be here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Needed a place to hang out until check-in time at his hotel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Honestly, I have no idea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Said, 'Yes' without thinking... Like Bush did with Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Wanted to congratulate Dave on the big Emmy win.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm very excited about the show. I hope you folks are as well because, I'll tell you what, former President Bill Clinton is on the show tonight. Going to be great. Two old guys talking about their bypasses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bill Clinton is here for a very important reason. He heard that CBS had an opening in the 10:00 p.m. slot. Wants to be right there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who was here last night? President Barack Obama was here last night. Politics notwithstanding, what a graceful guy. I mean, after the show, he was nice enough to autograph my swine flu mask.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's opening week at the UN, ladies and gentlemen. ... Security is very tight here in New York City. A lot of dictators all over the city. You know what I've noticed? ... Dictators tend to be tiny. Have you noticed this? Kim Jong Il, a tiny little guy. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Another guy like this: Mayor Bloomberg.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mahmoud Ahmadinejad kicked things off with a hate-filled rant, followed by hors d'oeuvres.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ahmadinejad, quite a speech, that guy. I mean, where is Joe Wilson when you need him, for God's sakes?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This sure should be very exciting at the UN General Assembly. It's being hosted by Neil Patrick Harris.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you wanted to, you could get on the eBay...and you could bid on having dinner with Sarah Palin. Did you know that? Yep, you could bid on it. And the winning bid was $63,000. ... You get to sit down and have dinner. Of course, you know, for that price -- people say that's...a lot of money ? she'll shoot the main course.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's the most expensive date with a governor since Elliott Spitzer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's a lot of money. But you can sit down with Sarah Palin, spend a couple hours; really get to know her. You know, it's the thing John McCain should have done a year ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last week, Dick Cheney had buck surgery. You know Dick Cheney? Dick 'Shotgun' Cheney? You know, it's the complications from carrying Bush for eight years. That's what it was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Doctors are optimistic about the surgery. They said Cheney's back surgery was...quite risky but not necessary. Risky but not necessary. So it's like the Iraq war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see President Obama on 'Letterman' last night? ... It was very funny. I especially liked the segment, 'Stupid Biden Tricks.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a bit awkward, though, when Paul Schaefer...shouted, 'You lie!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today in New York City, it's the fifth annual meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative. It's a very big political event where Bill Clinton gets to spend time with government officials he rarely sees, like Hillary, for example.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I'm thinking, is New York City...the right place for this event? I mean, you're surrounded by hookers, and fast food wrappers, and the smell of pee pee. And that's just Clinton's hotel room.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know that traffic is insane out there. ... It's because of...the United Nations climate week. And over 150 world leaders are here, including President Obama. It's good to see all these guys get in their separate cars, commuting back and forth to the UN, to discuss ways to improve our climate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over 150 world leaders in town for the conference. As a result, there's also 150 mistresses in town. So it's...just a traffic nightmare.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Several heads of state are staying at the Ritz-Carlton over on 59th. ... Most check in under an alias for security reasons, although I'm pretty sure that I know who Joe Schmiden is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Also in New York is Bill Clinton, who's hosting his own Clinton Global Initiative...over at the Sheraton Hotel. It's room 319. Knock three times, ladies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama did interviews on five morning shows on Sunday, and then appeared on 'Letterman' last night. And today, Joe Biden taped an episode of 'Cash Cab.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In his first eight months in office, President Obama has made four times as many TV appearances as President Bush. Of course, Bush hated to be on any TV show that didn't have a 'Showcase Showdown.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US government is giving American Indian tribes $224 million of stimulus money to help fight crime on reservations. The tribes say that they're grateful for the money and plan to bet it all on black.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama has been working hard to push his healthcare proposal. Obama still wants the bill to be bipartisan, but he's a realist, and given the near unanimous Republican opposition he's facing, now says he'd be satisfied if the bill was just bicurious.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President has been making a lot of television appearances. On Sunday, he did all five morning news shows, which they say is a record for a president, and last night he was on with David Letterman. ... The President has been on so many shows lately, even Ryan Seacrest was like, 'Dude, slow down.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Late last night, Obama was also on the Maury Povich show. Good news, turns out he's not the father. John Edwards is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a report going around that John Edwards is getting ready to admit that he did father a child with that woman he had an affair with during his presidential campaign. According to 'The LA Times,' one of his aides wrote a book proposal in which he claims Edwards convinced him to come forward and say he was the father of the child, which the guy did, even though he was married. ... Honestly...we should make this guy president. If he can convince a man to say he fathered a child he didn't, he could convince anybody to do anything, right? 'Come on, China, keep lending us money. We're good for it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is all just speculation, you know. We don't know any of this actually happened and we won't be certain that the baby belongs to John Edwards until we see how the child's hair responds to blow drying.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is one man...who outdid all of us on Sunday -- President. Barack Obama. Looking to further sell his plans for healthcare reform, he visited five separate Sunday morning news rooms. ... Being on five Sunday morning news shows doesn't risk overexposure. The overwhelming majority of Americans at that time are either in church or sleeping off something they should be in church for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think those five shows have a combined viewership of 10 million, with an average viewer age of around, 10 million.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So if Obama's overexposed, Ryan Seacrest and Tom Bergeron are translucent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President is not an action figure. We live in a democracy, not a Star Wars convention. When you take the president out of its package and play with it, it doesn't lose value.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, there's even an inside the Beltway name for the technique of all-out media exposure. ... The 'Full Ginsburg.' Coincidentally,&quot; that is &quot;also the least athletic move currently allowed in competitive ice skating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Also over the weekend, members of the Republican base gathered in Washington, DC, for the Values Voter Summit. It's an annual event where social conservatives can network, condemn society's godlessness, and decide which candidate will come in third&quot; in the &quot;next Republican primaries. By the way, congratulations Mike Huckabee.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On the agenda, a chance to honor one of their own, as Bill O'Reilly accepted an award in a ceremony that the media were barred from covering, which really would not have been...such a big deal, except that he was accepting the -- let me see if I have this right -- the Media Courage Award!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama was on five shows this Sunday morning. Sounds like somebody hates church.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you all for coming out on such a hot day. What was it, 104? ... It was so hot today, John Edwards promised his mistress he would marry her on top of an igloo with Ice Cube playing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know this whole story about this ACORN organization? This is a community outreach program. It was partially funded by the government, and...it was supposed to help poor people, encourage them to vote, things like this. Anyway, it seems an undercover camera crew, posing as a pimp and a prostitute, videotaped ACORN workers explaining how to falsify documents in order to get loans to run their prostitution business. And as result, Congress cut off their funding. ... See, that's the risk you run, whether you're dealing with politicians or prostitutes. Sooner or later, somebody's going to get screwed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, while we're at it, maybe Congress could put off taxpayer money going to those other organizations with unethical employees, like AIG, Goldman Sachs, Citibank, Bank of America...&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Barack Obama addressed the UN General Assembly today. His opening line was, 'Some of you may recognize me from my appearances on television.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, in his first eight months in office, President Obama has made four times as many TV appearances as President Bush. Experts say if Obama continues at this rate, next week he will eclipse Regis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Iranian leader Mahmoud I'm-a-nut-job, he's in New York this week. Boy, he's really grumpy. ... I guess the movie on the flight over from Iran was 'Schindler's List.' ... And he...just didn't like that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Libyan leader Moammar Kadafi-duck, this moron, was at the UN today. ... He talked forever. He talked on Israel and the swine flu and the JFK assassination. Where was Kanye West to grab the microphone away?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He talked so long, even Joe Biden went, 'Enough!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this terror stuff is back in the news. Earlier today, the feds issued a new terror alert. They said terrorists are looking at hitting successful entertainment center, so you folks at NBC are perfectly safe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, I'm sure you heard about this story. Officials have charged three men born in Afghanistan in this terror probe. An official says much of the evidence gathered was suggestive of a plot to attack buses or trains. How scary is that? Imagine terrorists being able to blow up an Amtrak train before it has a chance to run off the embankment on its own.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And they said if a bomb went off in the LA subway system, it could affect up to three people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, this terror suspect who was arrested in Colorado that was charged with detailed plans on how to make the bomb ? here's my favorite part. The guy said he downloaded the plans to make the bomb off the Internet by mistake.... Oh, shut ? that's the porn excuse! Wives don't even buy that! Shut up!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to a front page story in the 'LA Times,' the CIA is deploying teams of spies, analysts, and paramilitary operatives to Afghanistan as part of a broad intelligence search. They said this should catch the Taliban by surprise, unless, of course, they happen to see the front page of the 'LA Times.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you see this? A dinner with Sarah Palin just sold on eBay for $64,000. Meanwhile, John McCain got the prime rib and baked potato for only $4.99 at Caro's.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Sarah Palin gave a speech today in Hong Kong. She was very tough on President Obama. She attacked President Obama on foreign soil. Well, I'm sure the people that went after the Dixie Chicks will be going after her right now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some good gossip. There's a new book out about Barack and Michelle Obama's marriage. And in it, they say that Michelle Obama was very upset by all these drooling blonds...who would push up to her husband and rub themselves up against him. ... They said this...one blonde was especially suggestive and kept rubbing up against the President. And finally, Michelle said, 'Look, Chris Matthews, get away from my husband.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Moammar Gadhafi was at the UN today. ... He gave a speech that was extremely long. It was rambling and filled with inappropriate comments. ... As soon as Gadhafi finished, Joe Biden came up and said, 'Teach me, master.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When President Obama addressed the UN General Assembly today, Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi applauded for him, but Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad refused to applaud. ... But folks, the big surprise was when Kim Jong-Il started the wave. That was the crazy part.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear what former President Bill Clinton said? In a new book that's coming out, former President Bill Clinton said he had an affair with Monica Lewinsky because he, quote, 'cracked under pressure.' ... When asked what he's doing this weekend, Clinton replied, 'Cracking under pressure.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, today former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin gave a speech in China. ... The topic of her speech was, 'Are you sure you're not Japan?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a new interview, conservative talk show host Glenn Beck called John McCain a 'weird progressive, like Teddy Roosevelt.' ... In response, McCain said, 'That's funny. That's what Teddy used to call me.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, be honest, ladies and gentlemen. How many of you are here because you couldn't get into the UN?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now this was momentous. Yesterday, President Obama brought together Israeli and Palestinian leaders, and undeniably now, it was awkward. And they stood there, and they stared at each other, and finally, after an uncomfortable period of time, they shook hands. It was like my wedding night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then the Iranian dictator Mahmoud Ahmadinejad gave a hate speech and I thought to myself, where's that 'you lie' guy when you need him?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is talking there, and halfway through the speech, people got angry. Got angry, fed up, full of disdain and rage, and they started to march out of the ? no. No, that was last night's audience.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But if I could now, in all seriousness, I'd like to say a couple of words about Ahmadinejad. Short and ugly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know the big surprise, Osama bin Laden was supposed to address the UN but he dropped out at the last minute because of mercury poisoning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, listen to this. You know the former governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin? Boy, I know her. She's traveling all over the world now, speaking gigs. And she went to Hong Kong and gave a speech and people who heard the speech said it was articulate, it was well prepared it was compelling. It's a year late, but...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And if it was that good I'm thinking it must have been Tina Fey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They paid her $300,000 for the speech, the Chinese, $300,000 for the speech. I guess she apparently could see the cash from her house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, President Obama met with Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama, or as President Bush called him, 'Mr. Miyagi.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Japanese prime minister wanted to thank Obama for all of the money that Japan got from the 'Cash for Clunkers' program.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But tomorrow, President Obama will be the first president to chair the UN Security Council. That's pretty cool. Meanwhile, Joe Biden became the first vice president to spend six hours in a Brookstone massage chair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Obama's have been very busy. Tonight, they hosted an evening reception for world leaders at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York. ... The party was going great until Hugo Chavez started doing karaoke.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a speech to the Clinton Global Initiative yesterday, President Obama thanked Bill Clinton for the extraordinary difference he has made since leaving the White House. Clinton then stood up and thanked President Obama for keeping Hillary so busy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Joe Biden spoke at a retirement home in Maryland today to reassure senior citizens about healthcare reform. The seniors didn't really care what Biden said in the speech, they were just happy to outlive it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Libya's President Moammar Gadhafi gave a lengthy tirade to the UN General Assembly today. He was supposed to talk for 15 minutes but went on a 90-minute rant instead. I mean, where is Kanye when you need him?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A pharmaceutical company is developing a micro chip to be implanted in patients' shoulders that remind them to take their medication. That's just what crazy people on drugs need, right, a voice talking to them out of their shoulder?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I read this in 'Time' magazine. Former presidential candidate Ralph Nader said that President Obama was 'weak, waffling and wavering.' And then Nader added, 'I do not like him in a house. I do not like him with a mouse.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Federal authorities have issued a flurry of bulletins warning that sports stadiums, entertainment complexes, hotels, motels, apartment buildings, and transit systems could be targets of terrorist attacks. Well thanks for narrowing it down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, you know the safest place to be now? Airplanes. ... Stay in the air as long as you can.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to the FBI, terrorists may be targeting sporting events here in the United States and people attending games are being told keep an eye out for anybody looking suspicious or anybody who looks like they might be a threat. Well, what do you do at an Oakland Raiders game? That's everybody.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and that Colorado man that's arrested for lying to the FBI and having links to al Qaeda, well, they got him on an additional charge. Planning to use weapons of mass destruction. He reportedly purchased bomb-making ingredients from a beauty supply store. ... Did you hear his defense today? He said, 'Don't hate me because I'm beautiful.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday at the United Nations, president Barack Obama told the world, 'Don't expect America to fix all your problems.' Hey, hey, what happened to 'Yes we can?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know about Gadhafi living in his tent? You know this whole wacky story? After residents complained, Gadhafi had to dismantle his tent he was living in outside of New York City, in Bedford, New York. You know, say what you want about Gadhafi, but don't you wish your relatives, when they came, would...stay in a tent on the front lawn?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin gave a speech to a conference of investors in Hong Kong yesterday morning. Then she spent the afternoon shooting pandas from a helicopter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to the latest rumors, the former CEO of eBay, Meg Whitman, about to announce she is running for governor of California. See, that shows you how bad the economy is getting here in California. Now we're just another piece of crap on eBay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While he's in New York for the UN conference, Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi is traveling with an entourage of 50 attractive female bodyguards. ... The guards are there in case Gadhafi gets attacked or in case he wants to make a music video from 1985.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Obama made a big speech. He welcomed the members of the UN General Assembly to New York, and he said, 'I'd like to encourage you to do some shopping while you're here.' I think it worked because China immediately bought eight banks, two car companies, and the state of Wyoming.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to 'The New York Times,' Manuel Zelaya,&quot; the &quot;recently deposed president of Honduras, he's holed up with supporters who don't bathe, eat only rice and beans and one guy who hasn't changed his Che Guevara t-shirt in days. ... So apparently, Manuel Zelaya is holed up in my freshman dorm room.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Health officials are now saying that the swine flu could be spread at college keg parties. ... They say if you attend a keg party and come home feeling numb and vomiting profusely, you're probably fine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, Chrysler announced it's replacing its owners' manuals with a DVD. ... In a related story, most Americans have replaced their Chrysler with a Toyota.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the Los Angeles City Council has passed a new law that limits people in Los Angeles to one rooster per household. ... That's what I love about this town. You can have 50 illegal immigrants in the House, just one rooster.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm trying to put a good face on things and I appreciate you folks trying the same thing but it's tough. ... They say, 'Oh, the economy's getting better.' Really? 'Oh, the recession's almost over.' Really? Well, it still seems pretty bad and as a matter of fact a lot of senior citizens, this is how sad it is, are having to go back to work now. ... Although there is a bright side. For example up in Minnesota, the Vikings got a quarterback out of the deal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know it was fun at the beginning of the week when we had all of the world leaders here in New York City visiting the UN for the big grand opening of the UN. It was fun for a while but now we are sick of them and want them to go home. Traffic is insane. You can't get anywhere. And Gadhafi with that stretch camel, who's he kidding?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But President Obama, God bless the guy, has been very busy. Yesterday, he actually headed up a meeting of the UN Security Council. Meanwhile, in Arizona, John McCain called a waitress 'toots.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear President Obama's speech about nuclear proliferation? ... It was impressive. It's nice to have a president who can pronounce nuclear, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then they had the madman hour yesterday afternoon. And it was Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and he gave a speech to the UN. He said he hated the US, said he hated Israel, and he hated that dumb pedestrian mall on Broadway. But...Ahmadinejad did say if Iran is given access to uranium, he promises not to make weapons. And I said, 'Well, that's good enough for me.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi also spoke at the UN. Very exciting. This guy, for some reason, is getting very popular. ... As a matter of fact, this weekend, he's going to be the musical guest on 'Saturday Night Live.' And did you see the pictures of the tent in Trump's backyard? ... The tent is an ingenious design. ... It's supported by a rather intricate architectural...network and foundation of fiberglass poles. It's the same thing that supports the deal on Donald Trump's head.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's fall here in New York. It's cool, getting dark earlier. The temperature's dropping. The leaves are changing. In fact, the only thing that hasn't changed is Gadhafi is still talking at the UN.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Gadhafi's rant yesterday, Gadhafi referred to President Obama as his son. Then he went on to describe Joe Biden as his weird, talkative cousin.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see this idiot, Moammar Gadhafi, speak at the UN? What a hypocrite this guy is, standing there, putting down Western culture, yet he's swearing a Snuggie.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's chilly here in New York City. As a matter of fact today, it was chillier than a conversation between President Obama and Governor Paterson.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apparently what happened, Governor Paterson gets a call from President Obama, and President Obama says, 'Hey, uh, don't run.' A lot of tension between these two guys; as a matter of fact, now, it looks like Paterson may have to invite himself to the White House for a beer.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what's exciting about this time of year, ladies and gentlemen? The new fall television season, huh? Yeah!

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The restaurant also created a new sandwich named after Joe Biden. It's just a hamburger shaped like a foot.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the FBI has arrested a suspected al Qaeda terrorist and his dad. Did you hear about this? This guy was plotting terrorist attacks with his father. Even Mackenzie Phillips is going, 'Ooh! That's bad.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, it seems one of these terror suspects gave himself away when he bought...an unusually high quantity of hydrogen peroxide at a beauty supply store. Peroxide is used in explosives and also used, you know, for hair highlights. The guy tried to avoid suspicion as a man buying tons of highlights by giving the name Ryan Seacrest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, he got caught because of the shampoo he bought. It was this ? 'Jihad, Your Hair Smells Terrific.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about fantasy football? Detroit Lions won. ... Detroit Lions beat the Washington Redskins 19-14, snapping their 19-game losing streak. ... Do you believe that? Detroit owning Washington. There's a change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because of a nationwide shortage of ammunition, some Wal-Marts have put a limit on the number of bullets a customer can buy per visit. ... Yeah, which is great because if there's one Wal-Mart customer you want to piss off, it's the guy that buys bullets. That's the one to alienate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today's Yom Kippur and what that means is down in Houston earlier today...former President George W. Bush got up early and started looking for Easter eggs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You could sure tell it's fall. ... Today, Iran was making enriched cider.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You heard about this? Yesterday, Iran fires a missile. ... Not only that, but Iran is now testing a talk show at 10:00 p.m.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's a story. And it's about time. Director Roman Polanski, they finally get this guy. They arrest him in Switzerland. ... And I was thinking well, you know, great, I'm glad they got Polanski but what about bin Laden?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin went to Hong Kong, delivered a speech last week. And we're learning more and more about the speech that she delivered there. Palin...says China needs to deal with its ethics problems. Well, I bet that got a nice laugh.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She was paid $300,000 to go over there and speak in Hong Kong. Apparently she could see the money from her house.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was reading today about President Obama's new...plans for education. I guess President Obama wants kids to spend more time in school. He wants them staying later in the day. That's not new. We had that when I was in school. It's called detention. I was there until 5:30, 6:00 every night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And officials from the US, Great Britain, and France are demanding that Iran disclose all of its nuclear efforts after it was revealed that Iran had this secret nuclear facility. ... These Iranians, very clever at disguising it. They made sure nobody could find this place. They made the outside of it look just like a movie theater showing that new Megan Fox film.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the 'New York Daily News' is reporting that John Edwards' former aide, Andrew Young, is now saying Edwards had affairs with many other women on the campaign trail. ... This sounds like the same trail Governor Mark Sanford was supposed to be hiking on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To give you an idea how much Edwards was fooling around, it turns out half the babies he kissed on the campaign trail were his.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Honda, very inventive company. Honda, very clever people. They've come out with a battery-powered motorized unicycle for senior citizens. ... Or you could save your money and just throw Grandma down the cellar stairs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last week -- you might have seen this -- Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was interviewed by Larry King. ... Ahmadinejad told Larry that Iran's nuclear program is only for peaceful uses. And Larry came back with, 'Who's your favorite Jonas brother?' It was a good interview. It was Nick. He likes Nick.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Sarah Palin Tips For Writing A Book:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. Close curtains so you don't get distracted by Russia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Increase vocabulary ? use words like 'Slanket.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. First buy yourself 100-grand worth of writing outfits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Don't write a word until the check clears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Limit yourself to one 'you betcha' per chapter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. You can never have enough stories about ice fishing or killing things with your bare hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. When in doubt, just type (wink).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Don't let writing cut into attending 'Fire Letterman' rallies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Have the book translated for sale to European countries like London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. 'I'll try to find ya some tips and I'll bring 'em to ya!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The former governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin, has completed her memoir, and it'll be in stores in November. So that's something to look forward to. ... A lot of people aren't taking her seriously. I've seen it. It's a big, huge...book. But when you go into the store, you can use that big book to step up so you can reach a better book.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The book will be out this November. Coincidentally, she was out last November.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's called 'Going Rogue.' ... Not to be confused with John McCain's new memoir, 'Going Several Times A Night.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I saw a pack of skunks coming down Broadway earlier today, and I said to myself, 'Great, where is Dick Cheney when you need him?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what happened one year ago today? The stock market dropped 700 points. One year ago today. Do you have any idea what that means? Neither do I.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's interesting now. A lot of people say, they're bragging, 'I didn't lose any money. I'm smarter than that. I didn't lose any money.' For example, Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska, did not lose a penny when the stock market tanked. ... You know why? She has all her money in pelts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Chicago, Illinois, wants the Olympics in 2016. ... Everybody is pitching in. Remember former Governor Rod Blagojevich? ... Even he's pitching in. He said if they send the Olympics to Chicago, he will throw in a US Senate seat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama says he will use all of his powers of persuasion to get the Olympics in Chicago. I thought, well, great. It's worked pretty well so far with his healthcare plan. Good luck there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you folks remember Andy Williams? Fantastic singer. ... He says that President Obama is 'following Marxist theory.' ... I said, 'That's interesting. I think I'm going to wait and see what the Andrews Sisters say.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the best news I've heard in a long time. The CIA announced a brand new plan to capture Osama bin Laden. ... They're going to invite him to Zurich, Switzerland, to have him pick up a lifetime achievement award.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The publishers of Sarah Palin's upcoming memoir&quot; have &quot;given it a title. It's going to be called 'Going Rogue.' John McCain's memoir is coming out as well. It will be called 'Going Pee.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big healthcare news. This just happened. The public option backed by President Obama was just voted down by the Senate Finance Committee, or as supporters of universal healthcare call them, 'The Death Panel.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The final tally was eight voted 'yes,' 15 voted 'you lie!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I read about this today, too. Sarah Palin's 400-page memoir&quot; is going to be released &quot;on November 17th, and it's called 'Going Rogue: An American Life.' And critics say that it starts out okay, it get's really exciting and then confusing, and then the last 100 pages are blank.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The book costs $24.99, but it has a $5,000 jacket.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President of the World Bank said yesterday that the euro could replace the American dollar as the new global currency. The Treasury Department is telling everyone to not panic, just calmly throw your money away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin has a new book coming out. They say she finished the book ahead of schedule so they moved the release date up to November 17th. So, turns out she can finish something.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The title of the book is 'Going Rogue,' which is how some of John McCain's advisers derisively describe what she did during the presidential campaign. The title is getting a mixed reaction. Some people like it, some people don't. And some think 'Going Rogue' is a rip-off of Joe Biden's memoir, 'Going Rogaine,' which came out like five years ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know he's not just the Vice President, he's also a client.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Meanwhile, President Obama has an idea to make our country smarter. He wants to shorten summer vacation and extend the school year. And I don't want to be cynical, but clearly this is a back door deal for the powerful Tater Tot lobby.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I miss our old President, who worked for more recess for children, not more school. Instead, we elected the...kid who reminds the teacher that she forgot to give the class homework. That's no fun at all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, the mainstream media, they've got a reputation for not asking the hard questions. Well last week Charlie Gibson proved that wrong. 'Would it be possible to live for an extended period on the moon?' Wow. It appears he is looking into his retirement options very seriously. Dude, just because you're leaving 'World News' doesn't mean you have to leave Earth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, the healthcare bill is so complicated, I get a headache just thinking about it. And my insurance company says that's a pre-existing condition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't understand why the Democrats are rushing this bill, instead of patiently waiting for the Republicans to take back Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For instance, just last week, the Finance Committee rejected Kentucky Senator Jim Bunning's request that before they vote on the bill, it be 'posted...for 72 hours' on the Internet. That way, we'll know the bill's a failure if it's played off by 'Piano Cat.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well recently, Kansas Senator Pat Roberts explained the real reason we should delay this vote. 'The thing I'm trying to point out is that we would have at least 72 hours for the people that the providers have hired to keep up with all of the legislation that we pass around here, and the regulations we pass around here, to say, 'Hey, wait a minute. Have you considered this?' See! All he wants is some time for healthcare lobbyists to change the bill.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, if you saw '60 Minutes,' you probably saw this. President Obama coming under fire, because he has only spoken to the US commander in Afghanistan once in the last six months. Well, whose fault is that? Hey, if the general wants to talk to President Obama, get a talk show. That's how you do it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, actually, to be fair, I thought this was nice, President Obama said he's been very busy lately, but he would be willing to add the general as a Facebook friend.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Officials have learned that some al Qaeda suicide bombers, in an effort to avoid detection are hiding explosives inside their buttocks. ... Well, this whole thing started because somebody tried to assassinate a Saudi prince last month by detonating an explosive device they had hidden in their rectum. This is real. Luckily, the only person killed was the suicide bomber. But he really had the bomb hidden in his rectum. Here's my question. At what point in the planning of these attacks do they tell the suicide bomber? I mean you got these guys. 'Okay, boss, I'm ready to be a martyr. I'm ready to die for my cause. Where's my dynamite vest?' 'Listen, Khalid, we've made some changes.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me tell you something, the military has taken this bomb in the rectum thing pretty seriously. I understand they are now dropping bran muffins all over Afghanistan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, a new book is coming out -- oh, boy, this is unbelievable -- by John Edwards' campaign official, a guy named Andrew Young. I guess they were quite close friends. Young now says there is sex tape of John Edwards and his mistress. Well, of course, people are stunned by this. ... John Edwards letting someone else get in front of the camera? I don't think so.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I think it is true, because at one point on the tape, at the height of passion, you can hear John Edwards screaming out his own name.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Chris Dodd, who is head of the Senate Banking Committee, is pushing for one super-regulator to oversee all the banks. He said his goal to restore more confidence in the banking system. You know what would restore more confidence in the banking system? If Chris Dodd wasn't head of the Senate Banking Committee.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama and Oprah Winfrey are going to Copenhagen together...this week to push for Chicago to host the 2016 Olympics. ... The bad news is while they're gone the country's going to be run by Joe Biden and Jerry Springer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've got a really strange story in the news about al Qaeda. ... According to intelligence reports ? I'm not making this up -- the new standard procedure for al Qaeda hiding explosives inside their rectum. ... Either that or they're playing a cruel practical joke on Ahmed. 'Are you sure everyone's doing this?' 'Yeah, go ahead, go ahead.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin just finished writing her memoirs. ... And her publisher says -- this is a quote ? 'It's her words, her life and it's all there in full and fascinating detail.' Yeah, then he said, 'Or so I'm told. I wouldn't read this thing if you put a gun in my mouth.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, here's exciting news-- Sarah Palin, her memoir, has been published and is coming out in early November. And I got an advance copy. ... And...this time I was the one who quit halfway through.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People in Alaska are looking forward to Sarah Palin's memoir. They're already calling it 'The Book to Nowhere.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But if you're interested, Sarah Palin will be at Barnes &amp; Noble later this fall for a book shooting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the book has got a lot of...beautiful color photos that Sarah has taken from her front porch -- beautiful pictures of Russia that she took from her front porch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the back -- this is helpful -- a complete index of all my apologies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin's book is entitled 'Going Rogue,'...not to be confused with John McCain's new book 'Going... Where am I going? Where the hell am I going? I don't know where I'm going.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big news was the Senate yesterday -- the finance committee -- rejected the Democrats' healthcare plan, the one with the public option. ... Meanwhile, the Republicans are offering their own healthcare plan. It's called 'Stop Crying and Take an Advil.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If that doesn't pass, they're going to go with 'Swine Flu Fever, Catch It.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nancy Pelosi attended the U2 concert last night in Washington, DC, as Bono's personal guest. She had a great time. The whole night she was on the verge of making an expression.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;U2 even dedicated a song to her face ? 'Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She almost shed a tear. But she doesn't have tear ducts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Michelle Obama told 'Prevention' magazine that at 45 she wants to be in the best shape of her life. Meanwhile, Joe Biden told the magazine that he wants to be in the shape of a unicorn.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's some good news. The US is bringing home more than 4,000 troops from Iraq by the end of October. That's really good. But Joe Wilson thinks the troops should stay 'til 'July!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For years, the Democrats in our Federal government lived in legislative exile, a power Diaspora. But all that changed in 2006 when the Democrats regained control of this nation's House of Representatives and its Senate. And with that control, they still failed to get timelines for Iraq war withdrawals, government-negotiated prescription drug prices; any kind of meaningful environmental legislation. Actually, they really failed to get anything. Basically, the Democrats seem like the kind of people who switch to GEICO and lose money.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new study out of the University of Michigan, during this bad economy, people's health is actually better than it was before. Isn't that amazing? When times are bad economically, people stay in better health, to which former President Bush said, 'You're welcome!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, President Obama announced a plan to spend $5 billion on science and cutting-edge medical research, or, as Fox News calls that, 'socialism.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, actually, experts say this $5 billion project of President Obama's could lead to the development of dozens of life-saving medical treatments that your insurance company could one day turn you down for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is now in Denmark to lobby for Chicago to be awarded the 2016 Summer Olympic Games. ... The head of the IOC, the International Olympic Committee, he says that they will not be swayed by the Obama visit. They said they're going to weigh all the bribes, kickbacks, and secret favors equally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, this week on 'Dancing with the Stars,' former Congressman Tom DeLay almost dropped his partner. ... I guess all those years of lobbyists greasing his palms, apparently he just couldn't...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and the pre-orders for Sarah Palin's new book on Amazon are huge. It's the number one book on Amazon. I was looking for that section where it says, 'People who bought this book also bought 'Bridge to Nowhere.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the publisher was impressed...that Sarah Palin finished the book four months ahead of schedule. That's not a big deal. She finished her term as governor 18 months ahead of schedule.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama, Michelle Obama, and Oprah Winfrey are all in Denmark lobbying for the 2016 Olympics to be in Chicago. ... Apparently, this is the most black people in Denmark since the 1987 Earth, Wind &amp; Fire tour.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Things Overheard At China's Anniversary Celebration:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. 'So Communism is 20 years younger than Cher?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. 'The Beijing Red Roof Inn is the best we could do?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. 'Let's take attendance to make sure all 1.3 billion people are here.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. 'Wow, Regis will attend anything.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. 'Why do I always get stuck sitting behind Yao Ming at these things?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. 'Great! Letterman videotaped a special Top Ten list for us.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. 'Is it me or is the Tiananmen Square cake a little tacky?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. 'And now, President Hu Jintao will be roasted by the one and only Gilbert Gottfried.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. 'Any more of those 'pandas in a blanket' appetizers?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. 'Make sure we're home in time for Leno!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama and his lovely wife Michelle are in Copenhagen and they're making a pitch to bring the 2016 Olympics to Chicago. Barack Obama is...unusual. ... I mean, here the guy is on a business trip, with his wife. I mean, what is that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dick Cheney is all excited about the 2016 Olympics. He's really looking forward to the freestyle waterboarding.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin's new memoir is being published in early November. ... A lot of revelations in the book, but you probably knew this: During the presidential campaign, Sarah had to cut up John McCain's meat for him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is on the road, you guys. His first stop was Geneva, where he held his talks with Iranian diplomats about Iran's nuclear weapons program, or as Iran is saying -- 'What nuclear weapons program?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But now, Obama is in Copenhagen. He's trying to get the Olympics in Chicago, while Iran is getting ready to nuke the world. This could explain Obama's new Secret Service codename, 'President Bush.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin's new autobiography...doesn't come out until November,&quot; but it is &quot;already number one on Amazon. And if you go to the website, it says, 'People who bought this book also bought no other books in their entire life.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, Palin's book is number one on Amazon, it's number one at Barnes and Noble, and it would be on sale at Borders, but she had all of them closed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought this was nice. Out of good sportsmanship, the forward was written by a moose.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday we covered the Democratic Party's failure to get their much-vaunted healthcare reform plan's out of the Senate Finance Committee. ... . Dark days for the Dems but they still haven't played the ace up their sleeve. ... Obama, save the Dems from themselves. 'President Obama, Michelle Obama, and Oprah Winfrey travel across the world to make a bid for Chicago to get the next Olympics.' Huh! They're gone. Wait. Michelle, Barack, and Oprah out of the country. That means, for the time being, Tyler Perry is the most powerful black person in our country. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! The Legislature is now 'Tyler Perry Presents Tyler Perry's House of Representatives.' It's...going to be huge for a week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I thought there was a reason that President Obama wasn't going to Copenhagen to make the case for the Olympics personally. 'I would make the case in Copenhagen personally, if I weren't so firmly committed to...making real the promise of quality affordable healthcare for every American.' Ah! I knew that was the reason. Thanks for reminding me, guy who forgot what he said.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess that's why there's two phones in the Oval Office: One for nuclear war, and one for Oprah. 'Iran has launched what? Wait, hold on. Stedman's wearing what?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, everyone knows I'm a huge fan of the Olympics. ... Every four years, the nations of the world, coming together to battle for supremacy. It's just like war, except the news still covers it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And just like in war, everyone knows the host country has an advantage, which is why I'm pulling for the 2016 Olympics to be held in Chicago. ... We must get the Olympics to Chicago: City of Big Shoulders; Hog Butcher to the World; the Fat Kid at Recess.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Chicago, Illinois! If you can make it there, you can make it in several other midsize cities. For instance, Minneapolis. You could make it in Minneapolis also.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even President Obama is personally going to bat for his hometown, which is a long shot, since Nairobi's not even a finalist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, some naysayers point out that the Olympics are a financial black hole. For instance, Montreal just paid off their Olympic stadium three decades after the '76 games. Of course, that stadium's value kept declining, due to an infestation of Expos.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama has a new slogan. 'Blame it on Rio.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, congratulations to Rio de Janeiro. They won the bid to host the 2016 Olympic Games. You know, President Obama flew to Denmark, made his pitch personally, but the International Olympic Committee voted and Chicago didn't win, which, hey, I can understand that. It's October. Chicago never wins in October.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some nut ball at the San Francisco Airport was arrested the other night at the ticket counter when he held up a cell phone and shouted, 'I'm going to press this and blow up the plane!' Luckily, they didn't have to evacuate or anything. What happened was, a quick-thinking ticket agent could see he had T-Mobile and realized, oh, the call's never gonna go through.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of Americans say the financial crisis and healthcare debate has shown that when push comes to shove -- and I agree with this -- both Republicans and Democrats...always take the side of the corporations who give them the most money. Right? I'm not blaming these guys. Know what we should do? We should make politicians dress like race car drivers. When they get money, make them wear the company's logo on their suit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, big dispute in New York City. Quite a controversy. People lit up the Empire State Building in red and yellow to honor the 60th anniversary of the communist revolution in China. You know, if they want to honor the Chinese, why not just paint the whole building with lead paint? Wouldn't that be a better way?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big Burbank Halloween store just opened. I love going to the Halloween stores. ... Big costume this year, pirates. ... All you need is a brief case, coat and tie,&quot; and &quot;a little Wall Street business card.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, the International Olympic Committee decided the 2016 Olympics are not going to be in Chicago. They're going to be held in Rio de Janeiro. ... As a result, the 2016 Olympics will be topless.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama has banned Federal employees from texting while driving because he says it's distracting and could lead to accidents. ... Obama admitted that he was texting behind the wheel when he picked Joe Biden for Vice President.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The founder of Cirque du Soleil arrived at the International Space Station today, and he's promised to wear a red clown nose and tickle the other astronauts' feet while they're asleep. ... The astronauts sent out the message, 'Houston, we have an a-hole.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, it was reported today, that for the ninth year in a row, the most popular car color is silver. ... In fact, Chrysler says this year, all three of the cars they sold were silver.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Signs You Have Too Much Money: &quot;10. Actually considering plunking down $29 on that Palin book.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Signs You Have Too Much Money: &quot;9. Someone mentions the recession, you say, 'The what?!?!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pretty soon, ladies and gentlemen, the former governor of Alaska, you can read her memoir, Sarah Palin's book. It's called 'Going Rogue.' ... I read it. I was disappointed. Three chapters were devoted to cleaning fish.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Mayor Bloomberg has a copy of the book. He loves it. He says it's the best book he ever sat on. ... Tiny guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin's book is big, 400 pages. She wrote the book herself and agonized over every word, and so will you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And now, ladies and gentlemen, here's a brand new segment for the show. It's called 'Things More Fun Than Reading The Sarah Palin Memoir.' ... 'Number 38: Having your arm ripped off by a shark.' This has been 'Things More Fun Than Reading The Sarah Palin Memoir.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's the 60th anniversary of China. ... And the reason we're celebrating here in the United States is because China owns all our debt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So if you want to send China a present -- the traditional 60th anniversary gift for China -- you know what it is?. ... It's lead paint.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I don't know why, but everybody here in New York City has Chinese sixtieth anniversary fever. It's either that or swine flu.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big news today. The Olympic Committee voted on whether Chicago, Tokyo, Rio, or Madrid would host the 2016 Olympics. I don't know if it was rigged or anything, but the winner was Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, Rio de Janeiro was chosen to host the 2016 Summer Games. The whole city is very excited. The announcement was made at 1:00 today, and they've been celebrating like crazy for 50 years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ken Lewis, the CEO of Bank of America, will receive a $53 million pension when he retires at the end of the year, but he...can only get out of the ATM $20 at a time.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the latest Gallup poll, the group President Obama is most popular with -- you know who it is? ... Obama is most popular with the Jewish community. The group he's least popular with -- International Olympic Committees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, President Obama flew to Denmark, made his pitch. The international committee voted. Chicago finished last, dead last. Well, I guess the committee thought Chicago already had enough amateur athletes with the White Sox and the Cubs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what the mistake was? We shouldn't have sent President Obama over there to get the votes. We should have sent ACORN. It would have been a landslide. We would have gotten all the votes, thousands of votes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what the saddest part is about Chicago not getting the 2016 Olympics? Former Governor Rod Blagojevich already sold ten free seats for 100 grand a piece to the opening ceremony.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was sad to see Chicago lose it. Because they had a great mascot. ... It was Loafy, the 5-pound pork sandwich with legs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, congratulations. The Obamas celebrated their 17th wedding anniversary this past week. The paper said this is the first wedding anniversary Obama is celebrating in the White House. Sadly, it's also the first thing the Obamas have to celebrate since they've been in the White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, at the White House, President Obama met with a group of doctors from every state in the union to press his case for health care reform. It was the biggest gatherings of doctors, I guess, since Dick Cheney had his last staff meeting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, listen to this. According to reports from 'The Daily Telegraph,' Iranian President...Mahmoud Amedinejad is part Jewish. He has Jewish ancestry. ... Well, this is great. You know, he's anti-Semitic. Now he can just kill himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the latest job numbers are out. The bad news is we have the worst unemployment in 26 years. ... The good news, that unemployment also includes Jon from 'Jon &amp; Kate.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Governor Schwarzenegger said if he comes back to California, there should be no special treatment for Roman Polanski. I think that's what he said.&quot; It was that &quot;or...'I'm going to Japan to ski.' I don't know what he said.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Sarah Palin's new book comes out November 17th. ... A lot of people are surprised they paid Sarah Palin to write a book. Hey, they paid Tom DeLay to dance. Why not pay her to write a book?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama celebrated his 17th wedding anniversary. Isn't that nice? ... The President celebrated by going out for a romantic candlelit dinner with just his wife and Oprah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, speaking of presidents, a former speechwriter to President Bush was quoted as saying that, contrary to what people think, Bush 'wasn't dumb.' ... In fact, as we speak, that quote's being engraved on the wall of the Bush Presidential Library.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I will be honest with you, folks. Right now, I would give anything to be hiking on the Appalachian Trail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about this? Over the weekend, they came up with proof that Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is Jewish. ... I wonder how much they wanted to keep that quiet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ahmadinejad won't be talking about it. He's referring all questions to Rubenstein Communications.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, how about this? President Obama goes to Denmark and he's trying to get the 2016 Olympics for the great city of Chicago. And he presented his case in a heartfelt manner but they weren't buying it. And boy, do I know what that feels like.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a great day for America...because&quot; three Americans &quot;were awarded the Nobel prize for medicine today. Take that, Brazil! Brazil got the 2016 Olympics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And starting today, we get the swine flu vaccination. ... Doctors are set to receive the vaccination first, because they're the only ones who can still afford to go see the doctor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the box office this weekend, the movie 'Zombieland' was number one. It beat Michael Moore's new documentary. 'Zombieland' and the Michael Moore movie are very different, of course. One has a disgusting, lumbering monster that eats everything in its path, and the other one has zombies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is interesting. It was reported that Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is actually part Jewish and that his family changed their name. This is true. Isn't that crazy? His real name is Mark, Mark Ahmadinestein. That's his name.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We begin tonight with the big story that rocked the world on Friday. Chicago failed in its attempt to get the 2016 Olympics, even though the representatives we sent were the most powerful person in the country, and Barack and Michelle Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, you know if you watch the show regularly -- and I hope you do -- last week, I came out in favor of the Olympics in Chicago. I wasn't alone. The leader of the free world flew to Copenhagen to make the case, and she brought along Barack Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, turns out the games are going to Rio. This could be the year they include the Men's 1500 Meter Androgynous Samba.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, for years experts have talked about the problems of the American educational system. They also wrote about them, but nobody reads.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, in a recent study, US fourth graders ranked a shameful 11th in reading scores worldwide. And when it comes to math, we rank below Latvia and Kazakhstan. Well, when you hear statistics like that, as an American, you can only have one reaction. Whoo! Our kids are failing on Obama's watch! Which reminds me, American students also can't read a watch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well now, Obama has proposed his most shocking school reform initiative. 'President Obama says students aren't spending enough time in school. Will students benefit from a longer school day or a full school year? No summer break.' No summer break?! It is a cherished childhood tradition, like fireworks or losing fingers.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, congratulations to president Obama and First Lady Michelle. They celebrated their 17th wedding anniversary this week. Well, at first, they couldn't agree where they should celebrate. He wanted to go to Chicago, she voted for Rio.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think Obama is starting to get a little desperate. After losing the Olympics last week, he scaled back a little bit. Like, today, he was in New York, making the case for Chicago-style pizza.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, in response to criticism that he's not fulfilling a campaign promise, the President's national security adviser said President Obama will overturn the military's 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' policy at the right time. ... When asked what the right time would be, he said, 'Don't ask, I'm not telling.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the Post Office told Congress this week they are sorry, but they can no longer continue to deliver Saturday's mail on Saturday. ... Hey, I'd be happy to get Wednesday's mail on Saturday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, listen to this. ... You can't call the swine flu swine flu anymore. It's now the H1N1 virus. You know why this is? ... This is true. The pork lobby in Washington lobbied hard to get the name changed because they didn't want people to think you could get sick by eating pork. I mean, bacon will still kill you, you just won't get a runny nose.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The cover of Sarah Palin's book has been released. And it features a picture of Palin gazing off into the distance deep in thought. ... The photographer said that capturing that one moment was the rewarding 11 hours of his career.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This weekend, President Obama is going to speak to the nation's largest gay rights group. And members of the group are upset that he hasn't kept his campaign promises to them. ... However, the gay rights group says all will be forgiven if Obama makes his speech shirtless.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The founder of Cirque du Soleil is currently onboard the International Space Station. And today, he got all of the other nine astronauts to put on red clown noses. ... Then the astronauts conducted experiments on the loss of dignity in space.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rapper Method Man didn't pay his taxes for three years. Yesterday, he told a judge he forgot to pay, because he was high. .... And the remarkable thing is that's the one excuse the IRS is totally cool with.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, President Obama went to Denmark to try and get the Olympics for Chicago. They turned him down. He was so upset that they wouldn't give us the Olympics that he had to invite himself to the White House for a beer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Isn't that NASA fascinating? I think NASA may be my favorite governmental agency because they're always doing cool stuff. We went to the moon. Remember how cool that was? We now have the International Space Station and the shuttle goes up there regularly. They worked on the Hubble Telescope. You know what they want to do now? They're thinking about firing a missile to moon. ... I thought, oh, great, another war. Do we need that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama gave a talk to members of the House and Senate today about options for the war in Afghanistan. The title of the speech was 'Any Ideas, Because I Got Nothing.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;North Korea's Kim Jong-Il is now saying that he'll consider talks with the United States if it can help improve our relationship. I'm starting to feel like we're the Jon and Kate of countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Catholic churches throughout New York City are no longer offering wine at communion to help prevent the spread of swine flu. I like that it took swine flu for people to realize that sharing a cup with hundreds of other New Yorkers is a health risk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I read about this. Apple is withdrawing from the US Chamber of commerce, because the Chamber is skeptical of global warming theories. Apple said that it was a tough call to make, but still not as tough as making a call on the iPhone.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a global survey of the most admired countries, the United States went from number seven to number one. ... They don't admire us enough to give us the Olympics, but...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And earlier in the week, President Barack Obama met with 150 doctors. He got all kinds of advice from them. This weekend, he's going to try out the tips they gave him on the golf course.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And over the weekend, the President and the First Lady celebrated their wedding anniversary. They went out to dinner. There were no gifts exchanged. They didn't exchange any gifts because, as you know, that would be socialism.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Obama had a very tense 25-minute meeting aboard Air Force One last week with General McChrystal, our top general in Afghanistan. And apparently, McChrystal gave a speech in London last week very critical of Obama's policies in Afghanistan. And Obama was not happy. In fact, he considers it so important, he's thinking about canceling his upcoming appearance on 'Ellen.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama's national security advisor said the President will overturn the 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' policy in the military. Well I think that's good. I think gay people should be allowed to serve in the military. It seems ridiculous if they're not. ... And listen to this. They'll be able to keep the same slogan, an 'Army of One -- Singular Sensation.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama's national security adviser just said that Obama is going to overturn the military's 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell.' ... As a result, the signal for an enemy attack will change from 'incoming' to 'what's her problem?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's been some squabbling in the Republican Party. ... In a recent interview, John McCain's former campaign manager said that if Sarah Palin is the Republican Party's presidential nominee, the results will be catastrophic...as opposed to when she was the vice presidential nominee and everything went perfectly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The other day at a political fundraiser, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi got to meet actor Robert Redford. And witnesses say she was flirting with him. ... There was an awkward moment when Pelosi winked at Redford and $4,000 worth of Botox squirted out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, listen to this. I'm no rocket scientist so far be it from me to tell these people who are rocket scientists how to do their business, but NASA, they're shooting a missile. ... They're going to launch a huge missile ? kaboom ? right at the moon, looking for water. And I said, 'Why not? Now that everything here is taken care of on Earth, why not? We've got no problems here. Let's just go give it a shot.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So they're going to attack the moon, and they're going to be looking for water. And I thought, well, that's pretty much sounds like our government ? bomb first, look for evidence later. That's the way we do business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nobel Prizes in science...were awarded yesterday, and the three winners in physics are known as the 'masters of light.' ... Not to be confused with Dick Cheney, known as the 'prince of darkness.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, here's something that will put a smile on your face. Yesterday was the first day of the...new Supreme Court session. And...we have a freshman Supreme Court justice, Sonia Sotomayor, and it's her first day in court. So you know what they do? It's like a rookie hazing for the new justices. And it was hilarious. The other judges, yesterday, switched her robe with a blanket. It was unbelievable. Boy, that was funny. Crazy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then, then, Chief Justice Roberts sent her to the hardware store to buy a left-handed gavel. That's a regular yuck rodeo down there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't kid yourself. Sonia Sotomayor really has her work cut out for her. ... Think about this ? the responsibility of replacing Paula Abdul. Is she going to be able to do that? Is that a possibility, even? I don't think so.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here is some very good news. At NASA, the countdown is on. After years of wasting taxpayer money on research to increase the quality of life here on Earth and all that rubbish, NASA is finally doing something cool. They're blowing up the moon!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, it is not a joke. I'm not kidding! Right now, a Centaur missile is hurtling through space, headed for the moon's south pole. And I for one would just like to say how awesome that is!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We could make a ton of money if they find water on the moon. Can you imagine how much showbiz weasels in LA would pay for moon water?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today marked the eighth anniversary of the start of the war in Afghanistan. Dick Cheney celebrated by champagne boarding himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So what NASA is doing, they're crashing a rocket, which will have the energy of two tons of TNT. It's part of NASA's new strategy, 'What would Wile E. Coyote do?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From the start, the Obama Administration made it clear there were going to be big changes. There was going to be basketball in the Rose Garden, Sunday bingo in the Cabinet room, and we were going to talk to our enemies, to everybody. ... There's no one that Obama won't be willing to try and speak with, uh, except for one exception. 'According to this morning's 'Washington Post,' the White House is delaying a meeting between President Obama and the Dalai Lama, in an apparent effort to curry favor with the Chinese.' The Dalai Lama?! The only person Obama draws the line at speaking with is the international prince of peace, a man so gentle, in grade school, he was beaten up by doves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, the Administration was worried that meeting with the Dalai Lama would upset China. And God knows, we don't want to upset China! Gosh, imagine what they'd put in our toys and toothpaste if we upset them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Spin it, Gibbs! 'It's important that the...Tibetan people know that our relationship, our strong relationship, with China helps them. Our relationship with China, having a strong relationship and a good dialogue with them, allows us to talk to them about the cares and concerns of the Tibetan people.' See, baby, I was only talking to that beautiful girl because I was telling her how great you were. And when I leaned in real close, I was just telling her in her ear how much I love you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So we're not talking to Tibet so that we can talk to China about Tibet? I hope no one asks the obvious follow-up. 'Has the President done that?' 'I believe we have mentioned human rights in meeting with the Chinese, yes.' Well, maybe not that exact phrase. We mentioned the words human and rights, I don't think they were adjacent to each other. We ? actually, you know what? Actually, now that I think about it, we may have said the words 'humid nights.' But, they, they knew what we were talking about.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here is an example of how quickly things can turn around. According to a recent poll, President Obama's approval rating in California has dropped. ... In fact, among Hollywood celebrities, it is now down to just 99%.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the big question now, with the troops in Afghanistan, is how soon can we expect a decision from President Obama on this troop thing? We've been waiting, but I don't think it's going to happen any time soon. Remember, it took him five months to decide on a puppy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congress is now considering giving $500 to every baby born in the United States. They want to promote savings. ... And listen to this. It's $1,000 if it turns out your congressman is your baby's father.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Is that a good idea? Have a baby, get $500. You thought a lot of illegal were coming here to have kids before?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's something interesting. Tomorrow, NASA scientists will crash two spacecraft into the surface of the moon in an effort to find ice. .... The spacecrafts are named 'Amtrak One' and 'Amtrak Two.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Scientists are very excited about the possibility of ice on the moon. Not as excited as personal injury attorneys, but almost as excited.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This weekend, President Obama plans to appoint his Administration's first openly gay ambassador, David Huebner.... Huebner will serve as the US ambassador to Barbra Streisand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;NASA is going to launch a rocket to the moon on Friday. They're going to shoot a rocket to the moon. Just going to -- kaboom, kaboom! ... The government says don't worry, that they're pretty certain we will be greeted as liberators.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're bombing the moon. We're attacking the moon. And we hope to find out if there's water. And you know that is how we do stuff. We launch the attack then we look for the evidence.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, President Obama had dozens of middle school students over to the White House. ... And they set up 20 telescopes outside to look at the stars. The kids were kind of bratty, though. One of them was like, 'Hey, look, I can see Rio de Janeiro.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And tonight, Obama...hosted a basketball game at the White House for several members of Congress. He didn't even want to play, he just wanted to see Congress pass something.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The basketball game was very intense. At one point, Hillary landed hard and sprained her cankle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;News out of Afghanistan. The Taliban say that they have no plan of harming countries of the world, including those in Europe. ... I'm not sure how convincing that sounds. It is like telling your RA, 'I have no beer in this room at all, especially not under my bed.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was reading that NASA is going to fire that rocket into the crater of the moon tomorrow morning, and people can follow the mission on Facebook and on Twitter. And you can go to Friendster, too, and follow the original moon landing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of NASA, you guys heard about this asteroid that can strike the Earth in 2036? ... NASA just downgraded the threat collision to 1 in 250,000. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is an historic night. Tonight, for the first time in American history, we are preparing to attack the moon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The United States is bombing the moon tonight. NASA is honestly planning to fire a rocket-powered explosive into one of the lunar poles. See, this is what happens when your president's slogan is 'Yes we can.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This bombing expedition cost NASA $79 million. Do you have any idea how many Nicolas Cage movies you could make for $79 million? Almost one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I was NASA, I would have auctioned the chance to fire the missile that blows up the moon on eBay, right? I mean, it would have paid for itself. 'Dude, who gets the push the button to explode the moon? Me, that's right.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congratulations to President Barack Obama. Won the Nobel Peace Prize. Very exciting. ... Hang on now. Don't get too excited. He hasn't actually collected it yet.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, when Vice President Joe Biden heard that President Obama won the Nobel Prize, he was speechless. So, it's already doing some good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know who was the runner up for the Peace Prize? Oakland Raiders defense. They are true pacifists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, it was announced today they gave the Nobel Prize in economics to two American economists. Really, we have economists? Where the hell they been the last five years?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How awful is this? Police arrested a 30-year-old, Bountiful, Utah, man for fondling the nurse who was helping to deliver his baby.... Move over John Edwards. We have a new nominee for husband of the year.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you see what happened today? President Obama won another Nobel Prize today, this time in medicine, for pretending to give up smoking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you know the Nobel Peace Prize comes with a cash award? It's like a million dollars. Actually, it's $1.4 million. See, apparently, this is President Obama's plan to finance healthcare reform. Keep winning these awards -- the Nobel, the Powerball, the Publishers Clearinghouse Sweepstakes -- keep winning these, and we can pay for the whole healthcare thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in NFL news, conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh trying to buy the St. Louis Rams. So far, this season, the Rams are what, 0-5? ... What is it with the Republicans? They can't seem to pick a winning team lately. What's going on?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People still upset that Barack Obama got the Nobel Peace Prize. ... And today...the head of the Nobel Prize Committee defended the decision to give Obama this year's peace prize, saying that Obama's already accomplished quite a bit. ... When asked for an example, the committee chairman said, 'Come on, he won the freaking Nobel Peace Prize.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Nobel committee is saying the reason they gave Obama the peace prize is for reducing tension around the world. ... So, the runners up for this year's Nobel Prize were red wine and the Brookstone three speed massaging recliner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new article just came out. It shows that the phrase used most often by President Obama is, 'Let me be clear'...whereas the phrase used most often by Joe Biden is, 'Hey, where are you all going?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you! I uh, I deserve that like Obama deserves the Nobel Peace Prize.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's some news. President Obama's healthcare plan passed the Senate Finance Committee this afternoon. Republicans are disappointed because...they had their own version of the health plan. That was going to be swine flu masks and Purell.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Republicans are quite upset. John McCain had to console that 'you lie' guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain said that Sarah Palin is still a force in the Republican Party. ... Then he got in his car and backed over his mailbox.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, President Obama wants to...put an end to the 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' policy in the military...not to be confused with Dick Cheney's policy, 'Don't Look, Don't Aim.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton, secretary of state, says she will eventually retire and will not be running for president ever again, unlike George W. Bush, who retired as soon as he was elected president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know in Washington today, a Republican senator from Maine voted with the Democrats on healthcare? ... That's the first time a Republican switched sides and was not arrested in an airport bathroom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Treasury Department said yesterday that the Taliban is much better funded than al Qaeda. Al Qaeda said they would have done better if they had not invested everything with Bernie Madoff.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Colorado will become the first state ever to lower its minimum wage by three cents an hour, from $7.28 to $7.25. As a compromise, Colorado workers will be allowed to leave work nine seconds earlier.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wal-Mart employees were like, 'There's a minimum wage?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last Saturday, President Obama promised, as he does every month for about a year and a half to two years now, that he would end 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell.' But this pronouncement was significant in that it came the night before tens of thousands of gay rights activities marched on Washington to protest the President's lack of action, to bring national attention to their struggle for equal rights, and, from the looks of the flags, to taunt leprechauns. 'Ah, me gold must be under this rainbow. No, not this one. Why are you doing this to me?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tens of thousands of protesters marching on Washington. I imagine that is going to cause a media firestorm. Well, CNN gave us some coverage...although they didn't send any reporters to the scene. MSNBC did have a reporter on scene to do a couple of interviews before the march, but then they had to cut away -- and this is true -- to their regularly scheduled programming, 'A Deadly Affair: Honeymoon From Hell.' 'Honeymoon from Hell' -- be careful what you wish for, gay marriage marchers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So how did...Fox News cover this movement? 'You are looking at a live picture there provided by ABC News.' You didn't even send your own camera crew? You have a Washington bureau. Tell them to go the window and point the camera down. Gay people aren't vampires. They show up on camera.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you have probably heard, to the surprise of pretty much everyone, our President will be receiving the Nobel Peace Prize. ... It even caught the commander in cool off guard. 'This is not how I expected to wake up this morning.' 'Normally, flock of blue birds flies through my window, gently lifts my sheets, as a bear cub fetches my slippers and Bambi briefs me on the latest troop movements in Afghanistan. Being president is awesome.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There seems to be a general consensus between the President's mortal enemies, and the Taliban, that he hasn't done enough to deserve this award. Time to prove 'em wrong. Mr. President, you've just gotten the Nobel Peace Prize. What game changing, peace loving move will you make, just 90 minutes after finding out the news, to show that they gave the peace prize to the right man? 'NASA literally bombed the moon.' Prize for peace on Earth, baby. Suck that, moon!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you for coming out on such a wet day. Man! The rain we've been having. What a storm this has been. The roads are slicker than John Edwards on 'Cheaters.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the big story out of Washington is this healthcare bill passed the Senate Finance Committee by a vote of 14-9, I believe it was. The Bill cost over $800 billion. And that's just what lobbyists had to give to members of Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The good news is we'll probably have some kind of improvement in our healthcare system. The bad news is it won't be in our lifetime. ... It will never happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Fox News White House correspondent, a man named Major Garrett, has the swine flu. ... President Obama has ordered Fox News quarantined for up to five years, as long as it takes!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, of course, the Republicans still can't believe that Barack Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize. And the Democrats can't believe that Sarah Palin wrote a book. So, it's even.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And for the first time in a year, the Dow closed above 10,000.... You know...what that means? More AIG bonuses!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Department of Homeland Security announced that...instead of putting illegal immigrants in jail, what they're going to do is...let them stay at converted hotels. ... Let me explain how this works. If you're a homeless American whose house has been foreclosed on, you're desperate for shelter, here's what you do. You sneak across the boarder to Mexico, you walk back in; the government puts you up at the Sheraton. Fantastic deal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rush Limbaugh, who is trying to buy the St. Louis Rams, has downplayed racial comments that he's made in the past by saying...if he was a racist, why would he want to be part of a business that is 70% African American? Well, I don't know. Maybe because you would own them? Think that has anything to do with it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And over the weekend, they held a big gay rights march in Washington, DC. Tens of thousand of gay Americans of all political persuasions filled hotel rooms in DC. Actually, it was just the Democrats in the rooms. The Republicans were still in the closet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, the White House hosted a tribute to Latin music. ... President Obama wiggled his hips a little on the dance floor...at which point a committee in Sweden immediately awarded him a Latin Grammy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some of the celebrities at the White House Latin music event included Gloria Estefan, George Lopez, Eva Longoria, and Jose Feliciano. ... Apparently it was much more fun than last year's party, which was just President Bush and Dora the Explorer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A top adviser to President Obama says that the most important interactions the President has with Joe Biden happen when no one else is around. ... Obama...says that the best interactions with Biden happen when Biden isn't around.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;NASA recently announced they have a photograph from the Hubble Telescope that shows two galaxies colliding. ... Then they took a closer look and said, 'Wait a second. Those galaxies aren't colliding. They're doing it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Healthcare has now passed the Senate Finance Committee. ... So now here's what the Republicans are going to do to try and kill the healthcare bill. They're going to go into filibuster... where the guy gets the floor and he just keeps yacking and yacking and yacking and yacking and yacking. And people get tired and go home. Hey, wait, that could happen right now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain's going to do the filibustering and he's going to talk about his collection of big band records.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama's doing a great job, in impossible circumstances, by the way. ... You know he won the Nobel Peace Prize a couple of days ago. ... And the week before that, he won the daytime Nobel Peace Prize. So he's won them...both.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin's memoir will be out next month. ... Revelations in the memoir. ... The last couple of months on the campaign, it was actually Tina Fey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They also say that during her debate with Joe Biden -- the vice presidential debate -- she got...confused and at one point actually said, 'I'm ready to solve the puzzle, Pat.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, the Democrats' healthcare bill made it past the Senate Finance Committee, in a 14-9 vote. Sorry if I spoiled the ending for you guys. I know a local lot of you probably TiVo C-SPAN.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But yes, that's what happened. Republican senator Olympia Snowe...broke ranks with her party and voted for the Democrats' healthcare bill. ... She's been missing ever since.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm so excited, because I had Olympia Snowe on my fantasy Congress team. I'm like, 'Yeah! Score, man!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But even though the bill passed, President Obama said that now is not the time to pat ourselves on the back, mostly because you might pull a muscle. He says, 'Wait until you actually have health insurance before you do anything.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, in sports news, the big story is the NFL now stands for 'Not For Limbaugh.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, as you...probably know, conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh has been dropped from a group of investors who were trying to buy the St. Louis Rams. Speculation was that Limbaugh was considered by the league to be too controversial, you know, unlike Michael Vick, Pacman Jones, coach Tom cable, Plaxico Burress. The NFL hates controversy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, some...good news for Rush. The Oakland Raiders are offering to give him the team for free.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What's going on with the Oakland Raiders? You know, I don't want to say the Raiders are bad, but you know, now, a lot of fans are painting their faces just so they won't be recognized.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, it's probably best for Limbaugh because he would have been a minority owner. And once he became a minority, he would have to become a liberal and then he would have hated himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And for the first time in over a year, the Dow hit 10,000. Very exciting. Now, if you don't know...what the Dow is, that is a list of companies President Obama hasn't taken over yet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, a new poll just came out that shows that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is now more popular than President Obama.... Hillary said she's thrilled....to win a popularity contest a year after it matters.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republicans are now planning to filibuster President Obama's healthcare plan. You know, it is a legislative device. A guy gets up and talks all night without really saying anything. It's like having dinner with Regis.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It' not a great day for old folks. Today, the Social Security Administration announced there will be no cost of living increase for senior citizens. ....

That would have worked out. That would be like hiring Michael Vick to look after your dog!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, the accident was so bad they're calling the plane 'Air Force Two.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was announced last night that President Obama wants to send $250 checks to over 57 million American seniors. When he heard the news, John McCain was like, 'Forget everything I said, this guy's awesome!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama is going to send $250 to all of those senior citizens. The bad news is that he's going to send them $10 at a time on their birthday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said yesterday that if she had won the presidential election, she would have hired Barack Obama to serve in her cabinet. Come on, he's her boss. What is she going the say? 'That guy, Barack, he' terrible.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Historic news from Wall Street yesterday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above the 10,000 mark. You know what that means? It's a second chance ta party like it's 1999, because as far as the stock market is concerned, it is now exactly where it was in 1999. So, woo-hoo. Cigars and cocaine for everybody! Yay, 1999!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Stocks have rebounded 53% just since March, for, no apparent reason whatsoever. And seeing as you probably didn't buy in March, only 47% more to go and you'll have broken even.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ever since the Republicans suffered a difficult loss in the 2008 election, we've waited to see who would emerge from the rubble as the new face of the party. Hopefuls have included a young Sarah Palin, a Rush Limbaugh, and of course, Craig T. Nelson. But, here's one I did not see coming. Jackie Robinson! He is featured on the Republican National Committee's new website as not only a 'great athlete,' but also a 'great Republican.' In fact, as one of the pioneering black Republicans, you might say he was the Jackie Robinson of...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And he was, a 'great Republican,' if by 'great' you mean an independent who wrote in his autobiography: 'By and large Republicans had ignored blacks and sometimes handpicked a few servile leaders in the black community.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's all part of the GOP's new revamped website, the brainchild of RNC Chairman...Michael Steele. ... Oh look. Here he comes now! 'Notice anything different? It's the new GOP.com. It's a forward looking, open platform for the party of new ideas ? the new Republican Party.' ... You know, I can't figure out if this website is trying to condescend to black people or young people. 'It's not even really a website. It's a platform for folks to come on and get engaged with the GOP. I said when I ran for chairman that I wanted to take this party to the streets.' I think it's condescending to both.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I'm down with GOP, yes, we've met previously. ... Because if you're trying to reach out to black people, pimping out the flag, giving it hydraulics on your website, icing it out -- not cool. And as for reaching out to the young people. 'He does have his own blog on the website.' Oooo. What's it called? 'It's called 'What Up?' ... Ironically, after one day, 'What Up?' was no longer up. They decided to change the name of the blog by calling it 'Change the Game,' which is better than the original title they were going to go with, which was, 'Change the Leader of the National Republican Committee.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, like every new website, this one did have a few kinks. 'This was supposed to be the 'Future Republican Leaders' page, which initially said it was completely blank and then it said could not be found.' Your words, not mine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, I got a great costume. You know what I'm doing this year, costume-wise? Fantastic idea. I'm going to drive around with a cell phone taped to my head and go as Maria Shriver.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I love this. Governor Schwarzenegger, Arnold Schwarzenegger, said he would take swift action against his wife. See, that's the way men talk around other men when they're talking about their wives. 'When I get home, I'm going to take swift action.' You know, soon as he gets home: 'Honey, please, I am so sorry.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And later this month, the International Atomic Energy Agency is going to get their first look at the other nuclear facility in Iran.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a new study shows that the phrase most often used by president Obama is, 'Let me be clear.' ... The phrase he uses the least often? 'Let me be specific.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama was in...New Orleans, visiting the victims of Katrina yesterday. And he took questions from the audience. And one person asked him, 'What do you think about the Big Easy?' and he said, 'Oh, I just call it 'Nobel Peace Prize.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was kept in the hospital overnight after she became drowsy, fell from her seat when they were boarding the airplane. Kind of serious. Officials said she had a reaction to some medicine she was taking. She just fell out of her seat. See, her health is really important because the court is really divided now. She is right in the middle. In fact, four of the justices voted to just leave her on the ground.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sure you know by now, Rush Limbaugh was dropped by the group that was hoping to buy the St. Louis Rams. Well, they criticized Limbaugh for being insensitive to minorities. Well, this is the same league that has the Washington Redskins.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, the investors...dropped him. They wanted someone less controversial. I understand they're now talking with Roman Polanski about coming on board.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Obama was in New Orleans.... A little boy asked President Obama, 'Why do people hate you?' ... Then the little boy turned to Joe Biden and said, 'I know why people hate you.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. You're shaking like a Mexican washing machine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Instead of the CDC, it's recommended by GMC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Every time you sneeze, your nose falls off -- wow, that's a bad flu shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Doctor claims he made it from freshly squeezed hogs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Nurse sterilizes needle with her whiskey sour.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what happened on this date in 1867? ... Russia gave Alaska to the United States. I had an interesting thought, kind of an interesting thought, or as close as I get to an interesting thought. If Alaska is still part of Russia, then Sarah Palin could wave to herself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a new poll out that says that Hillary Clinton is more popular than Barack Obama. ... But you have to consider how these polls are phrased. This poll was worded, 'Which dude would you rather have a beer with?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new survey found that the average man cries about six times a year. That number would be a lot lower if it weren't for Glenn Beck.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was smart for them to try this balloon stunt while President Obama's in office. That wouldn't have worked with Bush Administration. Cheney would have shot that balloon down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if you saw it Friday. That whole -- people thought the 6-year-old kid was in the balloon. I mean, it was so tense, Maria Shriver put down her cell phone while driving, picked up her Sony TV Watchman to watch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to 'USA Today,' car theft is at a 20-year low. ... Well, that shows you how bad the auto business is. People don't even want to steal them now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama announced he wants to give every senior citizen $250 next year. This is part of his 'Cash for Geezers' program.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually,&quot; if &quot;you're a senior citizen working on Wall Street, then you get $250 million.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is kind of interesting. Osama bin Laden's first wife ? it's always the first wife -- is coming out with a book that gives a rare glimpse into the personal life of the infamous al Qaeda leader.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And prosecutors in New York City have filed charges against a man they claim scammed dozens of illegal immigrants by posing as an immigration lawyer.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well here's some good terrorist gossip. Osama bin Laden's first wife has written a book about him. And you know, typical ex-wives, they always make the guy look like the bad one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, Osama bin Laden's first wife and her son have written a book about her marriage.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, this is interesting. Did you know bin Laden's first wife was also his first cousin? That doesn't sound like al Qaeda. That sounds like Alabama, doesn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well this is kind of odd. Sarah Palin has posted her resume on an employment networking site. Under 'jobs held,' she -- you know, she was a sportscaster. Did you know that? She was also, of course, governor of Alaska and, most recently, private nurse for Senator John McCain. I didn't realize that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin's first stop on her upcoming book tour will be none other than the Oprah show, which is nice. But shouldn't Sarah Palin be going on Maury first? No? No.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, former Vice President Dick Cheney accused President Obama of 'dithering' over the strategy for the war in Afghanistan. ... Don't confuse that with what President Bush used to do. That was doodling.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House is calling for bailed out executives -- you know these guys we gave all the money to in the banking industry -- to get a 90% pay cut. ... They want their pay cut 90%, so it's more in line with the job they're doing. Here's my question. Why can't we get this for Congress?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually...the Target stores are coming under fire for selling these illegal alien costumes. Oh, you hear how Target is defending it? ... They say the costume is only for kids who take the candy American kids don't want to take.&quot;</SPAN></P>

But Obama now is ordering that their pay be slashed by up to 90%, and needless to say, the executives aren't happy about it. ... And...in fairness to them, they point out that they destroyed the world economy last year, so, to take away their money this year isn't fair.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's something very disturbing. According to the...American Medical Association, the number of deaths from hospital errors is four times the number of deaths from auto accidents. Do you know what that means? If you get into an auto accident ? for God's sake -- don't let them take you to a hospital.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And some people are already criticizing the Obama Administration's decision to cut the pay of executives at companies that received bailout money. They say this could cause a lot of these guys to quit. Ah, who wouldn't hate that, huh? You wouldn't want to lose the geniuses who lost us hundreds of billions of dollars. Please, don't go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this sounds serious. China has accused Google of copyright infringement, claiming Google scanned hundreds of China's authors' works for Google's digital library without permission. ... In fact, China is so upset they have threatened to stop using Google to illegally download American movies and CDs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was big news at the White House today, where Annie Leibovitz' much-anticipated family portrait of the Obamas was unveiled. The whole family looks great in it, especially Oprah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Annie Leibovitz is probably the most famous portrait photographer in the world. And she's taken some unbelievably great photographs, but I have to say, I'm not quite sure she nailed this one. You know, they could fix that red eye thing. I don't know why they wouldn't.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, besides posing for the family Christmas card, President Obama has been busy trying to craft a healthcare plan that will please both moderates and liberals. Yesterday, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid sent up a trial balloon for a proposal that would allow the government to offer healthcare alongside private insurers. Unfortunately, there turned out to be a kid in that trial balloon. ... Don't worry, though, he's okay.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, what else? The St. Louis Rams lost yesterday to the Indianapolis Colts. ... The Rams are now 0-7. ... In fact, they're so bad, the Rams called Rush Limbaugh collect and said, 'Make us an offer. Anything, please.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to CBS News, President Obama has played more golf in nine months than George Bush in nearly three years. Actually, Obama's a good golfer. You know what his handicap is? Joe Biden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And former Vice President Dick Cheney has accused the White House of 'dithering' over the strategy for the war in Afghanistan. Today, the White House said they're thinking it over, and they should have an answer for him in six to eight weeks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's getting nasty. Cheney said that when it comes to Afghanistan, Obama seems to be 'afraid.' Afraid? Isn't Cheney the one that was hiding in the underground bunker?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An MSNBC anchor, Contessa Brewer, made an embarrassing mistake on the air last week. She called Jesse Jackson, 'Al Sharpton.' Even worse than that, after he told her, 'I'm Jesse Jackson,' she said, 'Are you the one that's between Jermaine and Tito?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is in the news. ... He's been criticized for only playing sports with other men. He's been taking some slack for that lately, so yesterday, he played golf with one of his top female advisers...or as Fox News reported it, 'Obama plays a round with another woman.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a great day for America, everybody. Yes, it is. It is our secretary of state's birthday. It is Hillary Clinton's birthday. Happy birthday, Hillary. President Obama asked her what she wanted, she said 'Your job.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bill Clinton is planning a romantic candlelight dinner tonight. Then he'll go home and see Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, guys, this is big news. President Obama just declared the swine flu outbreak a national emergency. A couple of weeks ago, it was like, 'Calm down, it's going to be fine.' Now it's a national emergency. I'm telling you, swine flu is a big threat, then it's not, then it is. Make up your mind. This thing is like the Brett Favre of infectious diseases.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As telecommunications expert Ted Stevens once explained, the Internet is a 'series of tubes.' Now currently, everything moves through those tubes at pretty much the same rate. ... Right now, the FCC is considering this issue called 'net neutrality.' The Internet service providers...would like 'net neutrality' not to happen, so that they would have the ability to decide which content and websites would get...preferential treatment. ... It's kind of like creating a carpool lane on the Internet, except instead of high-occupancy vehicles, only rich a $%holes will be able to drive in it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So who could possibly be against establishing 'net neutrality'? ... 'Senator John McCain wants the government to keep its hands off the Internet.' Ah, McCain. Old Pony Express Johnson steps into the void left by Ted Stevens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Keeping government hands off the Internet. That's the purpose of legislation Senator John McCain introduced today. It's called the Internet Freedom Act of 2009.' ... Now I know it sounds like that bill is the opposite of what its name implies, in the way that, say, George Bush's Clear Skies Act gutted environmental regulations,&quot; but &quot;it's not. McCain is proposing that AT&amp;T and Verizon be given freedom, to control what information passes through the Internet. Information like, John McCain is the number one recipient of donations from the telecom industry and their lobbyists for the past three years, which I looked up on the Google, and it loaded pretty fast.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Friend of the show, staunch conservative George Will, a man so bow tied to tradition that this spring he wrote a column in 'The Washington Post' decrying blue jeans as 'demon denim,' has for the last two Sundays on ABC's 'This Week,' wore a long tie! Doesn't George know that long neckties are the blue jeans of the throat?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now I know what you're all saying at home. You're saying, 'Stephen, you wear long ties.' Yes, but I can handle them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Clearly, his bow ties were the only thing tethering George Will to reality, because listen to what long tie George Will said: 'Marijuana is getting much better.' ... Then he tried to eat George Stephanopoulos because he thought he was a Teddy Graham.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then George Will took another toke on that long tie stick. 'We have legalized prostitution, as anyone who opens a telephone phone book and looks under escort can tell you.' I don't know which is more disturbing -- that George Will goes to prostitutes or that he still uses the phone book.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, I don't like Washington state. First off, they're putting us all in danger by trying to pop space with that giant needle. And now just look what their governor did. 'Surrounded by same sex couples and their families, the governor signed a bill today that guarantees them 'everything but marriage.' ... They call it 'everything but marriage,' but I say if it looks like a duck, files a joint tax return like a duck, and gets to visit its duck partner in a duck hospital, you might as well register at the Duck Pottery Barn, because it is gay duck marriage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thankfully, a group called 'Protect Marriage Washington' led a petition drive that put a referendum on the ballot to overturn 'everything but marriage.' ... Well, of course, the 'Gaystapo' has now asked the state to disclose the names of everyone who signed the petition. But the conservative group that organized it wants to keep the names secret. I assume they'll hide the list in a place where gay people would never look -- like JC Penney's.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and in a speech in Canada, former President George W. Bush said he was proud that when he was in office...he didn't sell his soul, which is true. He rented it to Dick Cheney, who then sublet it to Halliburton, but it's totally different.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And an auditor found rampant fraud in the government's first-time home buyers program. ... The auditor found that starter home money even went to four-year-olds. Imagine that. Four-year-olds got a home loan, which is good news for Jon and Kate's kids because now they can get their own place. Don't have to deal with those two idiots anymore.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Osama bin Laden's ex-wife has written a tell-all book about the terrorist. Even terrorists get scared when their ex-wives write a book.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Doctors now are saying that marijuana can be used to treat hemorrhoids, which is kind of ironic, don't you think, using marijuana to cure a crack problem?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyone here excited about the Yankees-Phillies World Series game? ... Here's the latest. Senator Charles Schumer of New York is betting Pennsylvania Senator Arlen Specter a case of New York cheesecakes versus a case of Philadelphia cheese steaks. ... So whoever wins the bet will die of a heart attack.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, former President George W. Bush made his debut as a motivational speaker. ... Afterwards, Bush said, 'The crowd was so motivated, many of them left halfway through.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They say now that President Barack Obama's playing a lot of golf. Did you know he plays a lot of golf? I didn't know that. Good for him. Play golf. Play all the golf you want. The world is going to hell anyway. What possible difference could it make if he's playing golf?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, he has played more golf in his few months in office than George Bush played in eight years. ... So Barack Obama, playing more golf than George Bush. But to be fair, President Bush played more mini-golf.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I mean, it's no secret, if you're the President of the United States, the pressure is incredible, unrelenting, it will crush you. You've got to get out and do stuff. You have to take a break. You have to go play golf. You've got to ride a bike and go jogging. You have to shoot a hunting buddy in the face. I mean, it will kill you, the pressure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Guess what? The former governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin...will be appearing on the Oprah Winfrey show next month. Coincidentally, John McCain will be on Dr. Oz next month getting a colonoscopy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin is promoting her brand new book. It's called 'Going Rogue'...because she really was out there on the edge. The book is going to be huge. It will be an enormous. As a matter of fact, the FDA gave it quite a boost. The Food and Drug Administration said her book has been approved as an over-the -counter sleep aid. It will be crazy big.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I stand behind no man in my regard for the great Oprah Winfrey. ... But if you really wanted to see Sarah Palin on a TV show, would you want to see her on the Oprah show or would you want to see her here? Well, that ain't gonna happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But if you think about it, Sarah Palin and Oprah Winfrey have a lot in common. They both helped get Obama elected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The University of Chicago, where President Obama once taught law, they want to house the Barack Obama presidential library. The library will be just like President George W. Bush's library, except it will have books.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of former President Bush, he gave a motivational speech in Florida yesterday. Bush spoke for half an hour and said he 'just hopes' his 'words were inspirationistic.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush is actually really good at motivating. Last year, he motivated everyone to vote for Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After the President invited only men to play basketball with him earlier this month, the National Organization for Women is complaining that the Obama Administration has a 'boy's club' atmosphere, not to be confused with the Clinton Administration, where they had a gentleman's club atmosphere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday was the 25th anniversary of the release of...'Terminator.' 'Terminator' is a movie we liked so much, we elected it governor here in California.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I have to say, it's hard...to believe it's been 25 years since 'Terminator' came out, mostly because our governor never stops reminding us of it. He...mentions it pretty much every day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This weekend, President Obama declared a national emergency in response to the growing threat of swine flu. So I guess I better stop licking doorknobs for real this time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In response to Obama's declaration, the Republican leaders this morning came out in support of the swine flu ...Not really.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember when President Bush left the White House? ... You remember his first priority was to shore up his historic legacy. ... Not legacy. What's the word I was looking for? What was he shoring up? 'Mr. Bush told him he needs to 'replenish the 'ol coffers,' noting he can make what he calls 'ridiculous money' on the lecture circuit.' 'Yo, I'm gonna make ridiculous money, yo! It's gonna be redonculous!. My name is George Bush, and I'm gonna make it rain!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well on Monday, President Bush reemerged. I wonder which prestigious university and/or historical society he chose to speak at. 'Mr. Bush is going to be the special guest speaker at a 'Get Motivated!' seminar on Monday. According to the website, tickets are a recession friendly $19.' All right. Uh, $19. Still, 10,000 people, $19, $190,000. You can probably get a cut from the concessions and t-shirts, it's still...hot coin. 'Nineteen dollars, and that's not per person, it's per office.' What the?!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The motivational lectures are the brainchild of Peter and Tamara Lowe, a couple whose last couple motivational speaking company was shut down, 'owing millions' in unpaid bills, with attendees making claims 'of false advertising.' So how do they afford charging 19 bucks per office yet still attract such high profile speakers as Bill Clinton, Ronald Reagan, Colin Powell, and of course, Dubya. Well, it's easy. Once you're there, they bombard the audience with sales pitches for more expensive, yet equally useless, motivational products.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But don't take my word for it. Here's founder, Tamara Lowe. 'I'm a former drug addict, dealer, and dropout. But I'm telling you: success and significance in life is all about motivation. Success in life is not to the wise or strong, the talented or intelligent.' Ladies and gentlemen, George W. Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Basically the President broke his silence to speak at the live equivalent of one of those creepy low budget infomercials for exercise equipment...you're never going to use.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're facing big challenges on how to fight the eight-year-old war in Afghanistan. Some say we need to send in 40,000 more troops. By some, I mean the guy running the war. But others say we don't need the new troops, that we could just make due with the troops we already have there, just make them bigger. Keep in mind that was suggested by my friend, Carl.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Others say, 'What if we just turn around and shut our eyes, or better yet, build a time machine and go back and kill Afghanistan's mother, thus making Afghanistan never exist?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whichever plan you favor, a decision can't be made until we know that there is a legitimate government in place there. So we watched with great interest as the recent September elections were laced with scandal and fraud and demands for a runoff that presumed victor Hamid Karzai, uh, poo pooed. 'The Afghan people turned out and voted. And I can assure you that the vote was true and fair.' ... But that was six weeks ago. 'Do you believe definitively that the runoff will be held in two weeks?' 'It has to be held.' Wha! Someone's changed their tune. What changed his mind? I'll give you a hint: America sent a certain charismatic, persuasive, silver tongued Democratic leader over there. ... 'Senator John Kerry.' That's who got it done, Senator John Kerry? Slow-tongued McWindsurfington? That guy got Karzai to change his mind?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's the start of nearly 20 hours spent trying to soften the Afghan leader.' He spent 20 hours, straight, with the Afghan leader? Well, that must be the controversial practice known as 'waterboring.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All right, Senator, in your own words, if you would, please, briefly tell us what happened. 'I think we ate, uh, lunch or dinner, three times, together with, uh, large groups, and then we broke into smaller groups. He took me on a personal, uh, tour of the old palace, where the king lived. He showed me when the Taliban did to the tapestries. Talking with him about Afghan history, about his family, their tribe, his father ? and, and, uh, you know, like any leader, he had internal pressures. And he, to his credit, uh, you know, didn't just lock the door and shut his mind and say, 'I've had enough,' but he, uh, he engaged. As I said, I've done this for a while, but I had one of the more interesting personal journeys, if you will.' 'Fine! ... We'll do a recount. Just shut up! Shut up and get out of my country! I can't take it anymore!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How is it that John Kerry's recap of a 20-hour conversation takes 22 hours?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So President Obama is waiting for the final election results while weighing his many different options for this difficult decision, or to put that more negatively, to the talking pointanator! 'In Afghanistan, he's dithering.' 'Frankly, the dithering that we've seen.' 'Dithering on Afghanistan.' 'The military wants to win and their commander-in-chief is dithering!' 'The White House must stop dithering while America's armed forces are in danger.' Yeah, who put them in danger again? Oh, that's right. You know, 'you should never weigh your options,' as Dick Cheney says. You know the old expression: 'Shoot first and then check to see if it was one of your friends or a bird.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So your objection to Obama's 'dithering' is because your Administration was so proactive with its Afghan strategy? 'The President's chief of staff claimed that the Bush Administration had not asked any tough questions about Afghanistan. In the fall of 2008, fully aware of the need to meet new challenges being posed by the Taliban, we dug into every aspect of Afghanistan policy.' See, they did ask the tough questions about Afghanistan. I'm sorry, wait. When did you ask the tough questions again? 'In the fall of 2008.' The war was seven years old, and you -- what season did you ask that? 'The fall.' Of what year? '2008.' What the -- what?! You clearly cannot be complaining about Obama's 'dithering' when you yourself are asserting -- no, no, no, no, no ? bragging, that your Administration didn't review the Afghan strategy until you were packing to leave!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, I am pumped! Woo! ... And...it is all thanks to yesterday's 'Get Motivated!' seminar in Fort Worth, Texas, with keynote speaker George W. Bush! I mean, just check out what this man said in his speech, and I defy you not to get jacked on the positive sauce. Speaking of his Presidency, he said, quote, '...some days were great, some days were not so great.' Woo! I mean, that covers all the days!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Listen to how...pumped up Bush got attendee Patrick Kruger from Lubbock, Texas, who said, quote, 'He wasn't the best speaker.' Or Chris Clarke from Dallas, who said, '...other speakers were better...'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wish I could have been there, but I had to be here doing my stupid show. Besides, who can afford the admission fee of ' $4.95'? What am I, made of nickels?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, I think history will judge that George W. Bush was a great motivator. After all, he motivated millions to vote for Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, even though I'm a man of means, I still know that folks are hurting out there. There are so many unemployed people on the street, I've had to put a snow plow on my limo just to get through them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But some are hurting more than others. I'm talking, of course, about Wall Street executives. President Obama's pay czar has demanded that companies that took bailout money cut their highest paid employees' salaries by up to 90%, beginning in November. So fat cats, this is your last week you'll be getting your full pay. I say it's time to blow that cash faster than you blew grandma's retirement.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is interesting. One of the top selling costumes this Halloween...is a vampire version of President Obama called 'Barackula.' ... Also very popular is the vampire version of former Vice President Dick Cheney, called 'Dick Cheney.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By gosh, the World Series&quot; starts &quot;tonight. ... You know who is going to be at the game tonight, at Yankee Stadium? Michelle Obama and Jill Biden. Wife of the President, wife of the Vice President. And they will be sitting right next to the two sleeping Northwest pilots.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin, is promoting...her new book and she's going to appear on the 'Oprah Winfrey Show.' And everybody in the audience on Oprah that night gets a free 30-06.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah and Oprah. On the one hand, a very powerful woman qualified to be President of the United States, and on the other hand, you have Sarah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First Lady Michelle Obama and Second Lady Jill Biden were at game one of the World Series tonight in New York. ... They went because Michelle loves baseball, and Mrs. Biden loves getting out of the house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We got more fun from out Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger today. Apparently when the Governor vetoes a bill, he sends a note along explaining his reasoning for the veto, which is a thoughtful thing to do, I guess. But in some cases he may have an ulterior motive, like this letter he sent a Democrat who'd heckled him at an appearance earlier this month. 'The Governor likes to attach messages to the bills he rejects that explain his reasoning. But a message back to Assemblyman Tom Ammiano had a creatively placed insult in there, as well. ... The first letters in each line of the explanation apparently spelled out the f-word, followed by y-o-u.' Well, you know, that's just the Austrian way of saying, 'Hasta la vista, baby.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Halloween's right around the corner, right? So it is only appropriate that our nation's healthcare debate has been recently plagued by some spooky happenings. ... 'Wasn't so long ago that the public option was considered dead, with a stake through its heart. Big announcement, just a little while ago on Capitol Hill, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid put the public option back in the healthcare reform bill.' It's alive! It's alive!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Who turned Reid around on this public option thing? 'Pressure from...the liberal base of the Democratic Party is really getting to the Democratic leadership.' 'It looks as if Harry Reid's hands were tied by the left wing of his party.' Ah, yes, the hand tying left wing of the Democratic Party, otherwise known as, 'At least 55% of Americans' who favor a public option.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, you know I love mavericks. That's why I like almost friend-of-the-show, almost-Democrat Joe Lieberman. ... Because yesterday, he announced that he will join a Republican filibuster of any healthcare bill that includes a public option. 'It's still a government-run health insurance plan that puts the Federal taxpayer on the line and I don't want to do that at this point in our nation's history.' Exactly, the perfect point in our nation's history was during the last ten years, when Joe Lieberman said he supported it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, some people in Connecticut are upset that Joe now opposes the public option, namely, the 64% of people in Connecticut who support a public option.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But remember, Joe's party is 'Connecticut for Lieberman,' not 'Lieberman for Connecticut.' Big difference.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You see, Joe's a true independent. He's independent of political parties, and he's independent of his constituents.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Joe is not the only one under attack in this debate. President Obama has been demonizing health insurance companies with a viciousness he usually reserves for fair and balanced news networks who happen to compare him to Hitler.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I bet you you go to Dick Cheney's house, trick-or-treating he is one of those guys that tells you you are going to have to spend the night because the bridge is out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former Governor of Alaska Sarah Palin will be making an appearance on the Oprah Winfrey Show, ladies and gentlemen. It's going to be good. It's going to be great because on the one hand you have a powerful, well respected icon, American woman who could be president. An on the other hand you have Sarah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then John McCain will make an appearance live via satellite. That is, if he can find somebody to turn on the damn thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She has got a book, a best selling book, she got paid a million dollars for the book called 'Going Rogue.' You think about it, she was Rambo, am I right?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That is the name of her book, Going Rogue. And she got a million dollars for that and she is work on the sequel, 'Going Shopping.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But just -- a word of advice now to Oprah Winfrey, be prepared. Don't underestimate her. Remember how Palin schooled Katie Couric, remember that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We wanted Sarah Palin to be on our program and she decided she was going to be on the Oprah program. I'm beginning to think maybe she doesn't like me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;CNN's Lou Dobbs recently had to call the police because someone fired shots at his home. Dobbs said he didn't see or hear the shooter, but described him as Hispanic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After months of the debate, finally a healthcare reform bill now exists. ... The bill's official title's actually HR-3692. 3692, of course, stands for the year they expect the bill to pass.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new poll from CNN found that more than 70 percent of Americans said that Sarah Palin is not qualified to be president in 2012. When she heard that, she was like, 'Yeah, but that still leaves 50 percent.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tomorrow, of course, Halloween. ... I read today over 600 million pounds of candy will be given away this year...or as Glenn Beck calls that, 'just another Obama socialist giveaway. That's what it is!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;ESPN commentator Steve Phillips has been fired for having an affair with a young woman that he worked with. He has checked himself into a rehab facility for sex addiction. Well, it's pretty serious, too. I understand he's in the John Edwards wing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to a report on Edmunds.com, the...real cost of the 'Cash for Clunkers' program was $24,000 per car. Every car that was traded in cost us, the taxpayers, $24,000. How many would have rather kept your old car, just got a check for 20 grand from the government? Right, huh? It would have been cheaper, exactly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the White House has approved a new plan to pay the Taliban fighters in Afghanistan to switch sides and join the US. ... The program is called 'Moolah for Mullah.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in an interview with 'The New York Times' magazine, President Obama said he was unhappy with all of the criticism he got for taking his wife to New York on a date. Remember that? He said he was just fulfilling a campaign promise he made to his wife. If he was elected, he would take her to New York City for dinner and a play. And he felt all the criticism was unfair. Well, sure, the one campaign promise he fulfilled, and he gets criticized. Exactly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, you know what's interesting? I don't know if you noticed this, but the Obamas are being very candid about their marriage. In the same interview, Michelle Obama said, 'The last thing we want to project is the image of a flawless relationship,' to which Hillary Clinton said, 'I can help you with that.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the government said that the third quarter of the economy grew by 3.5%, or as Fox News reported, it 'failed to grow by 96.5%.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama has approved a new plan to pay members of the Taliban to switch sides and support the United States. ... Apparently he's promised them 72 virgins and full dental coverage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a new interview, President Obama admitted that he has had, quote, 'some bumps in his marriage.' ... After hearing this, Bill Clinton said, 'Bumps, I would kill for bumps.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some bad news for Sarah Palin. ... According to a recent survey, when asked, seven out of 10 people said Sarah Palin is not qualified to be president. ... Even worse, the question was, 'Are you happy with your long distance service?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a really weird story. Political experts say that when former President Clinton traveled to North Korea recently, he may have met with an actor playing Kim Jong-Il, instead of the real guy. It's true. On the bright side, at least now we know what happened to Margaret Cho.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Obamas have the official First Family portrait...hung in the White House. ... I'm telling you, things are starting to look bad for John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's another big slap in the face to me . You know that Sarah Palin, former governor of Alaska? Well, listen to this, guess what? She's appearing on Oprah. ... Can you believe she picked Oprah over me?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin is promoting her new memoir. It's called 'Going Rogue.' Oh, yeah. She was really out there on the edge, wasn't she? Wooooh!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it's a big book. ... It's good to stand on to get to a better book.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The book...comes in regular edition and also large print for former running mates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not only is Sarah Palin Going to be on 'The Oprah Winfrey Show,' but for more publicity, she plans to get loose in a balloon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, it's interesting what former presidents do when they leave office. George W. Bush is now working as a motivational speaker. ... And if you want to be motivated, who better to turn to than the guy who invaded the wrong country and started a depression?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush will also be lecturing on flipping condos.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But...I think George W. Bush will be a great motivational speaker. I mean, look how many people he motivated to vote Democrat. So there you go!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you guys remember when president Obama had a beer with the Harvard professor and the...police officer who arrested him? Well, Henry Louis Gates and James Crowley were spotted this week at a pub in Cambridge, having a drink. So, this is either great news for race relations or those guys are alcoholics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama planted a tree on the North Lawn of the White House this week in a spot where George W. Bush planted one that did not take. Apparently, nobody had the heart to tell Bush that his tree was actually a coat rack.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Next week, President Obama will travel to Wisconsin to discuss his education plan, 'Race to the Top,' not to be confused with Bill Clinton's plan, 'Lose the Top.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, the healthcare bill was introduced yesterday. It's 1,990 pages long and costs $894 billion dollars, or 2.2 million per word. That makes them the most expensive words to come out of Washington since 'mission accomplished.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And finally, Sarah Palin's financial records were made public and it turns out she owns a marketing business involved with services for the elderly. ... I guess that makes sense since last year she helped an old man lose an election.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This weekend for Halloween, President Obama wore chinos, a white button down shirt and a crew neck sweater. Yeah. Apparently, Obama went as the whitest president in the history of the United States.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This weekend in Afghanistan, opposition candidate Abdullah Abdullah dropped out of the run-off presidential election. Yep, Abdullah Abdullah says he wants to spend more time with his wife Marjorie Marjorie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, the country of Kosovo unveiled an 11-foot tall statue of former President Clinton. Yeah. That's right. The Clinton statue is so life-like, it's already been slapped 12 times.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They trick or treat down at the White House. And it's more, I guess it is more, it is more trick-or-treater friendly in this Administration than it used to be the Bush-Cheney Administration. Remember what happened -- the trick-or-treaters would come and then Dick Cheney would turn his wolfhounds loose on the kids.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the kids coming to the White House with their hands out, I mean and those were just the auto company executives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mayor Bloomberg, poor guy is so exhausted. Here's what happened yesterday. Kind of an awkward moment. He is out there campaigning, so tired, here is what he did, he kissed a blintz and ate a baby.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Bloomberg is &quot;running against a guy named Bill Thompson. Bill Thompson, Bill 'I'm going to vote for you' Thompson. And he has no money. His largest contribution was a generous $5 check from Regis.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, how about those Afghanistan elections. You know, they had the first one and they thought well maybe something hincky with the first one. All right, if something is hincky, let's do it again. And now the opposition candidate Abdullah Abdullah has dropped out of the runoff election. He got the idea from watching the Phillies during the World Series.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, no runoff election in Afghanistan. Apparently a second election would be way too expensive to rig.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So Abdullah Abdullah says he is pulling out because he wants to spend more time with his wife, Paula Abdullah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So they've recounted all the votes from the first election in Afghanistan and congratulations to the new president, Al Franken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Abdullah Abdullah may be out of the race, but they say in four years his idiot son will be on the ballot. That would be Abdullah W. Abdullah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here, of course, we celebrate Halloween. In Mexico they call it what? 'Day of the Dead,' where people believe the dead rise and walk the earth again. Or, as folks at ACORN, call it, the 'Voter Registration Day.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the White House on Saturday, the Obama's greeted trick or treaters. They gave them either M&amp;Ms with the presidential seal on them or dried fruit. The dried fruit went to the kids who said their parents worked at Fox News.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This weekend, &quot;we turned the clocks back. Which means Congress had yet another hour not to read the new health care bill before they signed it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a report on CNN today -- this is a report on CNN today, and I quote, 'President Obama is close to formulating a new strategy for Afghanistan.' They say he'll either decide to add more troops, reduce the number of troops or keep the troop levels the same. Good, solid reporting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only opponent to Afghan president Hamid Karzai...has backed out of the planned recount. He's not going to be in the race. He says he wants to spend more time with his family and not get killed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New Jersey Governor Jon Corzine said he's considering leasing the New Jersey turnpike to help raise money for the state. He's going to lease out the New Jersey turnpike. And of course, a lot of people are furious about this. Because, you know, parts of the Jersey turnpike are considered a sacred mob burial ground.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Executives of America's 28 largest banks met with Federal Reserve supervisors to discuss and regulate the banks' pay policies, which is pretty amazing. There's still 28 banks left in this country?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just love Halloween. It's the only time of the year you get to see a Ghostbuster making out with Sarah Palin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A year ago today, Barack Obama was elected president. It's been a year, can you believe that? Yeah. A lot's happened. Yeah. In one short year, Obama's slogan has gone from, 'Yes, we can,' to 'Wow, this is freakin' hard.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Reporters are saying President Obama has been skipping meals lately, and now photographs show he has lost a lot of weight. Folks, if this is true, then maybe Obama really has lost touch with the American people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former President Bush is in Japan, and he was met with protestors carrying signs that said, 'Arrest Bush' and 'Bush is a war criminal.' Yeah. When he saw the signs, Bush said, 'Thanks for making me feel at home. Appreciate it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I kind of wish&quot; Al Gore &quot;had been with us last night to kind of help out with the audience last night because, oh, my goodness. Over the course of the show the climate went from bad to worse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you believe it's been a year since Barack Obama was elected president? Amazing, huh? Well, actually, there's been some changes. His new slogan is now, 'Yes, we can, but don't hold your breath.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, scolded Pakistan leaders for not going after Al Qaeda and just pretending that they didn't see a problem that everyone else in the world could see. Ouch. How about that, huh? Imagine, Hillary Clinton lecturing you on turning a blind eye to a problem that the rest of the world could see.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House has approved a new plan to pay -- they're going to pay members of the Taliban to change sides and support the US. And if it works there, they're going to try it with Fox News.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, the program's got kind of a catchy title. It's called 'Don't ask, don't Taliban.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government says this swine flu vaccine shortage could last through December. Through December. Great. Now I'll go to the mall and see Santa sitting there with a big, red nose, probably from the flu instead of the usual alcoholism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, why is there a swine flu vaccine shortage? You ever notice in this country, we never seem to run out of illegal drugs. You know, we should pay the guys who make crystal meth to start making this stuff.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In his first year in office, President Obama has traveled to 16 foreign countries, more than any other president in history. Bush only traveled to 11, but most of those were just different parts from the 'it's a small world' ride.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people have been noticing that president Obama is getting very skinny. Have you noticed this? ... And he is thin. If it wasn't for his ears he'd weigh less than 100 pounds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Insiders say that Obama has been too busy to eat, which is a problem President Clinton never seemed to have.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Saturday night, the President and Mrs. Obama had a couple thousand kids at the White House and instead of candy, they gave out dried fruit. That's great.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a new book that's coming out about Sarah Palin. And the book contains a copy of the speech she would have given if John McCain had won and she had became vice president. Yeah. The speech is entitled, 'Uh-oh.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big losses for the Democrats in the elections. Here's how bad it was for the Democrats-- earlier today, the Democratic Party was begging Rush Limbaugh for pain killers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bad year for Democrats right now. All the Democrats have left is the presidency, both houses of Congress, and all of Hollywood. That's all they have.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Next February, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush will be debate, at Radio City Music Hall. I'm looking forward to that line of high-kicking Secret Service agents.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Clinton and Bush are debating, and, honestly, think about it, what is more exciting than a presidential debate that doesn't count, if you think about it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One year ago today, ladies and gentlemen, Barack Obama was elected president, one year ago today. One year later, we're still in Iraq. We're still in Afghanistan. But, you know, at least we got rid of Paula Abdul.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the Democratic Party has a new slogan. 'What happened?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, political experts are calling this his worst setback since he tried that bowling thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, congratulations to New York city mayor Michael Bloomberg on the purchase of his third term.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bloomberg spent $100 million to get re-elected. Do you realize that is the most money ever spent on a New Yorker that's not playing for the Yankees?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bloomberg &quot;was limited to just two terms, but he changed the law so he could run again and be in power another four years. And today, Arnold Schwarzenegger said ? 'You can do that? How do you do that? Why can't I do that here?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some pictures of President Obama posted on the internet seem to show the President looking very thin. I get all that all the time, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, they say he looks too thin, but White House docs say not to worry, Barack Obama's one of those guys who can eat whatever he wants and still not gain weight. Yet another reason for Rush Limbaugh to hate him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over in Washington, President Obama called and congratulated Republican Bob McDonnell today after he won the governorship in Virginia. Obama then moved Virginia to the bottom of the swine flu vaccine waiting list.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House says that President Obama did not watch the election results the other night. He watched the Chicago Bulls instead. So at least one of his teams won.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is amazing, you guys. A new report found that there are 237 millionaires in Congress. Some of that is oil money, some of it is from family money, but mostly it's just old-fashioned bribes.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Labor Department today announced that unemployment has reached a 26-year high. ... Economists blame most of it on Jon and Kate and the plus eight losing their TV show. That's ten jobs right there.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You sound like a bunch of people who heard they just got free health care.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, on Saturday night the House narrowly passed the healthcare bill. They said the reason it passed was because Nancy Pelosi didn't blink. But -- she hasn't blinked since what, '82?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, to win passage for this healthcare bill, President Obama went up to Capitol Hill and personally lobbied some of the wavering congressman. And of course, the health insurance industry, they were very upset. You know, they said they bought and paid for these congressmen, he has no right to go up to them and talk to them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now it gets tricky because the bill goes to the Senate, where Senator Lindsey Graham vowed it would be dead on arrival. That's what he said. In fact, right now, Graham is leading a Southern white coalition against the bill called the Graham Crackers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was reported today 237 members of Congress are millionaires. Almost half of Congress are millionaires. Isn't that unbelievable? So, apparently, Congress is pretty good at managing their own money, it's just our money they suck at managing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Secret Service has &quot;to protect the President now on a budget. In fact, like, after 5:00, you know the President just wears a life alert.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The other day in Wisconsin, Sarah Palin gave a speech, and the crowd was searched to make sure there were no cameras. That's right. Yeah, according to experts, Palin subscribes to the primitive belief that cameras will 'steal her crazy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember the Congressman, William Jefferson, who the FBI caught with $90,000 in bribe money in his freezer? Well, he was convicted of 11 counts of bribery and corruption. Prosecutors asked for the harshest prison sentence ever handed down for a member of Congress. Something like 30 years. The Congressman is saying -- he said he still did nothing wrong. He claims he just fell in with the wrong crowd -- Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama, he said that he would be happy to travel, more than happy to travel to Copenhagen in December for the global climate conference, if his presence would make a difference.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fox News is criticizing President Obama because he bowed to the Japanese emperor, and earlier he got in trouble with bowing to the Saudi king. See, that never would happen with President Bush. He only bowed to Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our top story tonight: a long-awaited development in our war on terror. 'After eight years of delay, those allegedly responsible for the attacks of September the 11th will finally face justice. .. 'They will be brought to New York...to answer for their alleged crimes in a courthouse just blocks away from where the Twin Towers once stood.' ... So we're going to go with living up to our nation's highest ideals. Yeah, I was hoping we were going to go a little more Old Testament, quite frankly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama is currently in the middle of a presidential tour of the mysterious Orient. And already he has brought great shame upon us. ... 'The President of the United States had a very deep bow toward the emperor of Japan.' ... Folks, I've said it a million times: If you want to look strong, you don't bow to a foreign leader. You kiss him on the cheek and hold his hand. Okay? That looks strong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush 41 knew that the only time you bow to a Japanese prime minister is when you're puking on his shoes.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama arrived in China yesterday. And to foster the spirit of good will, he wore the traditional clothes made by the children of China. You know, L.L. Bean, J. Crew, Banana Republic, Nike, Reebok.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And experts now say China wants a bigger role in world events. Really? What, being our landlord is not enough now?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Liz Cheney said on Fox News that her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, should run for president in 2012. In fact, that's apparently in the Mayan calendar too, you know. Cheney becomes president, and then the whole world ends. That's exactly what happens.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, you know what happened on this day in 1973? Richard Nixon uttered his famous line, 'I am not a crook.' That's back when being a crook could actually hurt a politician's career. See, now it's just part of the job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know where President Obama is right now? In China. Today he was over there. They're touring him around. He got to see where they keep all our money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama met with the Chinese leaders. They complained about the US economy. And why not? ... Obama complained about leaky takeout cartons.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama and the Chinese president pledged to work together on climate change. Then they drove off in their Hummer motorcades.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who was on Oprah the other day was Sarah Palin, former governor of Alaska. ... The high point was when the Governor shot a cigarette out of Oprah's mouth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin admitted she once got a D in a college course. I looked it up. I think the course was called 'Being Vice President.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a great day for America...and a great day for one of our loveliest Americans, Sarah Palin. Her long-awaited book, 'Going Rogue,' hit bookstores today. ... Last night, Sarah did a tell-all interview with Barbara Walters. I watched, but I couldn't understand what either one was saying. ...'Did you cwy when you wost the election?' 'You betcha.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin's book is supposedly full of shocking revelations. Some of it even surprised John McCain. 'I ran for president?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama's nine-day trip to Asia is in full swing. ... Presidential trips like this require a ton of planning. The State Department briefs the President, the Air Force clears the airspace, and the Secret Service leaves dog food out for Joe Biden. Then everybody heads out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Right now President Obama is meeting with top Chinese officials. The American-Chinese relationship has changed in the past couple of years, because we used to be the world's only superpower, standing head and shoulders above other nations. We were like Alec Baldwin towering over all the other Baldwins.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now things are different. The financial crisis has knocked us down a few pegs. ... They've got more than a billion people. If we're going to battle the Chinese for global supremacy, we're going to need a lot more octomoms.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, President Obama today met with Chinese leader Hu Jintao. But in China, the first name is actually the surname, so he's known as President Hu. So of course, every time he meets an English-speaking leader, it's like the Abbott and Costello routine. 'Sir, Hu's here.' 'Who's here to see me?' 'That's what I'm telling you. Hu.' 'What are you talking about?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President of the United States is in China tonight. This is big. The Chinese president entertained President Obama by having a military band play 'I Just Called To Say I Love You' and 'We Are The World.' ... What I want to know is how did the Chinese president get hold of my college record collection?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a big deal, though. Chinese President Hu Jintao had dinner with President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. ... Experts say that the relations between the two remain icy but that Obama and Jintao get along great.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, some critics are saying President Obama made a faux pas in greeting the emperor of Japan because Obama did the traditional bow but mixed in a handshake. ... And to make matters worse, Obama then tried to get out of that with an awkward end of a blind date half hug.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In her new book, 'Going Rogue,' Sarah Palin says she doesn't like vegetarians. ... Palin says all vegetarians should go back to Vegetaria, where they came from.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Sarah Palin's new book, she says when she first laid eyes on her future husband, she said out loud, 'Thank you, God,'...which is the same thing the Democrats said when they first laid eyes on Sarah Palin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the President is in China now. And he had 71 cars in his motorcade drive from the airport to Beijing. ... There's one car for the President, two for Secret Service and then 68 for Obama's advisers on the environment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I mean, it was all the way fine until the 34th car drove through the yellow light and left everyone else behind. It was like, 'Hey, we don't know where we're going! We're in China, man!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Seventy-one cars. ... Somewhere in the world, Al Gore shed a single tear.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They didn't need 71 cars. I mean, trust me. I've been to China. They could fit nine guys on a scooter and still have room for a crate of fish. They got it handled over there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While he was there, Obama toured the Forbidden City, also known as the Imperial Palace. Bill Clinton once visited the Forbidden City and the Imperial Palace. But they were both strip clubs in Vegas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you see guys see 'Oprah' yesterday. Sarah Palin was on it. Sarah Palin said that running for president in 2012 is not on her radar screen right now, which was really, really, really upsetting for Democrats.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You guys hear this? 'The Oxford Dictionary' declared that the 2009 word of the year is 'unfriend.' To unfriend means to completely delete somebody you don't like from your life, or as CNN calls it, 'Lou Dobbs them.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin's new book came out today. ... Well, she did 'Oprah' yesterday. She did 'GMA' this morning. ... Having her out on the road is a nice break if you are a moose in Alaska.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She said she was super excited to meet Oprah and also to hug a black person for the very first time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People see her as a candidate in 2012. Some people have started giving money to her campaign. For instance, she just received a very generous check from Barack Obama to run.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Her book is number one on Amazon.com right now. ... Stephen King actually has the number two book. Very scary new book called 'Sarah Palin Becomes President.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama, our president, was in Beijing today for summit meetings and Chinese food. On Saturday, he was in Japan. He met with the Japanese emperor and empress, and in doing so, upset some conservatives because he bowed when he met them. The GOP said that's sends a bad message to the world, and they're demanding that next time, Obama sweep the leg.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The State Department says he was just following protocol and showing respect to local customs. It's the same reason he pulled the Canadian prime minister's jersey over his head and punched him with the one hand. They like hockey there. It's what they do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the people most bothered by Obama's bow was former Vice President Dick Cheney. He said no American president should bow to anyone. Dick's been unusually feisty lately. He's like that when he gets a fresh battery in his pacemaker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But you know, President Bush never bowed to any foreign leaders. He...just held hands with them and also he kissed them...and then they shared a bunk bed. But that was different. That was for oil.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Vice President... holding down the homeland while his boss, President Barack Obama journeys to the Far East, visiting Japan, Singapore, South Korea and the most critical phase of the trip, China, where he will hopefully get a chance to visit with our money.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama winding up his Asian tour this week. ... There's a switch. Something American in China. You never see that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday, while speaking in Beijing at the Great Hall of the People, President Obama paid tribute to China for its economic successes. And you know something: it's amazing what can be accomplished with child slave labor. It's fantastic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Postal Service announced last week the Post Office lost $3.8 billion last year. ... I've got a good idea. Let's put the government in charge of healthcare! Fantastic idea!&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And last night in New York, for the third time in two weeks, Vice President Joe Biden's motorcade was involved in a traffic accident. ... Remember the old days when the Vice President would just shoot you?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No wonder they want universal healthcare.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Congress now looking at a possible amendment to a bill that would allow passengers to check guns on Amtrak. That's amazing, isn't it? They figured out a way to make Amtrak even more dangerous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Boston Teachers Union is stopping 200 teachers from getting their bonuses for good job performance. The union says teachers, good and bad, should all get bonuses. Even the Obama Administration is calling this socialism.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. First question: 'Sup?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Showed up wearing one of Michelle's halter tops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Interview split into domestic issues, foreign affairs and one round of bare-knuckle boxing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Promoted Obama's new book about his life as a sassy Alaska hockey mom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Mostly about Shakira's awesome new 'She Wolf' video.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Only thing they could agree on is that Glenn Beck is a load.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big news here in New York City, that awful guy, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed ? you know this guy? Terrorist mastermind, been down in Guantanamo Bay for seven years, bringing him to New York City, and he's going to be on trial here in New York City. Now, the good news is it should be pretty entertaining because Steve Martin and Alec Baldwin are hosting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new poll shows that President Obama's approval rate is now under 50%. 'Well, welcome to the club,' I said.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House has announced that they no longer recognize Fox as a news organization...which puts them about eight years behind the rest of us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see any of the Sarah Palin on the Oprah show? Wow. She...said that she disagrees with Barack Obama getting the Nobel Peace Prize. She said she thought it was premature and she said other world leaders, other foreign dignitaries, probably more deserving of that award. Of course, she couldn't name any, but still.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, President Obama took a tour of the Great Wall of China. He said it was, quote, 'magical'...as opposed to two years ago, when former President Bush stood at the exact same spot and said, 'Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former Vice President Dick Cheney is in the news. ... Cheney slammed President Obama for bowing before the emperor of Japan. ... Cheney said, 'Come on, it's not like he's the CEO of Exxon.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today in Congress -- this is big -- 91-year-old Senator Robert Byrd...set a record for the longest time served in congressional history. ... During his time in office, Byrd has passed over 800 bills and 600 kidney stones.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been announced that President Obama's first state dinner at the White House is going to be held in honor of the prime minister of India. ... Guests are encouraged to wear black tie and to bring any laptops with tech problems.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin is still dominating the news here. Last night, she was in an interview with Barbara Walters. She was asked to rate Obama's performance as a president on a scale of 1 to 10. And Palin was like, 'Oh, that's easy, F.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Obama visited the Great Wall of China. He said, 'It's magical. It reminds you of the sweep of history.' When George Bush visited, he said, 'It's magical. It reminds you of something Spider-Man would love to climb.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a new interview, President Obama said that the people could lose confidence in the US economy if our debt continues to grow. And Americans were like, 'Uh, way ahead of you, dude.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm Jimmy. I'm the host of this show. Don't worry. I got the whole night planned out. We're going to have drinks, we're going to have appetizers, and then we're going to roast a moose and split it up between us. .... I got the recipe out of the new Sarah Palin book.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin's new book, 'Going Rogue,' came out yesterday. ... It's getting a lot of attention, primarily because she spends a lot of the book settling scores with the media, the political elite, she's angry at the weather for raining on her once.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And she goes after vegetarians, too. She asks, 'If God had not intended for us to eat animals, how come he made them out of meat?' It's a really good question. Hey, wait a second. People are made out of meat, too! And so are cocker spaniels. I think the lesson is, don't go to Sarah Palin's house for Thanksgiving dinner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She believes that women are held to a higher standard than men. She quotes Margaret Thatcher, who said, 'If you want something done, ask a woman.' I guess that's why she asked a woman to write the book for her.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Washington, DC, today, the Senate paid tribute to West Virginia Senator Robert Byrd, who officially became the longest serving lawmaker in the history of Congress. He turns 92 on Friday. He's still senating. His fellow senators honored him on the Senate floor. They were strongly urged to keep speeches brief, just in case.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What is it about Sarah Palin that makes the right in this country feel as though they've been sprinkled with angel dust and the left in this country feel as though they've smoked something laced with angel dust?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin has a 400-page book. It can really do some damage when you throw it at a wolf from a helicopter.&quot;</SPAN></P>

And the time that he's in New York City, he's going to be very busy. Monday, for example ? Monday morning ? he'll be on the 'Today Show,' singing 'I Dreamed a Dream.' Very busy schedule.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's not coming on this show, apparently because of a joke I made about his daughter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But listen to this. What a great idea. The CIA has a plan now, they're going to grab Osama bin Laden when he shows up for jury duty. They're going to get him, cuff him, outta here!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's great news. The United States Senate unveiled its healthcare bill. Listen to this: $849 billion, 2,000 pages. Whooo! Sounds like a Donald trump prenup.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody reading the 'Going Rogue' book, the Sarah Palin memoir? ... Remember the interview she did with Katie Couric before the election and it was confusing and clumsy. Well, in the book, Sarah Palin says that she felt ambushed when Katie Couric asked her what newspapers she read. ... This coming from a woman who hunts wolves from a helicopter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin signed copies ? she's out on a massive book tour. This is a huge bestseller. She was at Barnes &amp; Noble today and she actually had to take a break because she got a cramp in her wig.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Then she got a sore hand from signing so many book copies. ... She had to call Rush Limbaugh to get some OxyContin, and that put her right where she wanted to be.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama has lifted his ban on doing interviews with Fox News. ... Well, yesterday, President Obama was interviewed by a reporter from Fox News. Yeah. And you could tell the reporter was from Fox News because the first question was, 'How do you think you're doing as president on a scale from minus one to minus ten?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, President Obama was in South Korea today, discussing what to do about Iran's nuclear ambitions. And he said he plans to, quote, 'indicate our seriousness to Iran.' ... Obama plans to indicate our seriousness by having our next message to Iran read aloud by James Earl Jones.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, Kellogg's announced that due to a problem at the factory this year, there's going to be a nationwide shortage of Eggo waffles. ... The terror alert has been raised to orange.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama said he probably won't read Sarah Palin's new book, because she'll sell enough copies without him. Meanwhile, President Bush said he probably won't read Sarah Palin's book, because it's a book.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Senate unveiled its own version of the healthcare bill yesterday. It will cost $849 billion and cover 31 million Americans. It's so exciting. That means we're...close to having that bill voted on by the Senate, then combined with the bill in House, then re-voted on again by both houses and then signed into law, which will take effect in three years. Exciting, right?!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if you guys know this, but tomorrow is Vice President Joe Biden's 67th birthday. ... Whenever he gets a birthday cake, he doesn't blow out the candles, he just talks and talks until the candles decide to put themselves out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The reason our Speidi senses are tingling, Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt will be here&quot; to &quot;talk about their new book. It is ? I tell ya; it's a major week for literature. Heidi and Spencer, Sarah Palin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Sarah Palin tour made its top in Noblesville, Indiana, today. Her book, 'Going Rogue,' is still at the top of Amazon's best seller list, which is rare for a work of fiction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a waffle shortage on the way. Breakfast experts are predicting a shortage in the year 2010 after a flood damaged the Eggo factory. For real. They're saying that there's going to be a shortfall that's going to hit grocery stores somewhere around February. See now, if President Bush were still in charge, we'd just invade Belgium and take their waffles, but we can't do that anymore and now we're going to have to suffer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now that we've decided to try Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in Manhattan,&quot; it &quot;sounds like...congressmen are saying that we must protect the rule of law by not exercising it. Or, to put it another way, all right, have your trial by jury, but don't say we didn't warn you. 'If I were a terrorist outside the United States and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was going on trial in New York, I'd say, 'Why don't I find the judge's cousin. Why don't I find the bailiff's sister? Why don't I find the jailer's brother? And I'll capture them and hold them for ransom until Khalid Sheikh Mohammed is released.' Why don't you shut the hell up? What are you doing? Why are you telling them that? 'Hey, uh, all I'm saying is, you know what I would do if I were a terrorist? I'd get like four or five Good Humor trucks, you know what I mean? Because everybody loves ice cream. And I'd drive 'em down to the courthouse, but instead of ice cream, I'd pack 'em full of crocodiles. ... When the court takes a break, the bailiff comes out for some Dippin' Dots. ... Boom! Crocodiles! The terrorists win.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, I warned you that once the Democrats took control of Congress, the legislature would be on a slippery slope to legislating. Well, yesterday they proved me right when Harry Reid presented the Senate's version of the healthcare bill. It's 2,074 pages, in honor of the year in which they'll pass it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The official White House Christmas tree was unveiled today on the South Lawn. Actually, it turned out to be a regular tree, but it snuck in through the White House security.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Secret Service is in a lot of hot water after what happened. ... But I think give the Secret Service a break. ..... When the Secret Service heard there was a crazy couple in White House, they just assumed it was the Bidens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This Friday, the official Christmas tree was delivered to the White House. ... Unfortunately, the Secret Service had already let in three other trees that claimed they were on the list.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course...you've been hearing about them, the couple who crashed the White House state dinner. They were supposed to be on 'Larry King Live' tonight, but they canceled their appearance. ... Apparently, they didn't feel right showing up to a place where they were actually invited.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a new children's book that's coming out that features Sarah Palin as a hero. ... I don't want to give away the ending, but we finally find out who shot Bambi's mother.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A top Iranian official says Iran had no intention of building new nuclear facilities until they were recently criticized by the UN. ... It's all a part of the country's official motto, 'Iran, we're 5 years old!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody's talking about the party crashers at Obama's state dinner. Amateur hour at the White House. I mean, who lets Joe Biden in? And all this just to get on 'The Real Housewives of Delaware.' Hope it was worth it, Joe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just this weekend, the UN Climate Change Conference will start in Copenhagen, Denmark, where President Obama and 64 other world leaders will try to do what the UN has never done before: Accomplish something.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, sure, there have been climate summits before. Remember Kyoto? Me neither, thanks to George W. Bush. He pulled out of the Kyoto climate treaty, a move which his own head of the EPA described like this: 'The way it happened was the equivalent to flipping the bird, frankly, to the rest of the world.' Fun fact: If you pollute enough, the birds flip themselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But there is even more at stake here, folks. ... 'So, will the President sign away America's sovereignty?' 'The big UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen in December could mean the end of US sovereignty.' Do you hear that? They're going to take our sovereignty away, I assume from the Chinese because I think we hocked it last year for rent money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, it is possible that no agreement will be reached in Copenhagen, making Obama not only a totalitarian dictator but a failure. That's right folks. He will be Adolf Carter!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, are you going to Copenhagen for the climate summit? Neither am I, but at the upcoming climate summit in Copenhagen ? this is true -- you can shake Al Gore's hand for 1,200 bucks. For an extra 50, he'll wipe the gravy off first.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is true. In Baghdad, there's an Iraqi TV network called the 'Saddam Channel.' ... They've gone off the air after only three days. Three days! It's like NBC or something.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a shame, though, because I was looking forward to...that sitcom, 'The New Adventures of Old Jihad.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama's speech to the nation was earlier tonight. ... All the networks showed it. NBC preempted Jay Leno's show. It was his Christmas special as well, I think: 'The Chin That Stole Christmas.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;ABC had to postpone 'The Charlie Brown Christmas Special' tonight. And their switchboard was lit up with complaints. At least I think they were complaints. All the calls were like, 'Wah-wah wah-wah.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Secret Service just announced that due to that couple crashing the White House state dinner last week, they will change some of their screening policies. ... For example, the password to get into the White House will no longer be, 'Seriously, they said we could come.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some people are upset about President Obama's primetime speech tonight because it bumped ABC's airing of 'A Charlie Brown Christmas,'&quot; or &quot;as Fox News reported it, 'Obama ruins Christmas for a depressed bald kid.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After months of deliberation, our president, President Obama, tonight revealed his much anticipated plans for Afghanistan. Turns out he's decided to pave it over and make a Wal-Mart out of it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking from West Point, New York, the President announced he will send 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan over the next six months and 2,000 additional troops to Tiger Woods' mansion in Orlando. Peacekeeping forces.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Afghanistan is strategically important to the United States because they control, like, 90% of the world's supply of rubble, and we need that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congratulations, I want to say, to former President Bill and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Their daughter, Chelsea, got engaged over the weekend. You know...when you have to decide whether or not to invite the bride's father to the bachelor party? That's going to be a tough call.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Chelsea will marry her longtime boyfriend, investment banker Marc Mezvinsky. She must really love him, because Chelsea Mezvinsky doesn't exactly roll off the tongue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'A hacker in England got hold of e-mails between leading scientists which skeptics say show a clear effort to raise fears about global warming and hide evidence against it.' ... Poor Al Gore. Global warming completely debunked via the very Internet you invented. Oh...the irony.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, for months now, I've been criticizing President Obama for dithering about what to do in Afghanistan. Well, tonight he announced that he will be sending in 30,000 more troops. I thought the speech was good, the plan was clear, and his commitment was resolute. Luckily, Fox News' chief military haircut Glenn Beck set me straight. ... 'If the commanders say, 'I need between 40,' and what is it, 80,000 new troops, 'and I need them...now,' you do what your military advisors ask for on the ground. Who is the President? He can now look at what the generals are saying and say, 'Nah, you know, I think I know better.&quot; Yeah! Who is the President? Obama is acting like some kind of chief who is commander of the armed forces.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not just war, folks. I have long been a critic of Obama's stimulus package. It's just a government handout for make-work projects. I mean, do we really need bridges? The Dukes of Hazzard have no problem jumping rivers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But now, I must admit, the stimulus is making an impact, starting with the government's Recovery.gov website, which tracks how much money is spent and how many jobs are created in each congressional district. Joe Biden explained it. 'We've got a new modern website that's going to blow you away.' One detail that blew me away? That the site cost ' $18 million' dollars. Now...true, you can make a website for $18 but this one has so many great things to click and track, you could easily spend the entire day on this site, since there's a good chance you don't have a job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But this site...does have one amazing feature. ... 'The website, for example, says 30 jobs were created and over $700,000 spent in Arizona's 15th congressional district. The problem? The state has only eight congressional districts.' That's right. The stimulus package isn't just creating jobs, it's creating congressional districts out of thin air.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So far, it's created over 440 of them in '50 states, four territories,' and the Washington, DC, area, which may be the closest DC residents will ever get to a vote in Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This Tiger Woods thing has had an effect on a lot of people. In fact, earlier today, Elizabeth Edwards went out and bought a new set of golf clubs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama last night ordered 30,000 more troops in Afghanistan to fight the Taliban, but on an 18-month timetable. In a related story, the Taliban announced they are on a 19-month timetable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The good news, Obama said he expects to start bringing our troops home in two years. ... The bad news, Bush said the same thing seven years ago.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama gave his speech last night at West Point. He was going to give it at the White House, but he wanted some place with better security.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what we should do? Get rid of the Secret Service, bring in some...nightclub bouncers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But this is serious, because that couple who crashed the White House state dinner ended up meeting the President. Did you see that? There's a photo of them meeting face-to-face with President Obama, which is amazing when you realize that even Fox News had not met face-to-face with President Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And 'The Washington Post' suggested today that this party-crashing couple may have a long history of deceiving people. Well, no wonder they fit in at the White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A group has now filed papers to nominate Dick Cheney to run for president of the United States in 2012. ... You may have heard of the group, Halliburton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And new reports on Sarah Palin's 'Going Rogue' bus tour. They say she's been traveling on private planes to various stops and then just hops in the bus at the local town. ... So, let's see what you got. You have Sarah Palin, who's no longer governor, who's promoting a book she didn't actually write by going on a bus tour which is not really a bus. Her big complaint? Politicians who aren't real.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I watched Oprah interview Sarah Palin a couple weeks ago. Spent a whole hour talking to her. And I realized, if John McCain had done that, we never would've heard of Sarah Palin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody's talking about President Obama's speech last night. ... He's sending 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan. Right now, in Scandinavia, the Nobel Committee is really rethinking the whole peace prize.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, the good news is the first people Obama sends to Afghanistan is those White House party crashers, so it's not all bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, President Obama gave a speech at West Point. ... Right in the middle, they cut to a cadet who was sleeping. .... That cadet was immediately assigned to work security at the next White House state dinner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, Fox commentator Bill O'Reilly said that President Obama's speech was 'no Gettysburg address.' ... When he heard this, Larry King said, 'How would you know? I don't remember seeing you there.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Time' magazine plans to announce its 'Person of the Year' next week. And top contenders include President Obama and Steve Jobs. ... The other top contender? The one guy who still reads 'Time' magazine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is interesting. A list of this year's 15 most commonly used words has been released. And it includes H1N1, deficit, and healthcare. ... Not making the list this year, Chrysler-mania.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We begin tonight in 2007. A war in Iraq was going badly, so President Bush proposed a bold new strategy, a surge of nearly 30,000 troops. Flash forward, present day, the war in Iraq seems to have stabilized, but the war in Afghanistan is going badly. This time, the problem will be tackled by a bold new leader with the audacity to change hope into what we were waiting for, which -- yes we can! What shall his answer be? 'I have determined that it is in our vital national interest to send an additional 30,000 US troops to Afghanistan.' What the ? 30? What, is 30,000 troops the military equivalent of two Advil? ... 'Thirty thousand troops. If it doesn't work, call my service.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unless, they've gotten to him. Maybe he's giving the same surge speech that Bush gave. No, that's ? that's crazy, Jon. That can't be happening. If that were the case, he would open with some type of 9/11 reference. 'On September 11, 2001, 19 men hijacked four airplanes and used them to murder nearly 3,000 people.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All right. We're almost home. All you need now to fill out your Bush card is a not so subtle Freudian gaffe. 'Today, after extraordinary costs, we are bringing the Iraq war to an irresponsible end.' Irresponsible end?! ... How are you going to sell healthcare. 'As far as my healthcare plan, all your doctors and hearses will be paid for. Ah! I meant nurses!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight, Barack Obama sends 30,000 troops into Afghanistan. And for some reason, Tiger Woods volunteers to go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, there was another disturbing program on last night: Barack Obama's reality show, 'So You Think You Can President?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After three months of will he or won't he, the President went on all the major networks, and NBC, to finally reveal what he's going to do about Afghanistan. And for critics who say Americans haven't sacrificed for these wars, well they have now. Because last night, the President's speech actually preempted the annual showing of 'A Charlie Brown Christmas.' Good grief! Literally, a war on Christmas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you notice how Obama did not preempt 'A Garfield Ramadan.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, folks, I have to agree, the President's performance was terrible. He completely underplayed the money line. 'I have determined that it is in our vital national interest to send an additional 30,000 US troops to Afghanistan.' Hello! How about a little zazz? It's almost as if he's not super-pumped to put 30,000 more young Americans in harm's way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But even...more than passion, folks, Obama's speech was missing a certain je ne sais word. ... 'We heard a lot more about why we should leave Afghanistan than why we need to win in Afghanistan.' 'From the 4,581 words in his speech, one word was missing. That word was win.' 'I want to hear him say, 'Let's win,' which is what George Bush said.' Yeah, do as George Bush said, not as he didn't do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, before all you liberals out there say, 'This is just Fox News,' wrong! Every other major media outlet owned by Rupert Murdoch noticed it, too. Okay, like 'The New York Post,' okay. Okay, it says right here, '30,000 troops and ONE' word missing. Of course, Murdoch is an Australian, so that missing word might be dingo. Didgeridoo?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And how, how folks, are the troops supposed to know what to do if Obama doesn't say the word win. They might think we're supposed to lose or draw.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it wasn't just what Obama didn't say, folks, it's what he did say. 'I have determined that it is in our vital national interest to send an additional 30,000 US troops to Afghanistan. After 18 months, our troops will begin to come home.' Eighteen months?! You can't pull out in 18 months. We're talking about soldiers, not governors of Alaska.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama and the Democratic majority in Congress are now assembling a new jobs package. The area with the most job openings? White House security.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, how is this for nerve? That White House party crashing&quot; couple &quot;refused an invitation to testify before Congress today. ... Unbelievable. The one thing they actually get invited to, they don't show up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, let's see. I'm trying to...sum up President Obama's first 11 months in office. He gave billions to Wall Street, cracked down on illegal immigrants getting healthcare, sending 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan. You know something? He may go down in history as our greatest Republican president ever.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, America's last living...World War I veteran -- a man named Frank Buckles, 108 years old -- he said he would like to see a memorial in Washington, DC. You know, when he gets back from Afghanistan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's a very bizarre story. People act strangely this time of year. In Toledo, Ohio, a man attacked a Salvation Army bell ringer, grabbed his red kettle, threw it in the back of his truck, yelled, 'I hate Christmas,' and drove off. Here's my question. What is Dick Cheney doing in Toledo, Ohio?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Police in Texas seized thousands&quot; of ecstasy &quot;tablets with pictures of Obama's face on them. ... Drug dealers chose Obama because the pills make you feel hope and change and then send you off to a far away place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been reported that President Obama's speech on Tuesday about Afghanistan helped give NBC its best ratings in a long time. ... So look out this spring for NBC's new shows, 'Afghanistan's Got Talent,' Law &amp; Order: Kabul,' and 'The Tonight Show with Hamid O'Karzai.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone now is worried about global warming. Even former Hummer owners are worried. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who, as you may recall, was cast as governor of California in what's turned out to be the most expensive disaster movie of all time, is working with Google on a website to illustrate the potentially disastrous effects of climate change. 'But I think the one thing you should know, no matter how many uncertainties there are, California always will be back. Californians always say, &quot;I'll be back.&quot; Okay.' ... No, we don't. You always say that. No one else does.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As though things couldn't get any more awkward for Tiger Woods right now, he, this -- here's an unhappy coincidence from next month's issue of 'Golf Digest.' 'Check out the January issue of 'Golf Digest' magazine. It features a picture of Tiger Woods as President Obama's caddie. The cover story is titled '10 Tips Obama Can Take From Tiger.' Yeah, I don't think Obama is going to be taking any tips from Tiger.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, controversy from Montana Senator Max Baucus after he admitted he was having a romantic relationship with a woman he nominated for US attorney. He says they were both separated at the time, and they started having the relationship, and then...he nominated her. See, this is under the 'Give a Job, Get a Job' program.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Honestly, how many of you -- the Salahis. They had a big state dinner for the guy and all of a sudden there's a lovely young couple there. Nobody has any idea who they are. 'Oh, hello. How do you do, nice to see you.' It's the Salahis -- nobody knows who they are, nobody cares who they are, they weren't invited, nobody wants them there. Since 1980, there have been 91 breaches of security at the White House. Well, 92 if you count George Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the CIA, Osama bin Laden periodically sneaks into Afghanistan. Well, a guy's got to have fun! You know what I mean? What happens in Kabul stays in Kabul.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama. Did you hear about this? He spoke at a town hall last week and a student stood up and asked him if he would consider legalizing drugs to stimulate the economy. ... Unfortunately, the student's follow-up question was, 'Do you ever hear colors?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Iowa, a large group of people waited outside a Sarah Palin book signing to urge her to run for president in 2012. ... The large group of people was known as the Iowa Democratic Party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, are you guys excited about the UN climate change conference in Copenhagen? Yeah! Starting today, President Obama said the US can reduce carbon emissions by 17% by the year 2020. ... Then he was like, 'Of course, by then, I'll be out of office, so I can promise anything I want. By 2020, a free Xbox for every man, woman and child. By 2040, a Megan Fox clone for every dude. Not my problem, call President Timberlake.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fifteen thousand people talking about climate change for two weeks. It's basically Al Gore's version of Ozzfest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While speaking about Bruce Springsteen at the Kennedy Center last night, President Obama said, 'I'm the President, but he's the Boss.' And then Biden was like, 'Then who the hell is Tony Danza?!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I actually spent a little time this weekend down in our nation's capital, or as it's known during the Obama Administration, 'Das Kapital.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was down there for the Kennedy Center Honors. I went to the White House for a reception. Uh, invited.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I do want to thank last week's interlopers, the Salahis, for the added security we all had to go through.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You remember when Barack Obama first got in office he had a very clear vision of how healthcare was to proceed. 'I'm confident that both the House and the Senate are going to produce a bill before the August recess.' Well, actually ? this is good. I think you're on schedule to hit that deadline. You've...got eight more months and they've already gotten a -- oh, last, last August. Uh, that...will be tough to hit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the House has a bill. How is the Senate's coming? 'Senate showdown take two. Lawmakers return to Capitol Hill for yet another marathon weekend debate on healthcare reform.' 'A rare weekend session.' 'Lawmakers plan to work through the weekend with no end in sight.' No end in sight? It's the weekend. I believe the end in sight is called Monday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You will remember, last week, I reported on Joe Biden's Recovery.gov website, which cost the taxpayers ' $18 million.' I assume they went to GoDaddy.com, paid the $18 registration fee, and just fell asleep with their finger on the zero.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now I nailed this website for claiming Obama's stimulus package created jobs in 440 congressional districts that do not exist. ... And I revealed a dark secret about a certain White House aide. &quot;Joe Biden's special adviser even claims, 'some of the mistakes are frustrating typos and coding errors that don't undermine information at the heart of the data.' But how can we trust that? The adviser's name is 'G. Edward DeSeve.&quot; Well, speaking at the National Press Club last Thursday, Mr. DeSeve struck back. 'Just two days ago, I'm told-- because I don't have cable TV and I don't stay up late' ? loser ? 'I'm told that I was called out by Stefan Colburt, I was called out as being a malefactor in oversight and execution of' the 'stimulus. Not only did he call me out, but he perverted the pronunciation of my name.' You caught me! I'm a pervert with a pronunciation kink.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, I hope it hurt you as much as you hurt me by calling me Stefan Colburt. Apparently, your name is not pronounced 'G. Edward Deceive,' so from now on I will refer to you by your initials only -- G.E.D. -- which, considering you spent $18 million on a website might be your highest level of education.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And let's -- no, no, he deserves it! Let's cut ? don't pity him! Let's cut the bull, G.E.D.! You're just steamed because I nailed you. ... And neither Stephen Colbert nor Stefan Colburt back down. I will fight you, anywhere in America. Let's say, Rhode Island's 65th district. I'll meet you on the corner of Sesame Street and Electric Avenue, at 13 o'clock, February 30th. Be there or you're a coward.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, remember that...incident last week with the uninvited guests sneaking into the White House? Well, three Secret Service officers have now been put on administrative leave after that security breach. ... But you know something? The White House should have seen this coming. You know what those three guys were doing before White House security? Border guards. Yeah, so, they should have known.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and some crime news in Chicago. Burglars broke into the office of former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich. Well, here's the amazing part.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Sarah Palin's book, 'Going Rogue,' number one on 'The New York Times' best sellers. ... Well, sadly, Sarah Palin will never know that because, as you know, she does not read 'The New York Times.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to 'The Globe,' Levi Johnston, you know the idiot? He's writing his memoirs. He's not writing it himself. He's using a ghost moron to help him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is interesting. A letter written by Thomas Jefferson in 1808 has been discovered at the University of Delaware. It's a personal letter thanking John McCain for his support in the election of 1804.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about...the couple that sneaked into the White House for the big state dinner? ... Now, they're going to be subpoenaed by the House Homeland Security Committee. And I thought well finally, they're being invited somewhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I mean honestly...you can't blame the Salahis for going where they're not invited. I mean, isn't that our foreign policy?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the CIA, Osama bin Laden has been slipping into Afghanistan. ... He likes to go into Afghanistan, do a little shopping, see a couple of shows, have dinner and then he goes home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday -- did you hear about this? You know who Sarah Palin is? ... She's at a book signing and somebody heaves a tomato at her. ... That's not good, but at least finally she and I have something in common.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, the global warming? They're having the big summit in Copenhagen, and it's being held this month over there in Denmark. ... Climate experts are telling us now that this has been the warmest decade in history. ... The good news is they're able to move the global warming conference outdoors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And tomorrow at the global warming conference, a Martian shows up in Copenhagen to issue the Earth a dire warning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But in terms of the temperature, going up and up and up, we are making some progress. Today over there at the conference in Copenhagen, they put a cap...on the number of hot girlfriends for Tiger Woods. That's going to cool things off a little bit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier tonight, ABC aired 'A Charlie Brown Christmas.' Finally aired it. It was, you know, that warm, entertaining Christmas special. It was supposed to be on last week, but it was postponed for the President's speech, which turned out not so warm or entertaining.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people were upset when the President postponed the Charlie Brown special. Obama himself had to deal with some tantrums when he got home. He had to give Joe Biden a time-out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday in Minnesota, a man was arrested because he threw two tomatoes at Sarah Palin during a book signing. ... Security immediately arrested the guy and gave him his own show on MSNBC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, the 'Today' show was live from Afghanistan this morning. It went head-to-head with Afghanistan's number one morning show, 'Good Morning and Death to America.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new study from Purina found that house cats spend about 22% of their days looking out windows, 12% of their days playing with other pets, 8% climbing on chairs and just 6% sleeping. The study also found that cats had the exact same schedule as Joe Biden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A man was arrested at the Mall of America yesterday for throwing tomatoes at Sarah Palin, or as Sarah Palin calls them, 'Italian apples.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last week...we were talking on the show about global warming, in particular how some stolen e-mails seemed to show that a leading climate change study center mistreated some of the data its science was based on. Now our point was not that global warming isn't happening. ... The point was that if you're getting into the global warming debate, you gotta have your numbers straight, otherwise you risk compromising your hard-won credibility. Fox News was making the same point just last Friday. ... 'Did scientists falsify research to support their own theories on global warming? This is a brand new Rasmussen poll. About 60% of you say somewhat likely, 35% say very likely. So you...got a lot of people right there thinking it is likely, although 26% say not very likely.' So in attacking scientists for falsifying data to support their theories on global warming, you've cited a poll that adds up to 120%. This is...what's known in the business as, uh, 'perfection.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am steamed about recent attacks on the Federal Reserve, known to most of us as 'the Fed,' and by bailed out banks as 'Dr. Blank Check Von Moneypants.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some conspiracy theorists out there have criticized the Fed as a secretive cabal that only benefits the well-connected, when in fact the Fed is merely an extra-constitutional star chamber that controls our monetary policy with no oversight. Big difference. ... Besides, there's no evil organization controlling the Fed. According to its website, 'The Federal Reserve System is not 'owned' by anyone.' See, just like most of the houses in your neighborhood.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And...the Fed needs that autonomy because they have an important job -- they set the prime interest rate for all loans. Raising rates encourages savings, while lowering them encourages spending on big-ticket items like houses and cars, unless you saved money by buying a house, in which case you now live in your car.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, at the Copenhagen Climate Summit -- where they talk about the environment, you know, saving the environment -- the delegates had 1,200 limousines and 140 private jets, or as they call that in Malibu, 'Earth Day.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, President Obama's approval rating has hit a new low -- 47% according to the latest Gallup poll. But White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said that a '6-year-old with a crayon could' come up with those same poll results. You know, I'll bet it's the same 6-year-old with a crayon that came up with the last budget they came out with.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of the budget, in his speech on the economy, President Obama said that we have to 'continue to spend our way out' of the recession. Now, I don't know much about economics, but aren't we like a trillion dollars in debt? Spending our way out of the recession? Isn't that like trying to drink your way out of alcoholism? I'm just saying.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And after a 13-year legal dispute over historical accounting mistakes by the Department of the Interior, the government has agreed to pay more than $3 billion in reparations to American Indians for the way they were treated...to which black people said, 'Hello?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know what President Obama is doing tomorrow? And this is kind of cool, especially if you're the President. He's going to accept his Nobel Peace Prize. ... And as you know, the Nobel Prize is a predictor of the Academy Awards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I looked this up. In the history of presidents in the United States, only two have won Nobel Prizes while they were in office. The first one, of course, Woodrow Wilson...because he is the man that they credit for ending World War I; second, Theodore Roosevelt, for, what? Yes. He invented the Teddy Bear.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Salahis ? now these are the people that crashed the state dinner at the White House for the prime minister of India. ... It looks like they're going to be subpoenaed now by the House Homeland Security Committee, and I'm thinking...why bother? They'd probably show up anyway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, did you hear about this, ladies and gentlemen? I thought this was exciting. Our top commander in Afghanistan, General McChrystal, says that it's time now to get Osama bin Laden. Why not? All right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the CIA, Osama bin Laden has been sneaking into Afghanistan from Pakistan and as a matter of fact, in Afghanistan, he lost $125 million in the casino.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have to say, not a great day for...President Obama. ... A new poll shows that President Obama has the lowest approval rating of any first-year president in the history of presidents. Things are so bad today the President said the surge in Afghanistan was all Tiger Woods' idea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rush Limbaugh says black people are depressed because President Obama isn't doing a very good job. ... That proving, once again, that no one has their finger on the pulse of the African-American community like Rush Limbaugh.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congress was hard at work today trying to come up with a fair playoff system for college football. Congress was working on this. Meanwhile, the NCAA spent the afternoon kicking around ideas for how to win the war in Afghanistan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They were like, the real issue wasn't health care, two wars and unemployment, it's who gets to play in the Little Caesars Pizza Bowl.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A California congressman named Joe Baca has announced he's no longer pursuing legislation that would have given Tiger [Woods] the Congressional Gold Medal. ... He released a statement saying, 'In light of the fact that Tiger has comported himself in a manner utterly lacking in character, dignity, and ethical integrity, I am withdrawing Tiger Woods from consideration for the Congressional Gold Medal and instead I'm recommending that he run for Congress.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President and First Lady are getting criticism from the right today. I know, who could have seen this coming? But they're getting criticism because they sent out the White House holiday card, and it says, 'Season's Greetings' on it, makes no mention of Christmas, and doesn't have a passage from the Bible in it like the ones the Bushes used to send out. But...actually, it does keep one beloved George Bush holiday card tradition alive, and that is the funny sound effect when you open the card. It wouldn't be Christmas without that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Huge event yesterday: 'Open for Questions.' A new experiment in open government debuted on the whitehouse.gov website. ... This attempt at...transparency brings up a good point, which is the subject of our new segment, 'Theory v Practice.' For instance, theory is transparency so in practice the Transportation Security Administration, the agency tasked with filling the holes in our transportation security systems...posted a 93-page manual detailing its airport security procedures on a government website for contractors. How'd that transparency work out? 'Breaking news -- a massive airport security breach -- the TSA posts its screening secrets online for everyone, including terrorists, to see.' 'It's a playbook.' 'It's practically a blueprint for terrorists.' .... 'How-to manual for terrorists.' It's 'Chicken Soup for the Soul,' of terrorists. It's 'The Da Vinci Code,' except not difficult to figure out, or about the Holy Grail, but in fact, terror.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now you may be wondering, why didn't the TSA just redact sensitive portions of the document? ... They did redact it, just not on the paper. They electronically redacted things. I'll...let the TV explain. 'But with a few keystrokes, bloggers were able to quickly remove the black.' Cheney's gone less than a year and you forget how to redact?!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Someone has to answer for this! What does the head of the TSA say in his defense? ... I'm being told the TSA has been without a permanent administrator for 11 months. There's no one in charge there. Merry Christmas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner confirmed today we are expected to lose $30 billion from our investment in the auto industry...to which Bernie Madoff goes, 'Hey, I could have done better than that.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, a lot of people don't understand why President Obama won&quot; the Nobel &quot;Peace Prize. Well, you know something? Look around you. Our factories, peaceful. I went to the mall this week, peaceful. They had an open house near my house, not one person came in. It's a peaceful economy here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to 'Time' magazine, even though college degrees costs more today, they're worth less in the job market, which is hard to believe, isn't it? There's a job market?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It sure is cold. ... So cold that Osama bin Laden was...seen hiding in the border region between Palm Beach and Fort Lauderdale.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big day for President Obama. He accepted his Nobel Prize today and then got right back to the business of running two wars.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not such a great day for the healthcare reform. The so-called public option died on the Senate floor today. It could have survived, but apparently it had a pre-existing condition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a great day for...President Barack Obama. He accepted a Noble Peace Prize in Norway. I don't want to say this Obama love is out of control, but his acceptance speech for the Nobel Prize just won a Pulitzer Prize, and his overall performance has just won an Oscar.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was a lot of controversy for President Obama in Norway, because apparently, he snubbed the Norwegian royal family. ... He snubbed them by canceling lunch with them. ... And I'm like, well don't be silly, Norwegian royal family. Even if the President doesn't invite you, just show up and crash the party. That's how we do it in America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The peace prize was handed out in Oslo, Norway, but Oslo's been in news this week because of that big swirly thing in the sky over Oslo. .... Wait! Wait! Strange star-like object over Oslo, right before Obama arrives, a gift of a gold medal given by a group of wise men. Nah. No. .... Even MSNBC are going, 'Nah, you took it too far.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, some people say that the light was a UFO coming to welcome Obama, which is of course ridiculous. Because if it was really a UFO, they would take Joe Biden back to his home planet. 'Come on, Joe, you've bothered these people long enough. Let's go and embarrass the people of Pluto.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new poll that just came out, 44% of Americans...wish President Bush were back in office. However...it's only 20% if you exclude comedy writers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senate Democrats proposed a $1.1 trillion spending bill that will provide funding for government agencies, foreign aid, and local construction projects. ... And also, since it's so close to Christmas, a pony!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big day for President Obama. During his Nobel Peace acceptance speech in Norway, Obama stated, 'Let us reach for the world that ought to be -- that spark of the divine that still stirs within each of our souls.' Obama got those words from his new speechwriter, Ken Hallmark.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The chairman of the Nobel Committee remarked that Obama's leadership is a 'call to action,' not to be confused with Bill Clinton's leadership, which was a call to get action.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The elementary school in Indonesia where President Obama went as a child, they just unveiled a statue of him as a 10-year-old. It's very realistic. In fact, today Biden spent, like, 20 minutes talking to it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The sculptor said that he worked on it for, like, two months, but after he finished the ears, the rest took, like, five minutes.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you all know, yesterday...President Barack Obama accepted the Nobel Peace Prize from the Norwegians. This comes almost two weeks after Tiger Woods was crowned by a Swede.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During his speech, President Obama spoke about the difficulty of accepting a peace prize while we're fighting two different wars. And President Bush got really upset. He said, 'Hey, I'm the one who started both those wars, I should have won the prize!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And next week, the Obama Administration will host their first Hanukkah party at the White House. And according to 'The New York Times,' a lot of people are upset, because it's a little smaller this year, and they weren't invited. ... Hey, it's the White House. You just sneak in, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And those mysterious lights over Norway people thought were UFOs, did you hear about this? A lot of people really scared. They thought it was a UFO. Well, today, Russia admitted it was just an out of control Russian missile. Oh, that's all? ... I feel so much safer now knowing it was just an out of control missile!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And during a speech on the economy, President Obama said this week we have to 'continue to spend our way out' of the recession, to which Nicholas Cage said, 'That's what I've been trying to do!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a South Carolina panel has voted not to impeach Republican Governor Mark Sanford. A fellow Republican, one of the panel chairmen, a guy named Tim Harrison, said, 'We can not impeach for arrogance or hypocrisy.' Well, of course not. There'd be no politicians left if you did that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the big...environmental summit has gone on in Copenhagen, the big UN Summit on climate change. And thank God! Thank God this has taken place because I want to tell you something, when the UN tackles a problem, it's gone! Adios! It's gone!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of heads of state at the Copenhagen summit, and a lot of scientists. And scientists are guy that don't get out a lot. ... So when they're around other scientists, it's just kind of a party, you know what I'm saying? ... And so the hottest pickup line now at the big Copenhagen climate summit is, 'Is it getting hotter, or is it you?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You like the big holiday movies? ... I guess the number one film in the country is called 'The Blind Side.' ... Is it about hunting with Dick Cheney? Is that right?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see President Obama's Christmas card? Neither did I, he never sent me one. But some people are angry that it doesn't contain the word 'Christmas.' But I think the message is there. The card shows three wise men asking for bailout money. It's right there. You can see it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday in Norway, President Obama gave a speech accepting his Nobel Peace Prize and Will Smith was in the crowd. ... Amazing. Yeah, the place was packed with Norwegians and yet somehow Obama was able to spot Will Smith.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Man it was freezing in New York today. Wasn't it cold? So cold, even Al Gore was like, 'All right, just give a little bit of global warming.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new poll found that 44% of Americans would rather have George W. Bush back as the President. The scary part is that one of those people was President Obama. He's like, 'Please, be my guest. It's all yours, buddy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This story is crazy here. The mother of a 56-year-old man in Ohio said that her son, who was arrested for making a pipe bomb, shouldn't be in prison because building pipe bombs is his hobby. Oh, moms! Even if you're a potential terrorist, they can't fight the urge to brag about you. 'Have you seen him with his pipe bombs? He's really getting good. I can't make them.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On MSNBC's 'Hardball' this week, Rep. Alan Grayson said instead of criticizing President Obama, Dick Cheney should 'STFU.' ... Right after that, Cheney threatened to shoot him in the F-A-C-E.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today at the White House, President Obama met with a group of the nation's top Wall Street bankers. And you know, these Wall Street bankers, they just don't get it, you know? Like, they walked into the White House and said to Obama, 'You live in this dump? What is this, the guest house? Please!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you hear about those five American Muslims who went to Pakistan and tried to join up and become terrorists with al Qaeda? ... Well, they got rejected. Al Qaeda rejected them -- this is true -- because they lacked the proper credentials and references. Isn't that unbelievable? Do you realize it's harder to get into al Qaeda than it is to get into the White House? That is wrong. Ridiculous!&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, in fact -- if you saw it on '60 Minutes' last night -- President Obama said never again will an unexpected guest sneak into the White House, so more bad news for Joe Biden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, did you hear about this? According to TMZ, you know, Congress was supposed to award Tiger Woods the Congressional Gold Medal, our highest civilian honor, then had to withdraw it, because of the scandal, which seems odd to me. I mean, what's it up to now? Fifteen mistresses? That sounds like something Congress would give you a medal for, doesn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about this guy, Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi? He is in Milan over the weekend. He's signing autographs and somebody throws a statuette at the guy and literally breaks his face wide open. Threw a statue at the guy. And I think this hasn't happened since, well, since I hosted the Academy Awards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hit him in the face with a statuette and then he backed over a fire hydrant. Yup. And then Gillette dropped him as a sponsor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what is great about this country? ... This time of year especially, you get people like Oprah, who is powerful and an icon and an American treasure and transcends television. She's a humanitarian. And last night, she had a big Christmas special that she videotaped at the White House. ... And it was just tremendous. But now, she interviewed the President and already, trouble. Trouble already. I mean, the Republicans are now complaining that President Obama bowed too low to Oprah. It's just awful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During an interview last night, Oprah Winfrey asked President Obama what grade he would give himself for his first year in office and he said a 'B-plus.' ... Then, Oprah shook her head and said, 'I didn't pay for a B-plus.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, last night I watched Oprah's White House Christmas special. President Obama told Oprah he deserves a 'solid B-plus' for his first year in office. That's a big improvement from our last president, who for the last eight years received a 'WTF.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Obamas also said on that Christmas Eve they will leave milk and cookies in the yellow room for Santa. And today, Glenn Beck accused them of trying to bribe a foreign dignitary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, Santa's got a good way of sneaking into the White House. He's just going to go with the two party crashers. 'Ho, ho, ho! I'm on the list.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This should be interesting. President Obama announced that he will hold a meeting at a Home Depot in Washington, DC, tomorrow to discuss energy saving techniques, although everyone expects the meeting to get a little late start after the Home Depot employee sends him to the wrong aisle. 'President meeting? That's in aisle five, I think. It might be aisle six. You know, it's not my department. I don't know.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is crazy. Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was hit...in the face at a rally in Rome yesterday. ... Berlusconi said he wasn't hit too hard, or too soft. ... He described the attack as 'al dente.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight we begin in Copenhagen. All the world's leaders converge on the Danish capital and they've got only 14 days to save the Earth, and visit Legoland.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But global warming critics are not without their hyperbole. 'Could it be that manmade global warming is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people? I believe it is.' ... Could it be?! ... See, on the one side, the fact that the world is warming, is well accepted. 'Adopted by most of the world's leading scientists, along with NASA, the UN, the American Medical Association, and the National Academies of Science of 32 countries, including the United States.' ... That's certainly stronger than the four out of five dentists recommend sugarless gum benchmark.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So clearly the leaders of the world are siding with the scientific community...and that sends a strong message that global warming is real and that the world is serious about doing something about it. 'Twelve hundred limousines have been ordered to ferry some of these VIPs to the summit. That's more than the country owns, so limos from hundreds of miles away in Germany are having to be driven in to Denmark so that they can take all of these limos, one person at a time, to the summit.' ... They're importing limos to a climate summit! And you know who the real victim here is? All those European high school students going to the prom this week. They've got to end up throwing up out of the sunroof of Smart Cars.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, America got to spend an hour with its first lady, Oprah Winfrey, as she sat down with the Obamas for their first Christmas in the White House. And you know the drill: Cute dog, cranberries, a little soft focus; shiny things. But then, what had been a puff piece turned into a blistering expos? of wasteful government. 'This gingerbread house took us six weeks to build. It weighs approximately 390 pounds; 140 pounds of that is the ginger bread...and then another 250 pounds of white chocolate.' ... Unfortunately, right after the piece was filmed, the house was foreclosed on.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, a year ago we all loved Barack Obama, but remember, back then, we all loved Crocs, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But, the Europeans, they still love him. ... But last Friday, Obama enraged Norwegians by accepting his peace prize, then immediately flying back to Washington, skipping all of the traditional post-speech events, such as the annual Norwegian Return to Obscurity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now one of the events he missed was the 'Save the Children' concert, which I assume he skipped because he hates children.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But organizers found an exciting workaround. 'Even though President Obama himself did not attend that concert or many of the other...Nobel events, a replacement was found. A cardboard cutout version of the American leader was seen onstage during a charity benefit concert Thursday.' Of course, this isn't new, folks. The winner of the Nobel Prize in 2007 was also replaced with a cardboard cutout, but since it was Al Gore, nobody noticed.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The other night they had that Christmas in Washington holiday special. And you know, people in Washington, right away, the bickering started. ... Lou Dobbs accused Santa of using illegal immigrant labor. Rush Limbaugh said the gifts were part of some kind of socialist give away program. The AFLCIO claims that Santa underpays his elves. And of course, since it's Washington, you're not going to find three wise men and a virgin. So the whole thing was pretty much a disaster.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Huge protest and hundreds of arrests at the UN Climate Change Conference in Denmark. At one point, it got so bad, the police played an Al Gore speech over the loud speaker just to sedate the crowd.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Iranian President Mahmoud Imanutjob -- is that how you say his name? He's going to address the climate summit this week in Copenhagen. And you know something, it's the same thing with this guy all the time. Like, Ahmadinejad said he believes global warming is caused by man, specifically the Jews.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, the government of Iran is now combating thousands of student protestors by slowing down their Internet access to a crawl. You know how they did it? Switched the whole country to AOL.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some sad news. Jenny Sanford, South Carolina's first lady, has filed for divorce. Apparently she's still angry about the second lady.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, one White House official said that the recession was over. ... And then, another White House official said, no, it's definitely not over. ... You wonder how those party crashers got in, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the White House announced that Guantanamo Bay's detainees will be sent to a prison in Illinois.... There's like 500 terrorists and suspected terrorists and alleged terrorists down there in Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. And they'll be moved now to a prison in Illinois. And I was thinking, well, this really should make up for Chicago not getting the Olympics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know the former governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin? She is now saying that global warming is a conspiracy. ... Doesn't believe it is true, even though she can see the polar ice cap melting from her house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Maybe she really doesn't read all the newspapers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Computer technicians in Washington say they have found 22 million missing emails from President George W. Bush's Administration. ... And you can tell the emails are from the Bush Administration because they all begin, 'Dear Santa.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During his speech at a Home Depot in Washington, DC, today, President Obama said he thinks energy efficiency and retrofitting are 'sexy.' He had to cut the speech short, however, after Al Gore showed up and tried to give him a lap dance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, President Obama was at a Home Depot. He said was looking for the perfect shovel to whack Joe Lieberman in the head with.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, Barack Obama hosted the first of two White House holiday parties for the press. It was a good time until Helen Thomas started hogging the karaoke machine. It was terrible. The only song she knew was 'Single Ladies.' It was really awkward.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are a lot of holiday parties coming up at the White House. Obama is getting ready to host the Administration's first Hanukkah party tomorrow. ... Kind of an embarrassing moment, though. Today, after they lit the menorah, Biden blew it out and made a wish.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Santa Claus, as you know, has a plan to fly around the world to deliver toys to all the good little boys and girls. Unfortunately, it's being blocked right now by Joe Lieberman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oprah visited the Obamas at the White House on Sunday night for her 'Christmas at the White House' special. She's actually thinking of buying the White House, and so she was scouting it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Monday the President of these United States summoned the heads of the biggest financial institutions to a no-holds-barred breakfast meeting at the White House in the Roosevelt Room, where the President would finally force the banks to make good on the promises that we never made them make.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And when the most powerful man in the world says, 'jump,' what do the CEOs of the three biggest financial institutions say? 'Three of the top bankers invited to the White House apparently won't be able to attend in person because their flights were delayed due to bad weather.' Bad weather? Ah, yesterday was sunny. Yesterday was a nice day. Unless you were flying down to Washington Icarus style, on wings of wax, and you were concerned there might be a little meltage, I'm not biting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, the Dems officially dropped from the Senate healthcare bill both the public option and an alternate plan for 55 to 65 year olds to buy into Medicare. At this point, the only reform left in the bill is government-mandated post-appointment lollipops.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But don't eat too many. You're not covered for type 2 diabetes.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Golden Globe nominations came out yesterday. President Obama picked up a nomination for best Democrat acting like a Republican. So, congratulations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, earlier this week at the White House, President Obama met with a group of the nation's top Wall Street bankers face-to-face. ... The meeting went well, although the bankers did charge President Obama 25 bucks for not using the ATM machine out front. See, it costs more if you see them in person.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Citigroup announced it is paying taxpayers back the $20 billion in bailout money it took. Wells Fargo announced it's paying back $25 billion it borrowed. And Bank of America says they've paid back the $45 billion in taxpayer money they borrowed. So the good news is taxpayers got their money back from Wall Street. The bad news? Congress has it. ... You'll never see it again, okay? It is gone. It is gone forever.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is pretty amazing. Computer technicians have found 22 million missing White House emails from the Bush Administration. In a related story, the White House gardeners were digging in the backyard yesterday, they found three former Dick Cheney hunting buddies buried right there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They found 22 million missing White House emails. You hear President Bush's excuse? He said he never bothered to ever send any of them because he couldn't find a stamp.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to our NBC affiliate in Wilmington, North Carolina, former Democratic presidential candidate John 'I am not the father' Edwards has reportedly bought a home for his former mistress. ... See, that's why John Edwards thinks there are two Americas. He's got two different women living in two different houses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, he bought a house for the woman he was having an affair with. Imagine if Tiger Woods started doing that. ... You could jump-start the housing market like that, and put millions of people back to work.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Signs There's Something Wrong With The Secret Service:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. 'Code 13' ? do not admit ? confused with 'code 31' ? invite for brunch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Keeps revealing President's itinerary on their Twitter page.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. When away from guard post, agents leave key to White House under doormat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Earpieces are often tuned to local Morning Zoo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. President Obama's on his own tomorrow night while security screens 'Avatar.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Recently let Bush back into the White House because he wanted to do some more 'presidentin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Accidentally spent three weeks protecting Men's Wearhouse President George Zimmer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. When short of personnel, agents replaced by Wal-Mart greeters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Currently have 15 agents protecting Nixon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Obama's code name: 'The Situation.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about what happened a couple of months ago at the White House? There were some tourists taking the tour of the White House. ... And the next thing you know, they're invited to have breakfast with the President. ... So they went in and had breakfast with the President. And it turns out it was a huge mistake. They crashed breakfast with the President. And everybody was very upset, because they were supposed to crash a Cabinet meeting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the Secret Service said that the couple had been properly screened. Well, that's great. Who's screening the Secret Service? That's what I want to know!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But you know in the old days, when President Bush was down there in the White House, we didn't...have security breaches. ... And I'll tell you why. We had 'Shotgun' Dick Cheney running things.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Good news, ladies and gentlemen. Retail sales this year are up. ... That is fantastic news for the economy of China.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was walking around today on my lunch hour, and I noticed that there are fewer...sidewalk Santas this year. ... And then I remembered that President Obama sent the Salvation Army to Afghanistan. So that's what happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight, ladies and gentlemen, earlier tonight, down in Washington, the annual White House Hanukkah party. ... I think it probably went better than it did last year. Do you remember last year, how embarrassing it was, George Bush hosting the annual White House Hanukkah party? And he greets everybody as they come in and he says, 'Happy harmonica.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the time of the year 'Time' magazine announces their person of the year. You know who it is this year? Chairman of the Fed, Ben Bernanke. ... All right, girls, please, settle down, okay! He's not here, all right?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wow, yeah. That was a big surprise. They selected Ben Bernanke as the -- all right! Please! Once more and you're out of here, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama -- this is an odd bit of news -- he is going to appear on a WWE wrestling special. ... Clearly he wants another one of them peace prizes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Obama's...taking this appearance seriously. He's been practicing by repeatedly hitting Joe Biden over the head with a folding chair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This, by the way, is the first time a president has participated in a wrestling event, if you don't count Bill Clinton's mud wrestling fiasco towards the end of his...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama says that Congress is very close to getting a new healthcare plan, but due to compromises, it 'won't include everything that everybody wants.' ... For instance, it covers everything except trips to the doctor or the hospital.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama has written a personal letter to North Korean dictator Kim Jong- Il, in an effort to improve relations. ... It may not work because the letter starts, 'Dear Mr. Girly Glasses.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You guys, listen to this. It turns out the Secret Service accidentally let another random couple into a private reception with Obama, which means at this point the White House is slightly less exclusive than the Burger King Kids Club.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this is good. Democratic leaders are hoping to pass healthcare reform before Christmas. And really, what better Christmas present could Obama give the country than the gift of not having to talk about healthcare anymore?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This morning, 'Time' magazine named Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke its 2009 Person of the Year. I'm not sure he deserves it. I think 'Time' just knows what everybody in the magazine business knows -- you put Bernanke on the cover and you're going to sell some copies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Governor Schwarzenegger is in a bit of a feud with former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin right now. They're fighting about global warming. Palin says it isn't proven. Schwarzenegger said she's 'living in the Stone Age.' And Palin really should know not to mess with Arnold Schwarzenegger. ... This guy has been systematically terminating women named Sarah for many years now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's almost the end of the year people, but before Congress went home for the holidays, there was time for one last big Tea Party protest. 'Kill the bill! Kill the bill!' Yeah, this time it was about healthcare reform. ... What is it that they...want? 'What we want is better healthcare, lower cost, not more government and more taxes.' Oh! There you go -- simple, concise and impossible! 'What we want is more sunshine but without the heat and brightness. We're going to do it by not opening the blinds, but we're going to close the sky!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course...it's more of a fringe group of very extreme...activists. No one is taking it seriously. Well, except for sitting senators, former House majority leaders, congresspeople, and Fox News stars, who helped put the day in perspective. 'I am proud to stand with you today and I am saying...with great respect, closing with this: First they came for the rich, and I did not speak out because I was not rich.' What?! ... You said 'with great respect.' ... You're paraphrasing the famous homily about the Holocaust to complain about the government possibly raising the marginal tax rate back to where it was in the Clinton years. You don't have to say 'with great respect.' It's implied. I mean, it's so obviously equal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, the Patriot Act is America's finest piece of post 9/11, hastily passed, fear-based legislation. Unfortunately, folks, Congress forgot to make it permanent. Portions of the act are set to expire at midnight on December 31st, meaning this year we could all be watching 'Khalid Sheikh Mohammed's New Year's Rockin' Jihad.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to 'Lopez Tonight.' This is the show people watch when...they're not sneaking into the White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to MSNBC, President Obama's approval rating has now dipped below 50%. To tell you how bad it is, people are now finding ways to sneak out of the White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember the phrase, 'hope and change'? They amended it today. Now it's 'don't give up hope, nothing is going to change.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and listen to this. It happened...yet again last month. A Georgia couple showed up a day early for a tour at the White House -- you know, just regular folks. Showed up to tour the White House, somehow wound up in an invitation only breakfast with President Obama and the First Lady. ... Isn't that amazing? The only two people that couldn't get in the White House this year were John McCain and Sarah Palin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Obama Administration announced today that the Shinnecock Indians...on Long Island&quot; will &quot;be federally recognized, which means they can now build a casino in New York City. ... The White House recognized them...as an official tribe after meeting with the four tribal leaders, Fat Tony, Louie the Barber, Crazy Sal, and Momo Ricardo. ... The Gambino tribe, indigenous people to the area.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And listen to this. After one single senator, just one senator -- Joe Lieberman of Connecticut -- was able to block passage of the Medicare buy-in provision of that healthcare bill, some people are calling for the Senate to begin experimenting with a whole new way of doing business. Yeah, it's called majority rules. They're thinking of trying it to see how it works.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, on the news today, people are complaining that we can't find Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan. Bin Laden in Afghanistan? We can't even find Tiger Woods in Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senior New York Senator Chuck Schumer was on an airplane and they were flying someplace. And they landed. He called one of the flight attendants a bitch. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's good news, I think. The Democrats down in Washington believe they have 60 votes to pass a healthcare bill. ... That's 58 Democrats and the Salahis. They're going to go in there and vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But they don't think that the healthcare bill will get passed before Christmas, unless they switch to the Mayan calendar.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a 'New York Times'/CBS News poll, 26% of unemployed adults blame George W. Bush for the high unemployment rate. The other 74% blame the fact that they majored in English literature.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know what to make out of this. NASA is in the process of trying to convert human waste into fuel. Man, talk about pressure to go on command, right? 'Come on, Barry, just pee. We got to get back to Earth, man.' 'I can't do it. Everyone is staring at me, man. Stop looking at me.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's hard to believe there's only two weeks left in 2009. President Obama is already said to be hard at work on his New Year's resolutions. His plan for 2010 is to do all the things he said he was going to do this year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, this is interesting. After somebody threw a tomato at Sarah Palin during a book signing at the Mall of America,&quot; she went to another signing at a Costco in Utah, where &quot;they took all the tomatoes off the shelves. ... So instead she got hit by a three pound bag of frozen spinach ravioli.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now here's something. According to new poll numbers ? remember when Barack Obama was first elected president over a year ago, and ? the first 100 days, the honeymoon period, his poll numbers were amazingly high. We were accustomed to the George Bush single-digit poll numbers you know ? 2% believe you're doing a good job. Okay, thanks, ma!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This happens to every president, Barack Obama's approval rating is down to 44%. 44%. Hell, I'd kill for numbers like that. Are you kidding me? 44%?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, the poll numbers are so low now the Salahis don't even want to be seen with him.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;[Science fiction film] 'Avatar' takes place in the year 2154, and still no health care bill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You guys read that Washington, D.C. Is going to get a ton of snow this weekend. If it snows hard enough in D.C., the city shuts down and Congress can't get anything done. You know, sort of like when it's not snowing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's freezing in D.C. In fact, today, Sasha and Malia had to help Biden get his tongue unstuck from the flag pole.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You guys, on Fox News yesterday, White House senior adviser David Axelrod said that president Obama hasn't given up on achieving something valuable in Copenhagen. Wow. In one year gone from 'yes, we can' to 'we haven't totally given up.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, everyone is still talking about health care. Bill Clinton said that while the health care bill is still not perfect, the Senate should still go ahead and get it done. Get it passed. And Clinton was like, '&quot;Put it this way. When it's last call on a Saturday night, sometimes you got to settle for a 4 instead of a 7.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama had some tough words for Congressmen who aren't backing his health care bill. He told Representative Peter DeFazio, 'Don't think we're not keeping score, brother.' Then he took a moment to introduce his new speech writer, Hulk Hogan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, an embarrassing moment for Senator John Edwards today. I guess he was at a church, he saw the nativity scene. Saw the baby Jesus, out of force of habit, wrote Mary a check.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, it was on this date in 1843 that Charles Dickens published his classic novel 'A Christmas Carol.' ... There's now an updated 2009 version. In this one, Scrooge goes broke, but he gets a $25 billion bailout. Tiny Tim becomes a pawn in the health care debate, and Bob Cratchit can't get any more coal to stay warm, because it violates a U.N. agreement in Copenhagen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Washington, it looks like the Senate is almost done with the health care bill, otherwise known as the Joe Lieberman Insurance Company Preservation Act. That's what it's called now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Obama -- actually, President Obama said the federal government will go bankrupt unless we pass the health care bill, which is great news. I thought we were already bankrupt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Glenn beck is on the show tonight. You know, I thought... I can't believe he took time out from the U.N. Climate conference to be here. I'm stunned.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has gotten into a war of words with Sarah Palin over global warming. You know, wouldn't it be great if these two actually had a debate? I mean, how much fun would that be to listen to? 'You betcha!' 'Fantastic!' 'You betcha!' 'Fantastic!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton went to Copenhagen and announced America's support of a $100 billion climate protection fund. She said she's personally seen evidence of global warming. In fact, even her relationship with Bill is now starting to thaw.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of the holidays, President Obama's daughter Sasha says she already bought her dad's gift, but she won't say what it is. She does say it's something he likes. That was her quote, yeah. Which begs the question, how did an 8-year-old get her hands on a carton of Marlboro Lights?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about this? This was crazy. Yesterday, President Obama prank called a Washington radio station. He prank called the radio station, calling himself Barry from D.C. That's a true story, yeah. Then just to mess him, Obama called Glenn Beck's radio show as b. Hussein from Kenya.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, I love this -- did you hear about this? Did you hear about this? Yesterday, President Obama said his wife, Michelle, decided they should not buy each other Christmas gifts this year. ... Mr. President, if you're listening, it's a trap! Listen! She doesn't mean it. Go shopping. Let me tell you something Mr. President, if you Don't buy her a gift, you better hope health care passes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The wife of Al Qaeda's second in command is now calling on women to become suicide bombers. To qualify, they must be able to push a car loaded with explosives. 'cause as you know, women aren't allowed to drive over there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Beginning this spring, the federal government will impose stiff penalties on airlines to keep passengers on planes longer than three hours. If they make passengers sit on the runway for more than three hours, it would be unsafe. Well, of course it's unsafe. I mean, how drunk would the pilots be by then?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama surprised Virginia Governor Tim Kaine yesterday by calling into a radio show he was on. But Obama had trouble hearing him because Biden was in the background going, 'ask him to play pokerface.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been a long time coming, but tomorrow morning at 8:00 A.M. is the Senate's big health care vote, which means starting at 5:00 A.M., me and my buddies will be tailgating in the Senate parking lot.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Good to see everybody. You know, it is good to be back. We were off for Christmas and apparently so was the Department of Homeland Security.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you heard about that kid that tried to blow up the plane on Christmas Day with a bomb he had hidden in his underwear. Before he could get the bomb lit, some hero passengers grabbed him. They dragged him into first class. See, I had no idea that's how you got upgraded on Delta. I thought it was a point system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He tried to detonate the bomb in his underwear. Fortunately, it didn't go off and his underpants just caught fire. ... Al Qaeda calls that...'a wardrobe malfunction.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After it was announced that Senate Foreign Relations Chairman John Kerry may go to Iran, the mullahs denied him an entry visa. ... See, that's how international travel works. If your name is Senator John Kerry and you're a former candidate for President of the United States, your travel is limited. If your name is Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, you stow a bomb in your underpants, you pay cash for a one-way ticket after your father called the embassy and said, 'My kid is an idiot,' ooh, you can go anywhere you want.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rush Limbaugh is okay after being released from a Hawaiian hospital after a heart scare. ... Fox News sent flowers, MSNBC sent cheese fries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, no one knows...what caused Rush Limbaugh's chest pains. But if you're Rush Limbaugh, it could've been a number of things. I mean, the economy's getting better, the healthcare bill is going to pass; the Republicans are having trouble raising money. It could be any one of those things.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And scientists now say that...within 40 years robots will be doing most of the jobs we don't want to do, especially illegal robots from Mexico.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The global warming conference has been cancelled. Right. We don't need it. You see, because it's so damn cold.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And how about this...23-year-old kid from Nigeria? Goes to Yemen and he's flying to Detroit and he wants to blow the plane up. He sets his underpants on fire. And thank God the passengers on the plane subdue the guy. They secure him, they tie him up and they move him to first class. ... Are we sending the right message there, really?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And people everywhere are pointing fingers about security. They're saying, 'Well, you know, you should have done this and you should have done that and you should have done this.' And I'm telling you, this guy paid cash for his ticket for a flight to Detroit. Now you tell me -- what is the bigger red flag in this economy? The fact that somebody had cash, or they wanted to go to Detroit?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's good news. Isn't it about time we had a little good news? Our good friend Regis Philbin had hip replacement surgery. He's back on the job. ... That means only ten million unemployed people to go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, how about this? Rush Limbaugh, there's a big boy. He...was also in the hospital. He said he had chest pains and I thought, oh he is just trying to get some of those painkillers. That's what he is doing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But here's how it works. Here's the official line of succession in control of the Republican Party. If Rush Limbaugh is disabled in any way, then control of the party is passed to Glenn Beck. That's the line of succession.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone's back from vacation today. In Washington, President Obama returned to the Oval Office after spending the holidays in Hawaii. And Joe Biden returned after spending the holidays on his home planet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you go and see the 'Avatar' movie? ... The 3-D blockbuster has now made one billion dollars. Today, the auto industry issued a statement. They'd like to remind people that all their cars are in 3-D.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama took his daughters to see the 3- D version of 'Avatar.' ... There was an awkward moment when one of Obama's daughters leaned over to him and whispered, 'Now, that's how you spend half a billion dollars.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Has everybody here seen 'Avatar'? Great movie, wasn't it? ... Even President Obama took his family to see it at a private screening in Hawaii. After the movie, Obama was like, 'So that's what it's like when something lives up to its hype.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You guys hear this? Rush Limbaugh was released from a hospital in Hawaii two days after suffering from chest pains. He's fine. Doctors say they don't know what caused it but it may have something to do with being an overweight man whose job is being enraged.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I do hope you guys had a restful holiday. How could you not, with news like this? 'An al Qaeda plot to blow up a US airliner on Christmas Day.' Have yourself a merry little -- ahhh!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Once again, the industrious souls of elf Qaeda trying to spread a little Christmas fear throughout the land but this terror plot didn't come from their workshop at the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. 'The bomb was built and the plot organized by al Qaeda leaders in the country of Yemen.' Yes! We got us a new front in the war on terror!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So what did the al Qaeda masterminds of 'Terror 2.0' cook up? 'Federal investigators say the man accused of the attempted bombing...hid a powerful explosive powder in specially made underwear.' ... Now, whenever there's an incident like this, the question is always, could we have seen it coming? But in this case, a Nigerian guy from Yemen with Doomsday underpants. That seems to come out of nowhere. 'As early as August of 2009, the Central Intelligence Agency was picking up information on a person of interest dubbed 'The Nigerian.' 'The suspect already on a US terror watch list.' 'Put there after his father -- a Nigerian banker -- told the US five weeks ago that he was worried his son was becoming radicalized.' Okay, um, all right. I too have a tendency to ignore messages from Nigerian bankers who wish to help me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But when they show up in person and aren't asking for a money order but instead turning in their own son, maybe that conversation doesn't get filed under spam. 'His visa had been yanked by the British. He...paid cash for his ticket. It was a one-way ticket.' 'He paid nearly $3,000 in cash for his plane ticket and checked no bags.' ... It's December! He's going from Nigeria to Amsterdam to Detroit, without a coat? With a one-way ticket. Oh, do you think he's going to Detroit to start a better life? What, do you think he's going there because he heard there's lots of jobs?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So the national security system failed. Luckily, the knee-jerk partisan blame system was in perfect working order. 'The President waits 72 hours before we hear from him. ... And it's over 72 hours from the time of the incident to the time that the President spoke today.' Unbelievable: 72 hours! The time it took President Obama to talk about this. Jack Bauer could have caught the terrorist three times in that period.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was different when old Karl Rove's boss was in charge and some other guy ? Richard Reid ? tried to blow up that plane. Bush got right out there and talked about it after only, six days, which is much less than 72.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, I don't know about you, but this Christmas, my flight home was rough, mostly because I walked. You see, like you, I was terrified by the attempted bombing of Delta flight 253 on Christmas Day. But what really filled my pants with figgy pudding was that the alleged bomber...had the explosives 'sewn into' his underwear.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the good news ? you know the...Nigerian underwear bomber? He is now in custody.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, a lot of people complaining that...traveling here in the United States is a pain; we shouldn't have to go through a pat-down search. You think you should? Yeah, I mean, hey, when you go to a football stadium, they pat you down, right, huh? I mean, shouldn't the country be as least as hard to get into as a Cleveland Browns game? Don't you think?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And former President Bush says he's been following the situation in Yemen very carefully. But, you know, we love President Bush, but I don't think he really understands the situation. Like today, President Bush said, 'When life gives you Yemens, you make Yemenade.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the government investigated yet another terrorist threat today. Luckily...it was just McDonald's announcing they're bringing back the McRib sandwich.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, the McRib is coming back. That's why Rush Limbaugh was rushed to the hospital. ... I knew there was something going on!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, the doctor who examined Rush Limbaugh says that he's fine, back to normal. That's good to know.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cold. Am I right? ... You know, Rush Limbaugh was...ill. And he had to go to the hospital. He had chest pains but he's completely recovered. He'll be back on his job on Wednesday, which is great because the country really can use some hot air now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember they had the big state dinner for the Prime Minister of India and a couple of people who weren't invited show up, the Salahis? ... And now it turns out there was a third person who was not invited that showed up at the state dinner. I mean, it's a little crazy. I mean, before that, the only person I knew who showed up at the White House without the proper credentials was George Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I think the thing that's still bothering people ? there's a flight, it originates overseas, they make a stop in Amsterdam and then they come to Detroit and there's a guy on the plane over Detroit and he's wearing exploding underpants and he tries to blow up the plane. Exploding underpants. That's...what it's come to, ladies and gentlemen. Exploding...underpants. Do you remember the old Road Runner cartoons? Isn't that something you could get from Acme? Couldn't you get the big crate and there'd be the exploding underpants?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new poll asked Americans who their ideal next-door neighbor would be. The number one answer was the Obama family...mainly because the Obamas are the kind of neighbors who would lend you a cup of sugar or a trillion dollars.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama has appointed a transgender woman to a position in the Department of Commerce. .. You know, in this era of partisan bickering, President Obama deserves a lot of credit for taking a chance on Ann Coulter, I think.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's now been reported that Britain...did pass information on to US authorities about the attempted underwear bomber, but the US disregarded it. ... In part, that's because the British intelligence referred to him as 'a bloke with boomzy-woomzy in his knickers.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama spent the day talking to officials about airline security. One of the things they are doing is adding dozens of names to the no-fly list. Uh, hello, have you tried flying out of Newark? We're all on the no-fly list.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you guys hear about this? The Secret Service just discovered that a third uninvited guest got into Obama's state dinner back in November, although Joe Biden insists he was actually invited.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was reading today that President Obama has started updating the Oval Office to reflect his personality, which basically just means he took down President Bush's autographed cast photo from the 'Dukes of Hazzard.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tomorrow at the White House, President Obama is going to recognize a group of teachers for their award-winning work in teaching math and science. Obama said he's looking forward to it, because he always likes meeting people from China.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of states are faced subzero temperatures this week. Everyone's taking precautions. In fact, airports are on the lookout for thermal underwear bombers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about the guy that blew up his underpants? People are mad about that. I think it's funny. I don't know. Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab. You would never guess he'd be mixed up in something like this. Not Abdulmutallab.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fortunately his bomb didn't work how he wanted. He was tackled by a Dutch filmmaker, which, that had to be embarrassing. Tackled by a Dutch filmmaker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And conservatives have been criticizing President Obama. I guess they figure with ears like that he should have overheard something.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, after the shoe bomber, they made us take off our shoes. Now, this underwear thing, could be a real problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wonder if mothers of terrorists tell their kids to wear clean underwear in case something great happens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's talk now we may have to go through these full body scanners, which would allow TSA screeners to see us, not exactly naked, but...close enough that every time Salma Hayek goes to the airport, there's going to be a line of guys in blue polyester blazers running to their posts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, as you know, it's been more than eight years since the attacks of 9/11 permanently scared our country. But in that time, I take solace in the fact that our leaders over these past eight years have almost now completed the process of figuring out what to name the as yet undesigned, unbuilt structure that will ultimately occupy the steel barren area at ground zero. But of course, these...things take time, which is why this little story out of Dubai caught my interest. 'Well, a big celebration in Dubai. The world's tallest building being inaugurated.' ... Must have taken them decades to build it. 'The Burj, by the way, began ? the building for it, the construction, began back in 2004.' Gyyyaaaaahhhh!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Senator Chris Dodd unveiled his plan to reduce corruption in the Senate. He's retiring.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After 30 years, embattled Senator Chris Dodd announced he would not seek re-election. He said he may go to work for the banking industry. Have you seen his voting record? I think he already works for the banking industry.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and Mitt Romney was on 'Fox and Friends.' He talked about his plan to run for president in 2012. It could be Mitt Romney versus Sarah Palin, which would be quite a matchup. I mean, one is a former governor obsessed with looks and hair. And the other, of course, is from Alaska.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The annual list of the most admired men in the world came out today. Bill Clinton and Tiger Woods are tied. ... I wonder what those two would have in common.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody make New Year's resolutions? ... I have to find something to do. ... I'm going to crash a White House state dinner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was reading a book about Osama bin Laden, and it was written by his son, and according to the son, in the book about his father, the kid claims Osama bin Laden was a cruel parent. Gosh, you think you know somebody.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the book is written by bin Laden's dumb son, Osama W. bin Laden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, President Obama honored more than 80 teachers for excellence in math and science. ... Then he begged them to leave China and come teach here in the United States.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congratulations to President Obama on becoming an uncle. His brother-in-law, Craig Robinson, and his wife just had a son in Oregon. Or so they claim. Lou Dobbs is demanding to see the birth certificate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The child's name is Austin Robinson. Next week, he'll go before the Senate and if they confirm him, he becomes the official nephew of President Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They have an interesting tradition in the Obama family. Every new baby born into the Obama family is baptized by Oprah in a 24 karat gold tub full of angel tears.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know that the Yemen thing complicates the war on terror, but on the plus side, getting attacked is really the only way we Americans learn about world geography.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The heaviest snowfall in over 60 years has been recorded in Beijing, China. In fact, there was so much snow on the streets; a lot of 6-year-old kids couldn't get to their factory jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, yeah, I'm way out of line there. ...You all wear the sneakers. You just don't care where they're made, but okay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, we're learning more and more about the country of Yemen. That's where that underwear bomber kid was trained. It turns out it has one of the world's highest birthrates. Every woman there has at least six children. Unbelievable, yeah. And listen, they manage to do that without even having an NBA team. Okay, so that's pretty...amazing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Connecticut Senator -- Democratic senator -- Chris Dodd announced he is retiring at the end of his term. Dodd's approval rating began to fall after he allegedly received sweetheart loans from Countrywide Mortgage. You might know the story. He got the loans while he was chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, although he claims he didn't realize he was getting special treatment. He said he didn't understand how the bank loan system worked, see, which would be a good argument if you weren't the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new book out claims that Franklin Delano Roosevelt secretly had skin cancer and that's what actually killed him in 1945. Now, this is a stunning claim because if it turns out to be true, it would make no difference whatsoever.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Scientists are now developing wearable wireless sensors to monitor overweight people as they go about their daily lives. See, that's when you we Americans are getting too fat, okay? ... When they're tracking us like whales, that's bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, speaking of that, researchers in Great Britain have developed a...dinner plate to fight obesity. It senses how much food is on the plate and how fast you're eating it. And if you eat too fast, the plate tells you to slow down and reminds you to eat less. They say there are no long-term studies because most people smash the plate after the second&quot; they &quot;eat off of it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cold here in New York City. And I'm always screaming about the global warming. Maybe I'm wrong.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many people flew to get here? I mean, come on, isn't flying more fun than it used to be? I mean, really. They make you take off your shoes, make you take off your underpants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I mean you think about the guy, the...Nigerian guy, he is going to blow up the thing. ... He was wearing a pair of Fruit of the Lunatic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Guy was not too bright. He said that the reason he became a suicide bomber was to work his way up in the al Qaeda organization.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you folks know anything about the Skull And Bones society. It's like a fraternal organization, at Yale University. Well, they're auctioning off a human skull. ... And I was thinking about this. I believe this is the first empty skull to come out of Yale, well, I think since George W. Bush, actually.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Legal experts are saying, if he's convicted, the underwear bomber could be sentenced to life in Federal prison. ... But even worse, for the rest of his life, he'll be known as the underwear bomber.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Next week, President Obama will visit the auto show in Detroit and look at cars from the Big Three automakers. ... Or, as the Big Three automakers put it, 'the new owner is coming for a visit.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is weird. Yesterday, a naked jogger was stopped near the White House. ... Secret Service grabbed the man and immediately allowed him to attend a state dinner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, some people are really upset because President Obama has decided to redecorate the Oval Office, and he got rid of former President Bush's bust of Winston Churchill. ... When he heard about it, Bush was furious and said, 'Winston Churchill? I thought that was Higgins from 'Magnum P.I.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, a man in Washington, DC, was apprehended by Secret Service yesterday for taking off his clothes and jogging naked near the White House. In...related news, I say that's probably the last time Biden ever takes Ambien.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;White House Budget Director Peter Orszag&quot; had &quot;a baby with...a beautiful shipping heiress, just weeks before he got engaged to this other beautiful lady, who is a news reporter.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, in an effort to calm people down after this latest security problem, the White House said it is working even harder to find Osama bin Laden. And here's the frustrating part. Turns out we almost had him. Did you hear about this? Earlier this year, he snuck into a White House state dinner. Nobody recognized him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here is something quite serious and frightening. On a Delta flight from Miami to Detroit, a man of Palestinian descent stood up on the plane and yelled, 'I want to kill all the Jews.' And there was silence on the plane. Even more silence when the flight attendant said, 'Who ordered the kosher meal?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, I love...this. The underwear bomber pleaded not guilty in court today. He had a bomb in his underpants, okay! 'What is your defense?' 'I didn't know there was a bomb in my underpants.' Oh, 'I was framed by the Fruit of the Loom guys.' What are you doing? How could you plead not -- there was a bomb in your underpants. So stupid!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to 'The New York Post,' White House Budget Director Peter Orszag announced his engagement to an ABC News reporter six weeks after his ex- girlfriend gave birth to his baby. And of course, people were shocked. 'The White House has a budget director?' 'Where's he been?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New Jersey Senate rejected a gay marriage bill. Now, why? Last time a gay man got married in New Jersey, he went on to become governor of the state, didn't he?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about the guy? He starts off in Nigeria, then to Amsterdam and to Detroit. And just as they are landing in Detroit he tries to get his underpants to explode. ... So they jump the guy and they save the whole plane load of people and finally the commotion woke up the pilot and he comes...running out. And he puts out the fire with his pitcher of margaritas. Thank God! Had a happy ending.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you remember the...governor from Illinois that was selling in the Senate seat? Remember Rod Blagojevich? ... Listen to this now. He will be appearing on 'Celebrity Apprentice.' ... I hate to see them water down the strict use of the word celebrity, don't you?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But already, there was a very ugly incident. You are not going to believe what happened. In the early rehearsals of 'Celebrity Apprentice', that thing on Trump's head attacked the thing on Blagojevich's head.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is going to an auto show that will feature all the hot new models from the Big Three automakers. ... No word yet on when he gets back from Japan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, yesterday, former President Clinton stopped by the White House for a meeting with President Obama. ... Then, out of habit, Clinton left by shimmying down the drain pipe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While speaking about the war on terror yesterday, President Obama said, 'There is of course, no fool-proof solution. We have to stay one step ahead of a nimble adversary.' Nimble adversary? Sounds like somebody saw 'Sherlock Holmes' over the holiday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama also said, 'We are at war against al Qaeda' and 'we will do whatever it takes to defeat them.' Then Obama was like, 'Literally, whatever it takes -- speeches, talks, speech talks, talks about speeches, speaking about the talk I just spoke about, personal appearances.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama met with former President Bill Clinton at the White House yesterday in a meeting closed to the press. It was pretty awkward. Hillary called. And at the exact same time, they both said, 'I'm not here!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You guys excited about the final season of 'Lost'? ... Well, fans are worried that the show's three-hour season premiere on February 2nd could be bumped if President Obama gives his State of the Union speech that night, which is ironic, because 'Lost' is also the name of the speech he plans on giving.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Mexican government is upset Starbucks is using a pre-Aztec logo without permission. In fairness, Mexico is using the United States without permission.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And on Friday, the White House announced that President Obama's State of the Union address scheduled for next month will not air on the same night as the premiere of 'Lost' on ABC. ... Well, they did that because they thought viewers might get confused. See, lost is also the State of the Union: Lost jobs; lost wage; lost houses; lost businesses. So, the two -- you can get them mixed up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House said they're working even harder now to try and find Osama bin Laden. In fact, they have now put his picture on the side of cartons of goat's milk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of John McCain's former top campaign aides says that when he talked to Sarah Palin after McCain picked her to be his running mate, she said it was 'God's plan.' ... So, apparently, God wanted Obama to win.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin has just signed with Fox News. So, now they're fair and unbalanced.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm tired of being cold. And I'm upset with that Al Gore, too. Always shooting his mouth off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cold down in Washington, DC. It was so cold today that Senator Harry Reid actually enjoyed being in hot water.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former New York City Mayor Rudolph Guiliani, you know what he said? That there were no terrorist attacks during the Bush Administration. Well...you know, that would be great if it was true.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And apparently, the Mayor misspoke. He forgot about the attack of 9/11. Yeah, forgot about that one. Forgot about the shoe bomber, there was another one. Forgot about Dick Cheney duck hunting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin, former governor of Alaska, is going to be part of the Fox News team. ... So, yeah. Finally, finally, her years of reading all those newspapers and magazines&quot; have &quot;really paid off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This should balance things out over at...Fox News.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a great day for Sarah Palin. She was hired as a commentator for Fox News. She signed a multi-year contract, which means she'll probably quit after a year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some critics are saying that Palin won't last on Fox because she's an over-emotional woman who...gets the facts wrong. But I disagree. It's working great for Glenn Beck, so she'll be fine. 'What?!' 'You heard me!' 'Hey, wait a minute!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is under fire for discussing whether or not President Obama has a 'negro dialect.' ... Reid is also in trouble for saying Joe Lieberman 'talks all Moses-y.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Listen to this. In his weekly radio and Internet address, President Obama said 'we are on the verge' of guaranteeing Americans health insurance 'whether they lose their job, change jobs, move or get sick,' which means Jay, Conan and I are going to be just fine. So don't worry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin just signed on to be a contributor to the Fox News Channel. She chose the job after carefully weighing her other option, just going away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of Sarah Palin, I was watching '60 Minutes' last night and a former McCain campaign aid said that when Palin found out she would become John McCain's running mate, she said, 'It's God's plan,' to which God responded, 'What? Really? Don't bring me into this.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new study found that 5% of baby boomers admit to getting high and popping pills. Come on now. I know he's a big guy but it's not fair to call Rush Limbaugh 5% of baby boomers. ... That's just rude.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So it's Monday. ... In the meetings, we recap the wacky stories of the weekend, kind of look at what we have to choose from, hopefully a politician saying some crazy things. 'Blagojevich says, 'I'm blacker than Barack Obama.&quot; Wow! Whoa! ... Oh, snap! Rod Blagojevich is so black, he should be called 'Tyler Perry Presents Rod Blagojevich.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's definitely a bold claim. What's he using to back it up? 'I shined shoes. I grew up in a five-room apartment. My father had a little laundromat in a black community not far from where we lived.' A five-room apartment and your dad owned a business that made money off the black community. I...think you're confusing black with middle class white.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At least there are no pre-disgraced Democrats making ridiculously tone deaf racial statements. 'News that Harry Reid praised Obama's electability as a -- quote ? 'light skinned' African-American ? quote ? 'with no negro dialect unless he wanted to have one', risks weakening the Senate majority leader.' I'm sure Harry Reid will use the world negro, especially if comes right before the words college fund on the hefty check that I'm sure he's writing at this very moment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, over the Christmas break,&quot; a man &quot;tried to blow up a plane bound for Detroit. The would-be terrorist was this Nigerian guy, or as Harry Reid would like to put it, 'a dark-skinned negro.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well off course, the big political story, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid got himself in hot water during the election, when he described Barack Obama as a 'light-skinned' African-American 'with no negro dialect.' ... See, that may explain why Reid was the Senate Majority Leader and not the Senate Minority Leader.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But President Obama forgave him. Obama said today, he has 'nothing against really light-skinned people who talk with a cracker dialect.' So it all worked out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you seen him on the news? Harry Reid is apologizing more than NBC affiliates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He is not the only one. Impeached Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich, what a moron this guy is. He's in trouble after saying he's 'blacker than Barack Obama.' Barack Obama? He's not even blacker than Sammy Sosa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A...terrific new book out called 'Game Change' ? it claims during the 2008 election, while Bill Clinton was asking Ted Kennedy to support Hillary, Clinton said of Obama, 'A few years ago,' he 'would have been getting' our coffee. But Clinton says that's not true. He said his real words were, 'Man, I'd like to nail that waitress.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Highlights Of Sarah Palin's First Day At Fox News:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. 'Ruined office floor by drilling for oil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Detached a retina from winking at the camera.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Got confused -- thought she'd signed with QVC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Pistol-whipped three guys who called her 'Tina.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Released a statement saying she won't follow Leno.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. At lunchtime, Todd picked her up driving snowmobile through lobby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Sad to learn there was no actual fox to hunt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Hosted a 'Fire Dave' roundtable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Actually found a place with more white people than Alaska.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Announced plans to run for president in 2010.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A couple of minutes ago, Conan O'Brien, who was the host of 'The Tonight Show' over there at NBC, announced that he would not follow Jay Leno at 12:05. ... If Conan does leave 'The Tonight Show', President Obama then has to appoint a replacement. Did you know that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And now, according to the 'New York Times', al Qaeda is claiming responsibility for the wreckage at NBC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Guess whose birthday it is today. Rush Limbaugh -- 59 years old. ... Also, celebrity birthday, Kirstie Alley --59 years old today, too. This explains the nationwide cake shortage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a big, big week for giant announcements. Have you seen the 'American Idol' show? ... One of the...judges on the show, Simon Cowell, announced this will be the last season on the show. ... Cowell is the only high-ranking judge that Sarah Palin could name.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a new book. Sarah Palin said that on the campaign tour sometimes, she was glassy-eyed and out of it. ... You know, like NBC executives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin is joining Fox News. ... The new slogan is 'hair and unbalanced.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier tonight, Sarah Palin appeared on 'The O'Reilly Factor' with Bill O'Reilly. ... Talk about a bridge to nowhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, the really big news is...Conan O'Brien said in a written statement that he will not do 'The Tonight Show' after Jay Leno. I think. But then he also said he wants to make 'The Tonight Show' the best it can be, which means he didn't quit. I think. I don't know. I have no idea. I'm sure the lawyers will figure that out. ... Actually, I can think of a much better solution than the lawyers. Here's what I think we should do here -- government bailout money. It worked with Wall Street. Why doesn't Congress give NBC money to make more late night shows? That would solve everything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But for now, it looks like Jay's back on at 11:30. Now people are getting their old jobs back. How long before Dick Cheney shows up at the White House? 'Hey Biden, heard you turned my dungeon into breakfast nook. You bastard!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, is in the news. He's still under fire for remarks he made about President Obama's blackness. ... Sources say he could face congressional censure or even worse, be promised 'The Tonight Show' at 11:30.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin made her debut as a Fox News contributor tonight on 'The O'Reilly Factor.' ... I tried to record it but my DVR quit half way through.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big political news out of New Jersey lately. The New Jersey Senate just approved a bill to legalize medical marijuana, a week...after New Jersey voted not to allow gay marriage, which means the New Jersey Senate was like, 'Gay people getting married? What are you, like, high? No? Well, let's get high then.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin is going to be a commentator for Fox News. Well maybe now she can afford to buy some clothes for Levi Johnston.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Plain will be a regular contributor to Fox News. She signed a three-year contract, which means she should be there for, what, six months?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama's approval rating is down to 46%. ... But the White House has an idea for how to get it back up again. What they're going to do is...bring back Bush and Cheney for a week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The 'New York Times' is saying that Fox News has signed Sarah Palin. ... Sarah Palin to be a Fox News contributor. Their slogan is 'fair and balanced,' and now they're going to replace the slogan with 'You betcha!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin says she can see Rupert Murdoch from her front porch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin also said that she...can't wait to start making up the news.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, some good news from Afghanistan. Did you hear about this? Critics of the war have stopped referring to it as another Vietnam. ... The bad news? They're now calling it another NBC.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, a lot of people don't like these airport body scanners. They say they don't like security officials seeing naked images of their bodies. Huh? Have you seen most Americans lately? Come on. It's no picnic for the security people either.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government issued a statement this week saying most people aren't complaining about the full body scanners. See, the government always says that. Every time...there's another intrusion into our privacy, they say most people aren't complaining. Well, of course, most people aren't complaining. You know what happens when you complain at airport security? You get a colonoscopy and wind up on a terrorists watch list.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it's growing more and more likely that California will legalize marijuana. You mean it's not already legal?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what that means? One day in California, you could be buying legalized marijuana at a Wal-Mart from a cashier who's not even legal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin has signed on to become a Fox News correspondent. And in a related story, John McCain just picked up an endorsement deal to be a spokesman for the SCOOTER Store.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a new book out about&quot; the most recent US presidential &quot;campaign. In the book, it says Sarah Palin was unprepared to be vice president. And I thought, boy, you think you know somebody.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin made her debut as a Fox News analyst. ... They finally found a job that she's not under-qualified for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hosting 'The Tonight Show' has been the fulfillment of a lifelong dream to me. And I want to say to the kids out there watching, you can do anything you want in life...unless Jay Leno wants to do it, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a...new...'TV Guide' poll, 83% of voters -- 83% -- want me to stay at 11:35. And here's the interesting part. ... When he heard this poll number, President Obama asked, 'How can I get NBC to screw me over?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new report says that one year after Obama took office, 40% of top positions in his Administration have yet to be filled. George Bush actually filled 62% of top positions during his first year and Bill Clinton filled all the top positions and even some of the weird sideways ones.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new study finds that the increase of obesity in the US is starting to slow, mainly because so many Americans are already fat.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin has a new job. She's joining Fox News Channel to provide political analysis and occasionally host shows.' What?!

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin has signed with Fox News to be a correspondent. Well, in a statement today, Fox said if...Palin does a good job, they'll sign her to a long-time contract. If she doesn't work out, they'll just blame Leno. That's what they said.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, security is being upgraded at airports all across the country. They're really cracking down. In fact, today, Osama bin Laden's name was put on the do-not-fly list.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you folks know what is going on with NBC and...the trouble they're having with Jay Leno and Conan O'Brien? ... I thought this was nice. President Obama invited Jay and Conan to the White House for a beer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our good friend, Sarah Palin, former governor of Alaska, is a contributor to Fox News. ... Only been there a couple days. Already making friends. Today, she loaned Glenn Beck some mascara that does not run when you cry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She's doing a lot of public speaking and next week she will be in Las Vegas speaking at a liquor convention. And what a coincidence because I think McCain was drunk when he picked her.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been reported...that an 8-year-old boy from New Jersey is on the government's airport watch list, because he has the same name as a possible terrorist. ... So, it's been a really bad week for little Skippy bin Laden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's big news out of Washington today. President Obama announced a plan to recover Federal bailout money from banks. I guess that explains why Biden was seen yesterday buying a gun and a ski mask.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an interview with 'People' magazine, Michelle Obama said that she's heard about MTV's 'Jersey Shore,' but she hasn't seen it. It's funny. That's exactly what the people on 'Jersey Shore' said about the Obamas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin started a new job as a contributor to Fox News. The first day there, she sat down with Bill O'Reilly. Went very well. The next day was a visit to perhaps Fox's next-biggest star, Glenn Beck. ... 'Tomorrow, I meet Sarah Palin and family for the first time. I'm actually a little nervous as she is one of the only people that I can see that can possibly lead us out of where we are. I don't know yet if she's strong enough.' Look at Palin's face.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The heaviest snowfall in over 60 years is being reported in Beijing, China. To give you an idea of how bad it is, the army is now having to use snowplows to run over dissidents.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday, President Obama told the bankers that received the bailout money that instead of fighting these new regulations and fees, they should simply consider meeting their responsibilities. Well that's a good strategy. To the guys that screwed us out of billions of dollars, let's appeal to their sense of honesty and fair play. Well, that'll work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you for coming out on Dr. Martin Luther King's birthday. ... As you know, all the banks are closed, and I understand, tomorrow, some of them might even reopen.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to 'Time' magazine, executives at the Wall Street firm of Goldman Sachs were paid an average...of $600,000 last year. And that was just by Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to 'The New York Times,' an eight-year-old boy is on the terrorism watch list because he has the same name as someone on the no-fly list. His mom says he's been on the no-fly list since he was two years old. ... But to be fair, how many flyers would like to see all two-year-olds on the no-fly list?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They have built now, robotic women. ... They're anatomically correct, they have synthetic skin, and they can carry on minimal conversations. As a matter of fact, the Republican Party wants to run one for vice president.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a new book out that says Sarah Palin was an ignoramus who believes Saddam Hussein was behind 9/11. And I thought, well, no, that's George Bush. Wasn't that George Bush?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of Osama bin Laden's sons has written a book. And remember how excited we all were when we captured Osama bin Laden? Oh yeah, that didn't happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, one of his kids has written a book. ... And he said his father was a cruel parent. ... For example, he made the kid wait until he was 18 years old before he let him blow up his first car.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The FBI has released a sketch of what Osama bin Laden looks like now. You know, he's aged. It's been, like, nine years. ... So the FBI puts out a sketch so we can get an idea what he looks like nine years older. And I said, 'Why don't we put out a sketch of what he looks like when he's captured?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you remember Chemical Ali? ... He's been sentenced to death. Now this is the fourth time he's been sentenced to death. ... He's very confused. He hasn't decided what to order for his fourth last meal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House issued a statement today. They're blaming government inefficiencies ? this is true ? they're blaming it on old computers. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House said they're replacing any technology that's obsolete, broken down and causes problems. Desktops, laptops, Joe Biden: It's all going out.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First Lady Michelle Obama said she doesn't let her daughters watch the show 'Jersey Shore.' ... When asked why, the First Lady said, 'Because I love my children.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, President Obama attended his daughter Malia's school recital. Not to see her perform or anything. Just to see if any of the kids had a solution to healthcare. And they didn't.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During Malia's recital, Obama was so proud. He kept turning to other parents saying, 'That's my daughter up there.' And the other parents were like, 'You mean the snowflake surrounded by Secret Service? Yeah, we got it. We know who your daughter is.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone around the country is still focused on healthcare. President Obama recently said, 'We've spent so much time talking about the House bill versus the Senate bill that we haven't been able to talk about how great the bill is overall.' Then someone asked him how great it was and he was like, 'Not that great.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is very sweet. President Obama threw Michelle a surprise birthday party on Saturday night, which is why all week long, Joe Biden was like, 'Hi, Michelle. Nothing new going on here. No secrets being kept, surprises being planned. Certainly no surprise parties. What?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I read that a year into Obama's first term in office, unemployment is higher, the national debt is higher, and there are more soldiers serving in Afghanistan. When asked about it, Obama...was like, 'Yeah, technically that is change.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Friday, the FBI unveiled a massive Times Square billboard with a rotating display of the most wanted criminals in the US. It's all part of a new FBI plan called 'distract tourists while they have their wallets stolen.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's begin tonight in Massachusetts, where tomorrow, voters will go to the polls in a special election to fill the Senate seat that Ted Kennedy held for 46 years, a seat that he won in a special election to replace his brother John, who had won it himself in a super-secret...election to replace his brother, George Kennedy, who had left to go film 'The Dirty Dozen.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, like you, I am super jazzed about tomorrow's special election in Massachusetts to fill Ted Kennedy's vacant Senate seat. Because, folks, this isn't just any election. 'The voters of Massachusetts are well aware that this is a national referendum on the healthcare bill.' 'It's become a national election.' 'Fundamentally, this is a national election.' Thank you! This is the kind of national election I love, the kind that gets decided by one state.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The race is between Democrat Martha Coakley and a Republican I have long supported, Scott, I want to say Brown. Is it Brown? It is Brown? That's why I wanted to say it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the early days of coal mining, it was dirty, dangerous work. ... Thankfully, modern science has found a much safer way to get our coal: Blowing the tops off mountains! Awesome!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's great. You start with some boring, tree-covered mountain, and you turn it into an exciting, lifeless moon base.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Plus, it is the most efficient way to get to the coal inside. That's why when I go to the dentist, I have him remove my teeth through the top of my head.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, unfortunately, not everyone out there gets it, like the EPA. In September, they put 79 mountain removal projects on hold. Who made the EPA the protector of the environment?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, good news, nation, this month the EPA reversed their position and awarded a permit for a 600-acre mine in West Virginia to the Patriot Coal Corporation. You know it's patriotic coal because they're using their bombs bursting in air to turn those purple mountain majesties into amber waves of gray.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know up in Massachusetts, the big election, are you following what's going on up there? Ted Kennedy's Senate seat...is now up for grabs. The election is pretty close. I was thinking, you know, my money is on Jay Leno.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you remember...the Salahis? ... Barack Obama...throws a state dinner for the prime minister of India. And guess who shows up? The Salahis. Well, they weren't invited. ... Tomorrow, they're going to be appearing before Homeland Security to talk about that. It should be exciting. ... Ricky Gervais is hosting. It'll be great.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Chrysler is recalling 24,000 cars. ... May be a problem with the brake system. ... I said to myself, 'Holy crap! They sold 24,000 cars. Really? Well, good for them. I mean, who cares if the brakes work? They're moving cars left and right.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now here's something that I think bothers all of us. Osama bin Laden is still out doing whatever it is he does. And so the FBI...updated his likeness. ... So the FBI has gotten the original photograph and they've enhanced it...to show what Osama bin Laden looks like now. And if you're interested, you can see it. They put it on a carton of goat's milk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just read President Obama plans to deliver his State of the Union address next Wednesday, January 27th. Until then, he's just at home going, 'Please everything get better by Wednesday. Please everything get better by Wednesday.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can tell the President is losing some of his popularity. Today, Obama and Secretary of Education Arne Duncan visited elementary school kids in Virginia. And the kids were like, 'Oh, my gosh. ... It's Arne Duncan! It's Arne Duncan, look! Can I have your autograph? It's Arne Duncan!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Listen to this, in 2009, the FBI reported a 20% decrease in the number of people robbing banks. There was, however, a huge increase in the number of banks robbing people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess it was last February: Federal government called before them the titans of Wall Street for a...bit of a talking to. ... Cut to a year later, thanks to the bailouts, the banks are thriving, bonuses back up to record levels, and these guys still don't get it. Well not for long. A...bipartisan commission charged with finding the causes of the financial crisis has been formed. ... They're coming, Wall Street, and they're going to be writing a report that is due out, in December? That's like, 11 months. ... By then, these bankers are...probably going to be packaging something called breathing swaps. When did my bank add the $45 oxygen to carbon dioxide conversion fee?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, I am sick and tired of Muslim terrorists and their secular progressive soul mates claiming that America is waging a crusade. ... Our military is not engaged in a holy war. And I don't know where they are getting that idea, other than from ABC News. 'Some soldiers call them 'Jesus rifles.' That's because the sights on their guns contain a secret coded reference to New Testament passages about Jesus Christ.' Technically, 'Jesus rifles' aren't a holy war. They're more like an armor-piercing Sunday school.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, these 'Jesus rifles,' as they're called, were manufactured by Trijicon, which ends all serial numbers of their rifle scopes with New Testament verses. 'Here, JN8.12, a reference to the Book of John, Chapter eight, Verse 12, which reads in part, 'Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying I am the light of the world.' And I assume the full verse ends in, 'Eat hot lead, Haji.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's hard to believe President Obama has now been in office for a year. ... And you know, it's incredible. He took something that was in terrible, terrible shape, and he brought it back from the brink of disaster. The Republican Party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know that question, what can brown do for you? Apparently he can stop the Democrats' healthcare plan. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, a big upset victory. Republican Scott Brown defeated Democrat Martha Chokely -- I mean Coakley.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama called Coakley and said, 'Well, we can't win them all.' The same thing he said after the New Jersey governor's race, the Virginia governor's race, 2016 Olympic bid, and the Copenhagen Climate Summit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Democrats had a number of explanations as to why they lost Ted Kennedy's seat. The White House said today, Scott brown won because he ran a 'clever campaign.' And Harry Reid said he won 'because he's a light skinned Brown, with no negro accent.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Sarah Palin, now going to be a VIP guest at next month's Daytona 500. She won't have any official role. So it will be like when she ran for vice president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Republicans elected a new senator from the state of Massachusetts. His name is Scott Brown. That's one of those names they give you in the witness relocation program.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a year ago today that the President moved into the White House. An since that time, his hair's gone gray, he's made some people mad at him, he's let down...quite a lot of his supporters, which makes him perfect for his new job, host of 'The Tonight Show.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was...a big Senate race in Massachusetts yesterday. The winner, Scott brown, made a victory speech where he mentioned his two daughters were available. ... At least this explains his campaign slogan, 'Scott Brown, creepy for Massachusetts, creepy for America.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was a huge Senate race in Massachusetts yesterday. ... Republican Scott Brown pulled off the upset. Now some Democrats are accusing their candidate, Martha Coakley, of running a lackluster campaign. They were especially confused by her campaign slogan, 'I guess we can?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So a Republican won. So, when Scott Brown takes office, Democrats will lose their filibuster-proof Senate majority. And he's vowed to oppose the healthcare bill. That's a nice way to start your first day, huh? 'Hey, I'm the new guy. Hate what you're doing here. Bad to meet you. Not a fan. You are the worst.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new survey found that only 19% of kids give President Obama an A on his first year in office, and 16% gave him an F. Malia was like, 'This is the best possible day to tell dad about my D in social studies. This is so cool.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Erroll Southers, Obama's pick to head the TSA, withdrew his name because he performed an illegal background check on his ex-wife's boyfriend. ... Still, that's an improvement from the TSA's normal procedure -- not performing background checks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big night in the state of Massachusetts. After the smoke had cleared and the chowder-filled vomit was hosed off the streets, the results of their special election to fill Ted Kennedy's vacant Senate seat were decisive: Republican upstart Scott Brown 51.9%, Democrat log bump Martha Coakley 47.1%.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, do you feel the electricity in the room right now? You feel it! And it's all because last night, the Massachusetts Senate seat previously held by liberal lion Ted Kennedy was won by a Republican! ... It was morning in America, the Boston Tea Party, the Battle of Gettysburg, and the all-you-can-eat wing night at Chili's all rolled up into one.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Promised people of Massachusetts he'd bring back witch trials.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. So cold in Boston today he actually put on pants.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody here from Massachusetts? You got a new senator, congratulations. Do you know anything about this guy. His name is Scott Brown. ... Isn't that the guy Elvis played in 'Clambake'?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So let's talk a look at this deal now. Massachusetts elects a Republican who drives a truck with 200,000 miles on it. It's a Chevy truck. Which is more hard to believe now? Massachusetts elects a Republican or Chevy builds a truck that lasts 200,000 miles?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But you know...the Democratic candidate, was like, two weeks ago, ahead by 20 points. ... And she blew it. Here's what happened. ... Apparently, she put in the Patriots defense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama says he blames himself for the upset in the Massachusetts Senate race because he was too remote. ... Meanwhile, today in Arizona, John McCain couldn't find his remote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;NBC and I have finally reached a separation agreement. ... I'd like to apologize to the guests that were scheduled for next week. President Barack Obama, the pope, the queen of England, and our good friend, Elvis Presley, was stopping by.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, today officially marks the beginning of President Obama's second year in office. ... He has three years left, but NBC offered him $45 million to leave altogether. So, we'll see what happens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During his acceptance speech Tuesday, newly elected Senator Scott Brown told the crowd that two of his older daughters are both available. Man, so many great American speeches, right? 'Four score and seven years ago,' 'ask not what your country can do for you,' 'I have a dream', and now, 'my daughters are both available.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Supreme Court ruled today that the government cannot stop corporations from spending money on political candidates. This explains why Sarah Palin just accepted $1 million to change her name to Pizza Hut.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Supreme Court today...ruled in a five votes to four decision that corporations can now spend as much as they want on political campaigns. In other words, if Exxon or Dow wants to support a candidate, they can give him or her as much money as they want. ... I can't see that having any negative repercussions, can you?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The court ruled that corporations should be given the same right to free speech as people, which is ? I mean, corporations are not people, and if they were people, they'd be real jerks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former presidential candidate John Edwards has finally admitted that he did father a love child with his former mistress, Rielle Hunter. ... How does that work? Do you still hand out cigars? ... Should I send something?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And by the way, is love child really the best way of describing what happened? ... I think it was more of a seven gin and tonics child.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He released a statement today. Edwards said, 'It was wrong for me ever to deny she was my daughter and hopefully one day, when she understands, she'll forgive me.' Hey, if she inherits that hair, what's to forgive?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'We have that bombshell statement now from Sen. John Edwards admitted that he fathered a child with former campaign worker, Rielle Hunter.' 'Quoting now: 'I am Quinn's father. It was wrong for me to ever deny she was my daughter and hopefully one day, when she understands, she' will forgive me.' 'Hopefully one day she'll forgive me.' I think that's something John Edwards pretty much could add to every sentence he says from now on in his life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, once again there's trouble brewing in Afghanistan. According to 'The New York Times' Taliban leader Mullah Omar has issued a 'new code of conduct' banning suicide bombing, 'burning down schools' and 'cutting off ears, lips and tongues.' It is all part of a 'public relations campaign' to 'soften their image.' ... Now I'm sure a lot of people were on the fence about these guys before, but now that they've stopped cutting off ears, lips and tongues, they're appealing to a broader demo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday was the one year anniversary of Barack Obama's inauguration. I'll never forget where I was that day: At Kinko's, making a fake Kenyan birth certificate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But one year later I have to ask: Has Barack Obama failed? Or has he succeeded, at failing?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We all love celebrity birthdays. You know whose birthday it is today? ... Yakov Smirnoff. Famous Russian comedian, 59 years old, and he celebrated. Spent the entire day waving to Sarah Palin.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Obama met with a group of mayors at the White House. He told them that he was glad not to be running a city during this recession. It's part of Obama's new campaign slogan, 'Sucks to be you.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if you guys remember this. Obama wanted to close the Guantanamo Bay prison by today, but it turns out he's going to miss his deadline by a full year. Imagine what would happen at your job if you miss a deadline by a year? 'Hey, Gary, been waiting on that Johnson report for -- well, it's been a year now. ... Maybe think about wrapping it up, maybe getting it on my desk. I'd definitely like to see it by the end of this year, maybe, huh. Take your time, Gary.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You guys following the big healthcare fight? Not going well for the Democrats at all. Nancy Pelosi said yesterday that the House doesn't have enough votes to pass the Senate's healthcare bill. ... A few more elections and the House won't have Nancy Pelosi either.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been raining here in Los Angeles all week. ... People are evacuating their homes in areas that are vulnerable to mudslides. Is it me or has this state had nothing but disasters since Arnold Schwarzenegger took over as governor?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We may need to throw him into a volcano, because it's getting ridiculous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to 'The New York Times,' the Taliban is trying to soften their image to appeal to the people of Afghanistan. And in fact, Mullah Omar, whose one of their managers, I think, issued a new code of conduct...which dictates that there will be no suicide bombings against Afghani civilians, no burning down schools, and no cutting off the ears, nose, or tongue. That seems reasonable to me.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain's wife...and her daughter, Meghan, have posed for pictures endorsing pro-gay marriage here in California, although Senator McCain -- well, he's still very traditional. He believes marriage should be between an older man and a really hot-looking younger woman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, I saw John McCain today. He and John Edwards were at the same store. They were both buying diapers, but for different reasons.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As I'm sure you know, John Edwards has finally admitted he's the father of Rielle Hunter's baby. There's a shock. Who saw that coming? Given how long it took him to admit it, the kid is now old enough not to vote for him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, John Edwards said today he's going to help raise the little girl. He said he's looking forward to teaching his daughter everything he knows about hair care products.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And learning more and more about the new Massachusetts senator, Scott brown. Well, you probably know this. Back in 1982, posed naked for 'Cosmo.' Yeah, isn't that amazing? He's got it backwards. First you get elected to the Senate, then you get caught with your pants down. It's the other way. He seems to be very confused.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this is kind of embarrassing. At a speech to school kids in an elementary school in Virginia, President Obama used the teleprompter. He had a teleprompter set up to talk to the kids. The topic of the speech: Never taking the easy way out by bringing a cheat sheet to school.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congratulations to the Indianapolis Colts and the New Orleans Saints. They're going to the Super Bowl. ... The Saints beat the Vikings. ... Former President George Bush Sr., he was at the...game. Now, his son, George W., was invited, but you know him, when it comes to New Orleans, he's always, like, two weeks late.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the halftime show is The Who this year. ... NFL officials are concerned now that Brett Favre's out of the Super Bowl, because he's the only player old enough to know who The Who are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not always easy to fill a half hour comedy program. ... That's why we here are especially grateful for those frequent contributors, those who give more than their fair share, like the state of South Carolina, whose...governors use taxpayer funds to fly to Argentina to see their mistress. ... But what has South Carolina done for us lately? ... &quot;Feeding stray animals.' That's the metaphor Lieutenant Governor Andre Bauer used to describe families who receive free or reduced price meals in public schools.' Free lunch kids are 'stray animals'? Oh, I see why the governor's still there. Because the guy who would replace him, the lieutenant governor, is a nightmare. Oh, South Carolina, you just keep on giving, don't you?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'The President of the United States, Barack Obama, was summoned for jury duty in Cook County. The White House contacted the court system there to say that he was unavailable to serve.' He's not serving jury duty?! I've been called for duty a dozen times, and they never let me go when I tell them I'm President.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I say if President Obama wants to get out of jury duty, he should do what the rest of us do. Show up, wet yourself, get in a fistfight with the stenographer, and tell the judge that you are afraid of Koreans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But folks, Barack Obama's got a bigger problem than dodging jury duty: The economy. ... That's why on Friday the President traveled to Ohio to give this speech. 'I'm not going to stop fighting until we have jobs for everybody!' Mr. President, talk is cheap. Though due to soaring unemployment, no one can afford it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think the President understands that in America, consumption equals jobs. And these days, banks aren't lending us the money we need to buy the things we don't need to create the jobs we need to pay back the loans we can't afford.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former sitcom star Scott Baio...got death threats over a distasteful tweet he made regarding First Lady Michelle Obama. It took death threats to remind us that Scott Baio is still alive!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Death threats for Scott Baio. Apparently, not everybody loves Chachi.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So he contacted the FBI to investigate death threats. But you can't make a distasteful tweet about the First Lady, and then call a government agency. They're not going to take your call. 'Like, yeah, uh-huh, ok.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Focus on jobs. This is going to be the shortest speech in history. 'Hey, there aren't any. Thank you. Good night.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama has now been called for jury duty in Chicago. ... I think he should go. I mean, the economy is in bad shape. We could use...five bucks a day. Every little bit helps.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger announced that California can save money by no longer incarcerating illegal immigrants and just sending them to Mexico instead. Well, actually, today, the immigrants had three words for Schwarzenegger --- 'I'll be back.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More problems for Goldman Sachs. Did you know the tax rate it paid on its profits last year was .6%? ... And of course, the CEO of Goldman Sachs was furious when he heard this. He said, 'What? When did we start paying taxes? This is ridiculous.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wal-Mart announced it's cutting over 11,000 jobs. Wal-Mart said it's cheaper to fire people in bulk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's an amazing amount of people: 11,000 jobs. The problem is they made the announcement in English, so everybody kept showing up for work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Osama bin Laden has issued a new audio tape praising the failed Christmas Day airline bombing and...warning more attacks to come to the United States.' ... Bin Laden comments on the Christmas underwear bomber now? That was like a month ago. ... You should change your name to Osama bin Procrastinating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As many of you are aware, this financial crisis is creating a little bit of tension between Wall Street titans and the other 6.5 billion people on Earth. And after handing over billions of dollars in bailout funds to banks, President Obama may have had enough. 'The President, noting the outrage in this country after the financial collapse, said it's time to go after the banks and the bankers, and if they want a fight, they'll get one.' Don't fight him, bankers! It's a trap. He has an army.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I mean, what weapon does Wall Street have? 'The third consecutive triple-digit loss for the Dow since the President came out swinging against the banks on Wednesday.' Oh my God, they're taking hostages! 'If you ever want to see your 401(k) again, I suggest you put down your regulations. No, no, I'm serious. I will decrease your...dividends.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why is this happening? 'We would have been up huge on earnings today if it weren't for the President's decision to downsize the banking system.' 'The market hates the Obama plan.' 'Everything that we've seen coming out of Washington, the market doesn't like it.' 'Investor confidence was completely shattered by what you got from the Obama Administration. 'The market does not like nationalization.' 'The market hates this. It hates the stimulus. It hates the bailouts.' Well then give us back our...money!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess that explains why the market is up 16% since Obama took over and it's up 30% since the stimulus package was signed and why the banks have posted record profits. I mean, they're doing it, they're just probably not happy about it. You know, they said Obama was going to redistribute the wealth. They never said which direction. See, I figured this out. Obama's a socialist but he's also dyslexic.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, tonight in Washington,&quot; President Barack Obama &quot;gave his...State of the Union address before a joint session of Congress. Joint session sounds like more fun than it is.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The speech tonight was pretty much the same thing we hear over and over again, asking us...for patience and a willingness to sacrifice, things we are totally unwilling to do as Americans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But then after the President spoke, the Republicans gave their rebuttal, during which they pointed out that Obama has repeatedly failed to solve any of the problems they created under President Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Neither one of these parties cares as much about the country as they do about being the one who gets to run the country. It's a big waste, and it's a big waste of air time that could be better spent on celebrities ice skating or conveyor belts of love, things like that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Right now, you all probably know the State of the Union address just ended, about an hour, or some, ago. ... Biden, wear some pants?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been a week since the Democratic Party was stung in the Massachusetts Senate special election race by the upset victory of Republican Scott Brown over challenger Uninspiry T. Nothington.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And that loss really got Republicans thinking about what Obama could do better. 'I think the only way he stops a Republican landslide in November is if he moves to the middle.' 'I hope he moves to the center and stops pursuing this extraordinary left wing agenda.' 'And he will move to the political center, I think he'll find a lot more Republican support.' What, wait, what? Wait, what?! Where is the Republican support in the center? Are...you talking about Lieberman?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama made his State of the Union address tonight. For those...who didn't get a chance to see it, let me sum up what he said. Pretty much, he said, 'I can never do nothing in the White House! ... I thought it was going to be more fun, but everybody keeps talking about me. I hate 'em!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The world champion Los Angeles Lakers visited the White House! ... They met President Obama this week and it was the first time a sitting president actually knew all the names of the NBA players... instead of referring to them as 'all those tall black buys.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many of you watched President Obama's State of the Ruin, uh, State of the Union address?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well in his speech, President Obama said, number one priority, saving jobs. His job, Joe Biden's, Harry Reid's, Nancy Pelosi's...&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Obama's press secretary, Robert Gibbs, he said that President Obama plans his budget a lot like the average American family -- spend like crazy, run up your credit card and worry about paying for it later.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know what annoys me? Republicans are all criticizing President Obama for using a...teleprompter when he gives a speech. Is that a big deal, using the teleprompter? You know, after...eight years of George Bush, I'm glad we have a president that can read.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in his latest audiotape, Osama bin Laden...said al Qaeda was going to bring down one of our older monuments. You know what that meant? It was Brett Favre. They were working with New Orleans, yes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Great Britain has proposed a half a billion dollar fund to create jobs for...Taliban members who agree to lay down their arms. The program is called 'Moolah for Mullahs.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Terrorists are now trying to buy Botox because the key ingredient in Botox can be used to kill people. ... You know what that means? Nancy Pelosi is a WMD.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And some sad news. Elizabeth Edwards announced she has separated from her husband. ... Of course, John Edwards was shocked. 'What, I was married, what?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, John Edwards said today, he's looking forward to moving on with his life, meeting someone special and then cheating on them.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you all watch the President's speech the other night? ... Hillary Clinton didn't attend the speech. .... She said today she would not serve another term as secretary of state. Apparently, she wants to do something else in 2012. Gee, I wonder what that could be.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama has proposed a freeze on government spending next year. ... Well, that sounds like the worst New Year's resolution, doesn't it? 'I'm going to quit drinking and smoking, next year. I'm going to lose 20 pounds next year.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in London this week, a half a billion dollar British-American backed fund was proposed to pay Taliban fighters to lay down their weapons to stop fighting. ... So, the good news is America is creating jobs. Oh, sure, they're all for terrorists, but we're making jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Osama bin Laden has released another tape. He released a tape today, blaming the United States for global warming. Well, you can tell he's running out of ideas. That's the best he's got? Hey, the United States blames the United States for global warming!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sounds like someone wants to quit al Qaeda and join Al Gore. I think that's what's going to happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, maybe it's not global warming that's affecting Osama bin Laden. Maybe it's the fact that he lives in a cave in the middle of a desert. Okay? That might ? 'Ooh, it's hot in here!' That might have something to do with it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today, scientists at UCLA announced they have discovered the lowest form of life -- John Edwards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Elizabeth Edwards announced that she and John have separated. So, it looks like it's not just Nancy Pelosi that's going to lose the House this year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, apparently it was something that was bothering Elizabeth. I think it was called a baby.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And for the first time in four years, Ford is reporting a profit of $2.7 billion. They attribute it to the fact that they are building better cars, and that Toyotas are crashing and Hondas are bursting into flames.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you heard. Toyota having a big recall-a-thon! ... Recalling something like 2.3 million cars. The cars may suffer from unintended acceleration. The accelerator can stick to the floor, which is scary. In fact, some Priuses have been seen on the freeway going as high as 48 miles an hour.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to a new study, Las Vegas has more foreclosures than any other city in the country. In fact, times are so tough; you know the casino New York, New York? They...changed their name to Newark, New Jersey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And some sad news. J.D. Salinger, the reclusive author of 'The Catcher in the Rye', has passed away at the age of 91, after a long battle with teen angst. I just threw that one in for me. The show has been canceled. I like that joke.&quot;</SPAN></P>
