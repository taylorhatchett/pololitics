<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Chris Christie was having a feud...with the mayor of Fort Lee, New Jersey. So, he closed down the George Washington Bridge. It was traffic snarled up for hundreds of miles. Day after day. I'm telling you, this guy, you can't say power hungry without hungry, you know what I mean.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President of the United States of New Jersey, Chris Christie, is in hot water. ... New emails link top aides in the Christie Administration to a shutdown on the George Washington Bridge back in September. It was traffic on a biblical scale, with New Jersey highways backed up for days, which is slightly longer than normal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, it turns out, turns out, folks, that the lane closures were meant to make life hell as payback to the mayor of [Fort Lee] New Jersey for not endorsing Christie for re-election. No word yet on what the rest of New Jersey is payback for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama's former Defense Secretary, Robert Gates, has written a new memoir where he says that Joe Biden has been wrong on almost every foreign policy issue in the last 40 years. ... Says he's awful when it comes to foreign countries. Then Biden was like, 'Hey, is this about the time I got lost at Epcot?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House is planning to air some ads for Obamacare during the Winter Olympics next month. It makes sense, if you think about it. Obamacare went downhill fast, left people cold, and then, somehow, it managed to skate by. That's good marketing right there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, the Olympics are a lot like Obamacare, you know, because they both take around four years to get it together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I see that the First Lady, Michelle Obama, is still in Hawaii and get this, she's staying at Oprah's house. And Oprah's not there, but she did leave a list of house-sitting instructions for the first lady. Take a look. First, she says, 'Sorry, the living room is a mess, but feel free to use any of the other 37 living rooms.' Next, she says, 'The keys to the helicopter are in the second helicopter.' Next, she says, 'If you feel like watching a movie, just have Steven Spielberg write and direct one for you.' And finally, 'Don't talk to the human chess set in the backyard. That's just common.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's some more political news. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie just signed a major pro-immigration bill yesterday. Christie said everyone deserves a chance, no matter if you're a Mexican, Asian, Indian, Italian or any other kind of restaurant or person.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Georgia Congressman Jack Kingston &quot;is coming under attack for suggesting that poor students who are part of the school lunch program - that they should be forced to do janitorial work around the school, so they can learn that there is no such thing as a free lunch. And believe me, if anybody knows about getting a free lunch, it's a United States Congressman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Critics are accusing President Obama of having attention deficit disorder. He responded to the accusation by saying, 'That is ridiculous. Look, a bird. No, just waiting.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A member of Congress said that unemployment benefits basically pay people to not work. ... He said the only people who should be paid for not working are members of Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has had a bad couple of days. He's embroiled in a major scandal involving lane closures near the George Washington Bridge. One of his top aides allegedly ordered the lane closure to retaliate against the mayor of Fort Lee, who refused to support Governor Christie's re-election. A lot of people got stuck in terrible traffic. Ambulances had a hard time getting through. Blocking off bridges, you know, intentionally. To put that in perspective, that's what Bane did in the last Batman movie. It's a big deal. ? The scandal could damage Christie's chances of getting the Republican nomination for president in 2016, but he'll probably bounce back. He seems like a pretty bouncy person.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey, apparently some goons in his office closed the George Washington Bridge as a prank. And they have the emails to prove it. Now, this is what I don't understand. You got a major political figure. You have the busiest bridge in the world. Don't put anything in writing. ? Do what I always do when I have something top secret to discuss. I go to the bowling alley and use the pay phone.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Christie is saying he knew nothing about it. It was all his aides. He had no knowledge of the closing of the bridge. He is trying to distance himself from the scandal. And this is a big guy. You want to distance yourself from something when you're that big, you got to go to Mars.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been a lousy week for Governor Christie. I mean, first the bridge scandal and now the nationwide Velveeta shortage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Governor Christie's office is accused of shutting down a bridge to get back at a mayor who won't endorse him. It's all very petty, but shutting down the bridge caused four-hour delays. Or as it's known in Los Angeles, 'three blocks at rush hour.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone's talking about Chris Christie today. He's a Republican, so MSNBC says, 'He's guilty.' Fox News says, 'Give him a chance.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government is cracking down on companies that say they can help you lose weight. The Obama Administration accused four weight-loss companies of misleading Americans about their health benefits. And the companies said, 'Couldn't we say the same about you?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Referring to Christie scandal) &quot;Bottom line, bottom line, no one can definitively prove the original order came from Chris Christie. But I would like to go on the record as saying, God, I hope it did. Because a year ago when I saw him palling around with Barack Obama after Hurricane Sandy, I was worried he was one of those fake conservatives who secretly believes that the government can do things. But now I realize he's the kind of leader I can get behind. The kind who says it's my way or I shut down your highway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Christie is a true conservative. He is committed to proving the core conservative value that government is the problem, even if he has to create those problems himself. I can already see his 2016 bumper sticker: 'Christie. Bringing America Together Or I Will [bleep] You Over.' Best of all, his team will make sure you have plenty of time to read those bumper stickers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Referring to Robert Gates' memoir) &quot;Secretary Gates writes&quot; of &quot;the President's Afghanistan strategy, 'I believe Obama was right in his decisions, but I myself, our commanders and our troops, had expected more commitment to the cause and more passion for it from him.' Yes, Obama made the right decisions, but he faked his war-gasm. Secretary Gates much preferred President Bush, who 'had no second thoughts about Iraq, including our decision to invade.' No second thoughts. I'm pretty sure he didn't have first thoughts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you may have heard, New Jersey Republican, I believe his name is Christopher Christie, faced an outcry yesterday after it was revealed his staffers purposely tied up traffic for days at the Fort Lee, New Jersey, side of the George Washington Bridge as payback against the town's Democratic mayor, because, apparently, being right there at the bridge isn't punishment enough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is dealing with a scandal after it was revealed that a top aide shut down access to the George Washington Bridge to get back at a Democratic mayor for not endorsing him. Christie was furious when they blocked the bridge, because he thought they said they were blocking the fridge. He was like, 'What?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, though, Chris Christie held a press conference today to address the bridge scandal, where he insisted that he is not a bully. And he will sit on anyone who says otherwise.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, President Obama announced a new plan to create things called 'promise zones' in parts of the country where the economy still needs help. 'Promise zones'? Sounds less like an economic plan, more like something your parents would say during the sex talk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Obama gave photographers a rare chance to take pictures of his weekly lunch with Joe Biden. Then Biden told his friends, 'Told you I knew the President.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this has turned into a huge scandal. Apparently somebody in Governor Christie's office, as you know, was involved in that traffic-lane closure at the George Washington Bridge that?caused a huge traffic jam. And the allegation is, it was done in retaliation against the mayor of Fort Lee for not supporting Christie's re-election campaign. But Christie is denying any personal involvement. He said he was too busy clogging his own arteries at the time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pundits are saying this could hurt his 2016 presidential campaign. The ironic thing is, now that Christie is denying everything, he sounds even more presidential, doesn't he?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, after his denial, Christie quickly left the news conference to deal with a more personal crisis, the Velveeta cheese shortage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in the new movie 'The Wolf of Wall Street,' they say the 'F' word was used a record 506 times, thus breaking the old record of 505 times, set by President Obama when he heard about Robert Gates' new book.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new study, prolonged sitting around can be as unhealthy for you as smoking. They say sitting around all day and doing nothing can actually kill you. Naturally, these findings scare the hell out of Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last week, a New Jersey state Senator said he will introduce a bill to legalize marijuana in New Jersey. Today, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie promised to veto it, saying, 'You do not want to see me get the munchies.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After the President's State of the Union address, there will be three separate Republican rebuttals.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Referring to President Obama's State of the Union Address] &quot;This was a very important speech for the President tonight, and he gave it at a time when he's losing support from his own party. In fact, congressional Democrats were warned tonight that if they didn't applaud the President's speech, he would go out and campaign for them.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's a little bit of State of the Union trivia. Did you know the State of the Union speech is also called 'date night' on Capitol Hill? Senators and House members pair up as dates. They pair up with someone with the other party and sit next to each other during the President's speech. They try to sit next to someone who is the complete opposite of what they are. For example, Harry Reid sat with someone who is alive.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During a speech yesterday, Hillary Clinton said she still doesn't know if she's running for president in 2016. ... Just like I don't know if I'm going to be having a beer on St. Patrick's Day.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did any of you watch President Obama's State of the Union Address last night? (Applause) Why don't I believe any of you? President Obama said the state of the union is strong, which is something the President says every year. Just once I would like to hear a president say the state of the union is dope. We could use some dopeness.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Referring to incident in which Congressman Michael Grimm threatened a reporter] &quot;That's not appropriate behavior for a public servant. You don't threaten them. You close a bridge in their town. That's how you do it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Referring to President Obama's State of the Union Address] &quot;Obama said other stuff too, but the real highlight of every State of the Union is the Republican response. And last night was so historical. The Republicans brought their A-game, as in a lot of people talking. You had your Mike Lee for the tea partiers, Rand Paul for the other tea partiers and Cuban American Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen for Los Party Grande del Tea. No matter what kind of Republican you are, there was a speech for you, like your own personal sleep number, but for rage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Referring to President Obama's State of the Union Address] &quot;So, to sum up the 2014 State of the Union: a litany of vague pledges, a justified venting of frustration with Congress, and capping it, the world's [expletive] Republican open-mike night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, of course, was the State of the Union Address. And during his speech, President Obama promised to focus on economic growth, education, and healthcare. Or as people tuning in put it, 'Oh...it's a rerun.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, as you know, President Obama gave his State of the Union address last night. I thought he had a very good speech. ... President Obama said he wants to give America a raise. Just waiting, of course, for final approval from China. As soon as they say it's okay, then we'll move ahead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President said that unemployment is dropping, but critics claim it doesn't include people who have left the work force. Hey, how about people who are asked to leave the work force like me?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During an interview after President Obama's speech last night, New York Republican Congressmen Michael Grimm threatened to throw a reporter over the Capitol balcony when the reporter asked him about an investigation of campaign finances. He swore at the guy, and he threatened to throw him over the balcony. See, I don't think the reporter has anything to worry about. When is the last time a congressman kept his word?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a pretty impassioned speech last night. President Obama asked the Americans to pitch in and help those who are most down on their luck. Like the Lakers. I think he mentioned them by name.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A former speechwriter for George W. Bush accused President Obama of plagiarizing one of the speeches. He denied the claim, and so did his speechwriter, Shia Labeouf.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a new interview that just came out, Jerry Springer said that he would want President Obama as a son. In response, Obama said, 'Thanks, but I'll stick to not having a dad, ok? I'm good.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Once again this year, President Obama will grant an interview to a journalist from the network broadcasting the&quot; Super Bowl. &quot;The game is on Fox this year, so Bill O'Reilly is going to do the interview. That makes sense, because, you know, Super Bowl Sunday, most people just want to get together with their friends, eat nachos, drink beers and watch people fight about healthcare reform. I'm taking O'Reilly with the points.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, President Obama - by the way, I wouldn't give that guy's troubles to a monkey on a rock. They had the State of the Union address, and the ratings were very low for the State of the Union address. And I gave this some thought. I think I know why the ratings were low. Because it's the State of the Union address. That's why. Next year it will be presented by Tina Fey and Amy Poehler.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just read this today. The Broncos safety Mike Adams, you guys know that guy? He says that if his team wins the Super Bowl, he's going to walk 12 miles to his hometown in Paterson, New Jersey, after the game. That's pretty good. Thanks to Chris Christie, it's probably the fastest way to get there anyway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;NSA leaker Edward Snowden was just nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize. ... When Snowden asked where he could pick up the award, the organizers said, 'Um, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue? Come alone. Come alone.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Joe Biden said that Hillary Clinton's decision to run for president won't affect his decision to launch a campaign. While Hillary says Joe Biden's decision to run for president won't affect her becoming president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our hearts go out to the people in the South. This terrible storm just crippled that part of the country, pretty bad. Atlanta came to a standstill. You probably saw this. Roadways were blocked, thousands of abandoned cars all over the highway. A lot of people are blaming the mayor. But today, an email surfaced from a Chris Christie aide that said, 'Time for weather problems in Atlanta.' So I don't know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week in New Orleans, Hillary Clinton said she still doesn't know if she's running for president in 2016. Isn't that unbelievable? There are 315 million Americans. What are the odds? She's the only one in the country who doesn't know she's running for president in 2016. It's amazing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This has become a huge story. After the President's State of the Union address, Republican Representative Michael Grimm of New York got into some hot water after he threatened to throw a reporter off a balcony. He said, 'I'll throw you off the effing balcony.' That's what he said. This happened after the reporter questioned him about alleged misuse of campaign funds. So, the good news - any injuries suffered by the reporter would be covered under Obamacare. So that worked out okay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to 'The New York Post', New York Governor Andrew Cuomo is cracking down on welfare recipients who use their government credit cards for things like strip clubs, alcohol and gambling. Cuomo was very clear. He said, 'You want to use taxpayer money for that kind of thing, you become a congressmen, okay?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A petition to have Justin Bieber deported got over 100,000 signatures, which means the White House now has to legally rule on it. So, finally a chance for Obama to issue an executive order that both Republicans and Democrats can agree on. Finally, this could be the thing that brings the country together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Super Bowl this year will be played in Governor Chris Christie's home state of New Jersey. It's a state that lately has gotten used to 300-pound guys blocking things.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The office of Governor Chris Christie is extremely displeased with the sloppy reporting displayed by 'The New York Times' in their coverage of the accusations made by former Port Authority Chief David Wildstein.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, nobody believed me when I said Obamacare was a job killer. And now it is. It's only a matter of time before they roll out the death panels and elder catapults.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;?Obamacare gives people healthcare options allowing them to work less if they choose. But what looks better on a bumper sticker: 'Obamacare job killer. Vote GOP.' Or 'Obamacare's estimated reduction in the workforce stems almost entirely from a net decline in the amount of labor that workers choose to supply rather than from a net drop in businesses' demand for labor. Vote Democrat.' Besides, besides, people should be chained by their need for insurance to jobs they hate. That is what built this country. You think anyone wanted to be a Pilgrim? No!

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You see, for years the President has been dragging his feet on...the Keystone XL pipeline, which would drastically increase our nation's supply of oil, as well as our nation's supply of pipe. Now, for a while Obama insisted he couldn't complete the project, because the nation's best pipe-fitters were busy saving Princess Peach. Then, he claimed he couldn't approve anything until he got the environmental-impact report. Well, last week his strategic-excuse reserve ran dry.&quot; [Referring to the findings in the environmental-impact report] &quot;Bottom line, the pipeline will provide us with much needed fossil fuels.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;?The President's own study says the environmental impact is negligible, 'because most of Alberta's oil will find a way to get to market anyway - if not by pipeline, then by rail.' It's inevitable, and if something is inevitable, then America should be the one to do it. ? Case in point, it's inevitable that climate change is going to melt the ice caps. So, I say we drown the polar bears in the San Diego Zoo. We just charge people a couple hundred bucks a head to watch. Then, you give the money to the World Wildlife Fund and they can use it to save the polar bears, because otherwise, those guys are doomed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, over the years, people always wanted to know whether Letterman and I actually dislike each other. It's not true. We like each other.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, I am so glad, I am so glad to hear that you are happy, because I used to be happy. But I learned something today that shook me to my core. And once my core is shaken, don't come a knocking. Here's the deal. Remember that one time I mentioned in passing that Obama is plotting to radically alter the founder's vision for America? He is. Ben Franklin would be horrified by Obamacare. It doesn't even cover leech-craft or bone-purging for female hysteria.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But folks, what is most insidious about Obama's agenda is how it's now brainwashing our children. Take Michelle Obama's 'Let's Move' campaign to combat childhood obesity. [Video of Kim Jong-Un appears] Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. No, that's North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un. It's so easy to mistake the two. They both look great in pant suits.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Worst of all, this is bad news for the GOP. They need to reach out to the preschool demo.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the next presidential election is still two years off, but speculation is already underway.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Arizona state legislature passed a law that made it legal for businesses to deny service to gay customers. And Tucker Carlson told Fox News this week, 'If I want to bake you a cake for your gay wedding, that's called tolerance. But when you try and force me to bake a cake for your gay wedding, and threaten me with prison if I don't, that's called fascism.' I think the more important issue is, who is asking Tucker Carlson to bake all these wedding cakes?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Referring to a Federal judge overturning the Texas ban on gay marriage] &quot;Texas State Senator Dan Patrick did not celebrate that ruling. He's running for lieutenant governor. He's a very vocal opponent of same-sex marriage. But this is what he tweeted yesterday. He tweeted, 'Marriage equals one man and one man. Enough of these activist judges. Favorite it if you agree. I know the silent majority is out there with us.' Not great with math, but I'm pretty sure that one man and one man, that's two men, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I'm sorry, apparently all straight people are now legally required to make wedding cakes for gay people, because last night, Arizona governor and diner waitress working a 60-hour shift, Jan Brewer, vetoed SB-1062, a bill protecting my religious right to deny Sodomites pastry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Referring to a Stanford professor's study on the US Bureau of Labor Statistics' National Longitudinal Survey of Youth] &quot;It...tracked young people over 19 years to see how their lives had changed, and one of the researchers, Stanford sociologist Aliya Saperstein, found something truly shocking.&quot; Unidentified Speaker: &quot;Saperstein found that the racial classification of people in the survey seemed to change over time.&quot; Colbert: &quot;Yes, your race can change over time. Much like in the winter, John Boehner fades from pumpkin to butternut.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seth Meyers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This situation in the Ukraine is still a very big story. You know, they overthrew their government. And then their president, Viktor Yanukovych, he went on the run. He's hanging out somewhere, partying. And there are reports now that Russia has granted protection to Yanukovych. When Edward Snowden heard that, he was like, 'Top bunk!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seth Meyers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is very controversial. Yesterday, a Federal judge overturned the ban on gay marriage in Texas. ? Of course, a lot of people disagreed with this. In fact, one state senator, his name's Dan Patrick, got so mad he went on Twitter just to make his case against gay marriage. ? I guess he was so upset that he accidentally tweeted that marriage should be between one man and one man. His name is Dan Patrick. Even his name is one man plus one man. Dan Patrick. You can swap them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seth Meyers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama told his supporters that they are doing God's work by helping promote Obamacare. Then God said, 'Hey, look, I'm flattered. But Obamacare, that's all you, man. ? I don't want anything to do with that mess. I couldn't even log in. I don't know what's happening.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, the world is still focused on the ongoing conflict in the Ukraine. And over the weekend, Sarah Palin reminded everyone that during the 2008 election, she predicted Russia would invade the Ukraine. Then John McCain said, 'Well at least one of us made a good call.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And get this - Secretary of State John Kerry went on 'Meet the Press' yesterday, and actually criticized Russia for its action in the Ukraine. He said, quote, 'You don't just invade another country on phony pretext in order to assert your interest.' Then he said, 'I mean, we stopped doing that, like, months ago. Okay? We don't do that anymore.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And while all of this is going on [Russian troops entering Ukraine], President Obama is staying very busy. That's right. On Friday, President Obama took a selfie with Bill Nye the Science Guy and astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, the Russians are at it again. Over the weekend, they - you know, the Olympics are done, they have nothing to do - so they invade Crimea. And so President Obama is steamed. And he says to Putin, he said, 'Look, pull your troops out of Crimea or the US will not attend the next G-8 summit.' And I said, 'Well that will show him. By God, that will teach him. Wait a minute. Putin will think twice about it now. Last thing he wants to do is offend the United States so they stay home from a summit meeting. That looks pretty bad on your record.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, House Speaker John Boehner referred to Vladimir Putin as a thug, then called on President Obama to stand up to him. Which is sort of like throwing your drink on a big guy at a bar and then being like, 'My friend here will take you.' I personally wouldn't mess with him.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Senator John McCain said that the situation in Ukraine is the result of a feckless foreign policy by the White House. The guy he was talking to asked for a handkerchief to wipe off his face. He was like, 'All right, come on. Don't say it again.' Frankly, I'm fed up. That's right, McCain said it's the result of Obama's feckless foreign policy. Then Obama was like, 'What the feck did you say about my foreign policy?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't celebrate too soon, folks, because barreling down on 2016 like a cement truck with its brakes cut is Hillary Clinton. Just last week I broke the story that Fox News broke the story that Hillary suffered from a rare, debilitating condition doctors called aging.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Obama unveiled his budget for 2015 and, no big surprise, Republicans immediately came out and started criticizing it. House Speaker John Boehner even said it's Obama's most irresponsible budget yet. Then Boehner said, 'And if you think that's harsh, wait 'til I actually read it! Then I'm really going to tell you what's on my mind.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama's defending the budget, though, which he's referring to as a road map for creating jobs. Then young people said, 'A what for creating what? Road map? Job? I've never heard of either of those things.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this is the thing in Obama's new budget, it actually includes a proposal to phase out pennies and nickels to make the government more efficient. And to make grandparents better tippers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some more news out of D.C. I saw the city council just approved a measure to decriminalize possession of small amounts of marijuana. At least now Congress will be passing something. That's a good thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, the big international story continues to be the conflict in the Ukraine. Russia is threatening to invade, and the US is stepping in. In fact, just yesterday the US gave one billion dollars to the Ukraine to help stabilize the region. One billion dollars. Then Detroit was like, 'Hey, can we go to war with Russia?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because of Russia's actions in Ukraine?President Obama is threatening them with economic sanctions. That's the latest. Yeah.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Referring to President Obama's interview with comedian Zach Galifianakis] &quot;No one has signed up for Obamacare, give or take 4.2 million people, and our President has gotten so desperate that he appeared on this website 'Funny or Die'. By the way, funny or die is also the ultimatum you get from Obama's death panel. Now, this show he went on, 'Between Two Ferns,' it went viral, which is all part of Obama's sinister plan - spread a virus, then watch everyone scramble for signing up for healthcare.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, by going on that Web show, Barack Obama undermined the authority of the presidency, and that is Fox News' job.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, President Obama and Joe Biden met with the Ukrainian prime minister to show their support for his government. That's nice.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seth Meyers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some bad news today for the President. It looks like Obamacare will miss its enrollment target of seven million people by March 31st, as only four million?have signed up so far.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Referring to President Obama's executive order on overtime pay] &quot;Emperor Obama is issuing an executive order bypassing Congress because they wouldn't pass new overtime rules. Why should they? They never work overtime - or time, for that matter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Referring to President Obama's executive order on overtime pay] &quot;And I don't know why he's doing it. There is no reason on God's green Earth to do it because the system works. Currently, you can spend 95 percent of the time sweeping floors and stock shelves, but if you're responsible for supervising people five percent of the time, you can then be considered an executive and be exempt from overtime pay. Folks, that makes sense to me. Even when you're stocking shelves you're managing a lot of people: Little Debbie, Chef Boyardee, the doughboy. This is nothing but forced income redistribution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Biden said that Russia's recent actions in the Ukraine have left it alone and naked in front of the rest of the world. Incidentally, alone and naked is also Putin's preferred style of hunting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Obama is taking a lot of heat now for how he's dealt with the situation. This week, Mitt Romney said the situation in Ukraine is a result of President Obama's bad timing. When he heard that, President Obama was like, 'My what?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House revealed that more than five million people have now signed up for Obamacare. Yeah, thanks to the Administration's recent push, five million.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seth Meyers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The situation in Ukraine continues to develop. Vladimir Putin signed a treaty this morning that formally absorbs Crimea into the Russian Federation. So if you felt bad because you didn't know where Crimea was, don't worry, it's gone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seth Meyers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Things are heating up, though. Vice President Biden said today that the US is considering sending troops to the Baltic states bordering Russia. According to Biden, the Baltic states are the territories located just past Boardwalk and Park Place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seth Meyers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said today that the 2014 midterms will be a victory for Republicans thanks to Obamacare. Coincidentally, Reince Priebus sounds like something that might be covered under Obamacare.&quot;</SPAN></P>

There's a new poll that shows that Vladimir Putin's approval rating has actually gone up 10 percent since he's sent troops into Crimea.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems everybody is weighing in on the whole situation out there.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, let's look at the rest of Obama's bracket. He picked Florida, Arizona, Michigan State and Louisville to make the Final Four.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been a brutal winter here, a lot of crazy weather. Some say it's because of climate change.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can kind of tell Obama's lonely just by the tweets that he's been sending out. Like last night, he tweeted, 'Hey, Michelle Obama, having eight pancakes. You better stop me. Lol. #kindofwishyouwould. #realtalk. #lonelytalk.' Then, an hour later, he wrote, 'Laying on the floor in the Oval Office. Oval is a funny word. O-val. Oooo-val. #legalizeit.' ? Here's another tweet. 'Somebody should start a Tinder, but just for friends. #notkidding. #idswiperight.' That's a good idea actually. Then he tweeted, 'Just peed in all 35 bathrooms. #dehydrated.' Starting to get weird there. And then finally he wrote, 'Just texted Putin. You up?' #desperate. #bestfrenemies.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seth Meyers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of Obamacare, 'The New York Times' reported that the Obama Administration spends $17 million a month on advertising for Obamacare. 'I don't even get out of bed for less than 20 mil,' said Flo from Progressive.&quot;</SPAN></P>

It is not easy losing weight and since we've made a lot of fat jokes in the past, I thought it would only be fair to celebrate by making some Chris Christie thin jokes. Here we go.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And by the way, maybe even a bigger question is, why does the President even need Secret Service protection in the Netherlands? What is somebody going to do?

So, now the United States doesn't want to get involved. We're sick and tired of wars. We don't know what to do. Here's what they did. They tossed him out of the G-8 meetings.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Referring to President Obama's Brussels trip] &quot;That's where President Obama has been. He went to the G-8 meetings. And I said, 'What? He's filling in for Dennis Rodman? What happened there? Shouldn't he be at the G-8?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's get to some news here and talk about what people are talking about. Things are still very tense between the US and Russia over the situation in Ukraine. And get this, intelligence officials are now saying that they had a hard time predicting Russia's invasion, because Vladimir Putin doesn't own a cell phone or use the Internet. I guess he doesn't want to be tracked. But you can tell Putin doesn't spend much time online, because when he sends, 'lol,' he means, 'Look out, Latvia.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Putin apparently doesn't use the Internet because he is afraid of being tracked by foreign governments and 'cause any time he needs to know something, he can just ask Edward Snowden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, President Obama is still very concerned about what is happening in Ukraine and, during a speech today in Belgium, Obama called for a united front with Europe against Russia. Obama promised that if Russia invades another country, America will stand behind Europe - way, way, way behind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, Belgium wanted to give the US Embassy in Brussels a gift. They want to give a gift to commemorate Obama's visit. This is real. This is a gift. They decided on a life-size cookie of President Obama wearing a USA sweatshirt and holding a basketball. France gives us the Statue of Liberty. Belgium gives us that. It got even weirder when Biden spent a half hour talking to it. He's like, 'You seem quiet today. Everything all right?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seth Meyers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the Obama Administration has given Americans another month to sign up for Obamacare as long as they check a box on the website saying they tried to sign up before the original launch. It's expected to be answered as truthfully as boxes on websites that say, 'Yes, I am 18.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seth Meyers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is ridiculous. Yesterday, three Secret Service agents were sent home and suspended for drinking, after one of them was passed out in the hotel hallway. They should have known he was drunk that night when he said, 'I love you guys.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

You know, he wants to spend money on the infrastructure of the United States. So he was going around New York City showing people - well this needs fixing. For example, Port Authority needs fixing. Where the buses and the trains and everything - that needs fixing. Penn Station, same thing. That needs a little help over there. Also in big, big structural trouble, the Knicks.

Vladimir Putin has been out-masculating Barack Obama at every turn. It's like Obama is playing checkers, and Putin is also playing checkers, but is doing it shirtless while riding a horse.&quot;</SPAN></P>

And, of course, the worst part of every breakup is canceling the trip you had planned for six years from now. This is so awkward, because right now Russian and American astronauts are up there together. We're still living together in the same place.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Referring to Karl Rove's comments on Hillary Clinton] &quot;Nation, this is a serious scandal because Rove's conjecture is based on soiled facts. Hillary Clinton did go to the hospital after a concussion in 2012, and she later exhibited some very strange behavior in her Benghazi testimony. She had a mastery of the facts and an unshakable confidence, all while wearing those stupid glasses. I mean, they're like - these things are like orthopedic shoes for your face. You'd have to be brain damaged to wear those, or nearsighted, which I believe is caused by brain damage.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All Karl Rove is saying, is that Hillary is a public figure and we should be worried about her brain. Folks, there is another public figure who worries me even more - Karl Rove. Because he said that Hillary spent 30 days in the hospital when in fact she was there for only three days. Has Karl Rove lost track of time because he has a serious brain injury? I'm just asking the question. I mean, for some reason, he is protecting his skull with a thick cushion of meat.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Do we care if Hillary Clinton runs for president? I tried to look for little subtleties, little nuances. And I'm no political expert and no pundit or figure, but she has a new book out of her experiences as Secretary of State, and instead of a book jacket, you know when they put a book jacket on a book, hers is wearing a pantsuit. Hillary said, as she's giving away a little hint. She said her staff is now doing internal polling. I thought, 'Oh my God, no. That's what got her husband in trouble, come on, no. Please.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

But a new strategy has been pioneered by Arizona Republican Scott Fistler, seen here photobombing a picture of a map after losing two races in a heavily Hispanic community. He's found a way to get his name out there: Get another name out there.&quot; Reporter: &quot;Scott Fistler has legally changed his name to Cesar Chavez.&quot; Colbert: &quot;Adios, Scott Fistler. Hola, Cesar Chavez. You know what they say, if you can't beat 'em, pretend you joined 'em.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To be honest, I'm glad anyone is here tonight, because there's a big traffic jam right here in L.A. right now - bigger than usual because President Obama is in town. The President is in town to make everybody late for yoga lattes. ... He's here in L.A. to go to fundraisers, where he will spend the evening pretending to care about what celebrities think.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel like the President only comes to L.A. for money. He's like a college student who only comes home to do laundry and steal food from the refrigerator.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They shut down several major streets today for the President, and they're going to do it again tomorrow. A good way to ensure that your approval rating remains in the low 40s is to see to it that it takes everybody three-and-a half hours to get home from work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, if he's here for donations, he should just park his motorcade on the 405 and refuse to move until we all chip in to give five million dollars, right?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know Hillary Clinton - they think she's going to run for president. ? Well, a college roommate of Hillary said that she really loves smoking that weed. That they could not keep enough weed around, and don't make the mistake of getting yourself between some weed and Hillary Clinton, because you just get trampled. Weed, weed, weed. So now?maybe she'll be President of the United States, and how about that White House vegetable garden now, ladies and gentlemen?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, as I hope you know, America continues to face a border crisis, with thousands of undocumented Central American children pouring over our southern border, and President Obama still rejects my plan to build a kid-apult. The kids will love it. It's got to be safer than those chain things.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And folks, it is only going to get worse, with over 52,000 children in Federal custody and as many 90,000 expected by the end of the year. That is a flood. It's like El Ni?o is raining actual ni?os.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, a judge said that Obamacare is an acceptable substitute for state-run health insurance. ... He actually said that, 'It's just like Domino's being a good substitute for Pizza Hut.' But then Americans said, 'Well, either way, it's taken you guys way longer than 30 minutes to deliver it, so give us our free healthcare.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a new interview with NPR, Republican Senator Marco Rubio said that Hillary Clinton is not a candidate for the 21st century. Then he continued his interview on the radio.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seth Meyers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Marco Rubio told reporters Hillary Clinton is out of touch with voters and said that she is a 20th-century candidate. That's ridiculous. Hillary started campaigning way before the 20th century.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seth Meyers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Despite the recent unrest in the Middle East, President Obama's approval rating has stayed constant at 42 percent. Wow. He can't even get that to change.&quot;</SPAN></P>

In the midst of her 2008 campaign, she took time to help out a struggling senior with severely impaired judgment. And this week, in her continuing quest to remind America of her existence, Palin announced a new project. ? Yes, the all-Sarah Palin channel!

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Referring to Forbes' coolest-city list] &quot;You know what city 'Forbes' says is the coolest? The number one coolest city in America is Washington, DC. How did that happen? Did Obama start smoking again?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Forbes' bases its rankings on factors like how many entertainment options a city has, parks, sporting events. Somehow Washington, DC, came out on top. That makes sense. I mean, between Joe Biden and John Boehner alone, it's like a nonstop Burning Man festival over there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some good news for NSA leaker Edward Snowden. Russia just announced that he can stay in their country for three more years. And Snowden was like, 'Old news, bro. I leaked that...yesterday.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Russian government said Edward Snowden can stay for three more years. So, three more years in Russia, or as Obama put it, 'Eh, that was going to be his prison sentence, anyway. So, it doesn't matter to me.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seth Meyers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, today Michelle Obama told the US-Africa leaders' summit that women are smarter than men. And I'm like, 'Nice try, Michelle. It's women is smarter than men.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last week the White House was briefly locked down after a toddler squeezed through the fence on the North Lawn. And this is really cute. This is real. The actual statement from the Secret Service. ... They said, 'We were going to wait until he learned to talk to question him. But in lieu of that, he got a time-out and was sent on his way with his parents.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a new interview, Hillary Clinton criticized President Obama, who's been using the phrase 'Don't do stupid stuff' to describe his foreign policy doctrine. She said the phrase lacks depth. But in the White House's defense, it's a much better slogan than the other one that they were considering...'Bad things, they're not good, so don't do 'em.' Wait, what?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seth Meyers:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I saw that President Obama went to the beach yesterday while he's vacationing on Martha's Vineyard. Which got weird when he took out his metal detector to search for $16 trillion in quarters.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people are upset that President Obama went to the beach yesterday with everything that's going on in the world. You know times are tough for Obama, because even the sharks were like, 'I'm not going near that guy.' I mean, it's just bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Also, during a fundraiser last night, President Obama suggested that one or more Supreme Court justices may retire soon. Which got awkward when Ruth Bader Ginsburg said, 'You can have this gavel when you pry it out of my even colder, deader fingers.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And finally, we have 'Personal Motto.' Hillary's is, '2016 can't get here fast enough.' Obama's is, 'Ditto.' So, I guess that maybe they're not that different after all.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's actually been a little tension between President Obama and Hillary Clinton this week. In fact, Hillary called Obama yesterday to say that she wasn't trying to attack him when she called his foreign policy too weak. And then she was like, 'Like you were going to do anything about it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary also told the President that she was looking forward to hugging it out the next time they saw each other. So, you know it's going to be one of those awkward shoulders in, butt out hugs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rick Perry is fueling speculation that he'll run in 2016 by visiting the Iowa State Fair. Unfortunately, he hurt his chances by holding a two-hour conversation with that butter sculpture of Kevin Costner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seth Meyers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Fox News' medical expert, Dr. Keith Ablow, told viewers that Michelle Obama needs 'to drop a few.' So I think there's a good chance Michelle Obama is going to drop Dr. Keith Ablow.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After attacking President Obama's foreign policy, Hillary Clinton now says she wants to hug it out. When he heard this, Bill Clinton told the President, 'Take it from me. You're not going to get any more than that.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

And he's gotten a lot of criticism for that. And now, Obama is facing criticism for coming back to work for a couple days, because they say it wastes taxpayer money. Or as Obama put it, '28 more months, two weeks, four days and 16 hours. Get through this. We can't win. Just get through this.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House says that Obama won't make any major announcements during his trip back to DC., but the White House did say that Obama would be making some minor announcements, like, 'Just mixed a bowl of Fruity Pebbles with Cocoa Pebbles, 'cause I'm the President and I can do whatever I want.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seth Meyers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama's approval rating this week reached an all-time low. An all-time low. Apparently, it's all the way down to 'some of the people, some of the time.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone's talking about a possible feud between President Obama and Hillary Clinton. ?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know the governor of Texas, Rick Perry? Remember Rick Perry in the last presidential race? Good looking guy. Well, he's been arrested, fingerprinted and they took his mug shot, handcuffed him. He's being indicted, and he's governor.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, back in the US, it seems like everybody is upset with President Obama. He's got a lot to deal with right now and everyone's piling it on. Just recently, Congressman Paul Ryan claimed that Americans are having buyer's remorse about President Obama. I think they might be right, because today I saw Obama just standing next to an ice cream maker and a Bowflex.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a new interview, Paul Ryan gave a big endorsement to the idea of Mitt Romney running for president in 2016, saying that he'd even drive Romney's campaign bus. He said, 'I'll drive the bus.' But then, this also caught people's eye. Ryan wrote on his Facebook page, 'The Packers are looking so good, I'd drive their bus.' And we know that he's a Packers fan. But then he posted on the Partridge Family's page, and said, 'Hey, Partridge Family, are you guys still a thing? If you're not, I guess that bus ain't being used. Let me take it for a spin.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama is a complete failure. If he is so committed to fighting terror, why am I seeing pop-up stores [referring to Halloween costume stores] filled with things that scare me. When it comes to national security, when it comes to national security, this guy's worse than Jimmy Carter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new survey found that more than half of Americans see President Obama's time in office as a failure. While the rest said, 'You saw him in his office? When?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was in his office yesterday. In fact, President Obama met with the temporary Secret Service director in the Oval Office to talk about all the recent White House security breaches. Of course, first they had to address the elephant in the room. Not metaphorically - there was an actual elephant wandered into the White House. Security is just awful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess it's all getting to him now, because during a fundraiser yesterday, President Obama said he understands feeling like, quote, 'The world is spinning so fast, and nobody is able to control it.' Then scientists said, 'Well that's probably because the world is spinning fast and you can't control it.' That's a fact.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some more political news - a new study estimates that only 3.4 percent of Americans will vote in the mid-term elections next month. But on the bright side, 100 percent will still complain about the results.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seth Meyers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More bad news for the President. President Obama's latest approval rating is just 43 percent. But not everyone hates him. A lot of people are breaking into the White House just to try and meet him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seth Meyers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney is back in the news. He's back in the news. When asked about a possible 2016 presidential run by Mitt Romney, John McCain said everybody in the Republican Party likes Mitt Romney. And then he slammed his locker and went to gym class.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seth Meyers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is pretty cool. Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg was knighted by Queen Elizabeth this week. He was knighted. So from now on, you'll refer to him respectfully as Sir Little Boy Soda Stealer.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're getting ready for Halloween down there at the White House. They have a big pumpkin carving and, you know, the cool thing about it, the pumpkins they're carving came out of Michelle Obama's vegetable garden. She raised pumpkins they're using for the jack-o'-lanterns, and the knife that they use to carve came from a guy who hopped over the fence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Referring to the &quot;Republicans Are People, Too&quot; TV ad campaign] &quot;Nation, it seems like every time you turn on the news lately, you hear something that shocks you to your core. Just this morning, I was horrified to find out there is an election next month. And this midterm season, the best political ad does not promote a candidate. It promotes a demonized minority [Republicans]. Yes, Republicans are people, too. I have not seen such courageous rebranding since White Castle's 'It is food.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A big story out of Washington. They just announced that the budget deficit has shrunk to only $486 billion, which is its lowest point since President Obama took office. Obama was like, 'Well, I guess we'll just have to work harder and - wait, is that good news?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of the President, today, he gave a speech in California to motivate young voters by discussing his commitments to new technology. Ironically, nobody heard him 'cause they were all staring at their phones.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Midterm elections are right around the corner and politicians are doing everything they can to get people to vote. In fact, during a speech yesterday, first lady Michelle Obama went so far as to say voting can actually be a fun thing to do on a first date. Yeah. Really, what better way to make a first date go smoothly than bringing up politics right off the bat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, a new study estimates that only 3.4 percent of all Americans will vote in the midterm elections next month. Three percent, yeah. Because of that, both parties have started campaigns with entirely new slogans to encourage people to get out to vote. But I'm not sure that they're very successful. Take a look. Here's the first one. 'You know that thing you do to choose the person who wins 'Dancing with the Stars?' Try that with politicians.' That seems lazy. Here's another one here. 'If you don't vote, you can't complain. Well, actually you can. But it's better if you vote. You're not gonna vote, are you?' Seems like a downer. And finally there's - 'Voting! It's how average citizens fool themselves into thinking they're in charge!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some more political news this week. A spokesman for Harry Reid said even though Joe Biden makes a lot of mistakes, he's still able to connect and tells us what's on his mind. It's sounds less like he's talking about the Vice President and more like a chimpanzee that knows sign language.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seth Meyers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kim Jong-un has been out of the public eye and North Korean officials say that it's because he needs a total of 100 days to recover from his foot ailments. When asked what kind of foot ailments, they said liposuction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seth Meyers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, President Obama criticized the Republican Party for being a party of billionaires, while speaking at the $26 million Connecticut home of a man named Rich Richmond. Although - to be fair - in Connecticut, a $26 million home is considered the projects.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama was in California over the weekend to attend a fundraiser hosted by the creator of Farmville. Obama and the creator of Farmville have a lot in common because they both really wish it was still 2009. It was a great year for both.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I also saw that President Obama played his 200th round of golf yesterday. Democrats are like, 'You know what? He can do whatever he wants as long as he's not trying to campaign for us.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new poll found that 58 percent of millenials - that's the people who grew up in the '90s - they would vote for Hillary Clinton if she ran for president. That's what they're saying. Yeah, she's a shoo-in with millennials, unless Urkel decides to run.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seth Meyers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un, last week...missed a ceremony marking the 69th anniversary of the country. Experts say it's especially strange because he knew cake would be there.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain said this weekend that there needs to be some sort of czar to deal with the Ebola outbreak. An Ebola czar. So it turns out there's something you can put on your resume that's even worse than sandwich artist.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, remember everyone was worried, where is that guy? He's been hiding out. He made his first public appearance yesterday in over 40 days. But since he saw his shadow, now that means 60 more years of nuclear winter.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A recent study revealed that the reading level of presidential speeches has dropped significantly over the past 200 years. Or as Americans put it, 'Why dat?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seth Meyers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un resurfaced yesterday after more than a month out of the public eye. US officials think that the reason no one saw him for so long is that he was starring in an NBC sitcom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seth Meyers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apparently, North Korea released new video of Kim Jong-un walking with a cane. Walking with a cane. Recluse. Loves chocolate. He's like the Willy Wonka of dictators if you think about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, the Obama Administration announced the 140 people selected from across the country to participate in the fall White House internship program. And unlike the White House, the internship program is very hard to get into.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. My inbox would be so full if we had the Internet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. One minute I'm eating soup with Dr. Nancy Snyderman. Next minute I'm in quarantine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. I could have spent another year in Branson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Guess who caught the bouquet at Clooney's wedding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Is Letterman dead?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Long story short, 'The View' went with a different co-host.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Referring to the Obama Administration's plan to upgrade nuclear weapons, plants, labs and delivery systems.] &quot;First up folks, I was outraged when the President won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009 for, quote, 'His vision of and work for a world free from nuclear weapons.' But it's five years later and he's been unable to disarm one of the largest nuclear powers in the world - him. Sorry, liberals, turns out President Kumbaya is actually President Boom-ba-yah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Referring to the Obama Administration's reason for nuclear weapons upgrade plan.] &quot;That's right, instead of decommissioning our nukes, we're saving them to shoot down asteroids. That is the exact same reason we haven't decommissioned Bruce Willis. Don't tell the Russians, we swore we would get rid of him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday in South Carolina, [Vice President] Biden met with a group of African-American ministers and referred to himself as, quote, 'The only white boy on the east side of Wilmington,' which explains his new nickname, 'Vanilla Vice.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Biden told a group of African-American ministers he's 'the only white boy on the east side of Wilmington.' Yeah, which got worse when he was like, 'Relax, relax, half of my best friend is black.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I saw that today President Obama held a video conference with the leaders of four European countries to discuss the Ebola crisis. And I guess even the President is freaked out about Ebola, because the video conference was just from the next room. He was like, 'You got to stay in there, put on a hazmat suit. Did someone sneeze? I heard someone sneeze.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This does not sound encouraging. During a recent interview, Sen. John McCain declared the US isn't winning the war against ISIS. Even ISIS was like, 'Well, not with that attitude.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Chris Christie, our buddy?his approval rating in New Jersey has hit its lowest level in three years. Voters saying he hasn't done enough to fix the state's economy. Christie says that's really unfair. He's like, 'I'm only two men.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Chris Christie now has a negative approval rating in New Jersey. In fact, here are the latest poll results of popular things in New Jersey. 98 percent, there's Bruce Springsteen. 76 percent, things that fall off trucks. A bit lower, 55 percent is knowing a guy who knows a guy. And then there's Chris Christie at 48 percent. You see, that's what's popular there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
