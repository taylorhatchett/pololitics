<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to the Tonight Show. Nice to have you all here. I guess this is like Holy Week, isn't it? Well, it is. We had Palm Sunday. It's also Passover. This week is also Easter. You know, between the rescue of our POWs and the Tigers winning a game, this is truly the week of miracles, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Boy, I had a good day today. Listen to this. I bought four chairs and a table on Ebay from some guy in Baghdad, 12 bucks, 12 bucks.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, President Bush announced that all this time he's been mispronouncing the word Iraq. He says it's actually pronounced 'Syria.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, this is getting scary now. And, you know, the press keeps asking President Bush, 'When is the war going to end? When will this war end?' See, I think this war will end officially the day after the 2004 elections. Because if President Bush learned anything from his father, it's don't end a war too soon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the leaders of France, Russia and Germany, as I call them, our Axis of Envy, they've gathered for a summit on what their part, what their role will be in the rebuilding of Iraq. You know, I think France should participate in rebuilding Iraq, I do. I mean, think about it, when it comes to having experience about what do after losing a war, nobody does it better than them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's something that came as quite a shock, the Canadian prime minister has ordered the Canadian navy not to capture any of Saddam Hussein's henchmen if they try to flee Iraq by sea. Today at the Pentagon, they were stunned. They had no idea Canada had a navy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said this week, that Slovakia has already offered their help in de-mining Iraq. They want to help de-mine Iraq. And listen to this. Exxon Mobil has offered their help in de-oiling Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's something a little frightening. CNN reports that when they broke into Uday Hussein's palace, you hear about this? They found pornography, Cuban cigars and pictures of President Bush's twin daughters. I'm sorry, that was Bill Clinton's bunker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess Marines found a bunch of these suicide vests placed neatly on hangers and covered in plastic. Did you hear about this? Army intelligence says they found them just in time, 'cause in another week the suicide jacket and pants would have been ready.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, that's why guys wear suicide vests. In a suicide vest, if something goes wrong, yeah, you still die. See, suicide pants, something goes wrong, you just wish you were dead.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our commanders in the Gulf are warning that Iraq is still a very, very dangerous place. Not as dangerous as riding shotgun with Snoop Dogg, but still pretty dangerous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A number of people in the White House now are concerned that Michael Moore, you remember Michael - he said all that stuff at the Academy Awards -- there you go. Huge hand. Yeah. Well, they're worried that Michael Moore might be invited to the annual White House correspondents dinner in which President Bush will speak. They're not worried Moore will try to disrupt the evening, you know, they just don't want to get stuck behind him in the buffet line.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Officials at the baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York, have canceled the celebration of the 15th anniversary of the baseball movie 'Bull Durham,' you hear about this? Because Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins have these anti-war, anti-Bush views. Canceled at the Hall of Fame. And even worse news for Pete Rose. Turns out, he bet on Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tim Robbins sent a letter saying he did not realize baseball was a Republican sport. You think it's Republican or Democratic? What do you think? Well, it's got a lot of multimillionaires, so it could be Republican. But then you got a lot of switch hitters who grab themselves, so it could be Democratic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They've gone crazy over there in Iraq, they're just looting like crazy. It's unbelievable. I haven't seen so much merchandise flying out of stores since, well, Winona Ryder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday in downtown Baghdad, they toppled the statue of Sean Penn.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't care what they say about weapons of mass destruction or not, but Iraq is just a horrible place. Just listen to what our troops he found over there -- torture chambers, nerve gas, all-male country clubs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the US military has vowed to get Saddam Hussein. In fact, they're going to do it tomorrow night when he goes out to mail his taxes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And now, President Bush is saying Syria, Syria has weapons of mass destruction. Gee, I wonder where he's heading with this?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to the Tonight Show. What a crowd! All right. Yeah! You sound like you all think you're getting refunds or something. Man!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, today was tax day. Of course, the one day when every American wishes he was an illegal alien.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, actually, technically, people talk about this. They debate this. But technically, you're not paying taxes. According to the Bush Administration, your bank account is being liberated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the day Americans have to deal with their two favorite government agencies -- the IRS and the Post Office. You know what I do to make it a full day? I just drop by the Department of Motor Vehicles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody here afraid of being audited? Oh, people worry about this, but according to statistics, listen to this, you are five times more likely to get murdered, to get murdered, than face criminal prosecution for tax evasion. Isn't that amazing? Here's the ironic thing, if you did get murdered it would probably be by some criminal who doesn't pay taxes in the first place. He's got time to murder you because he's not home doing his taxes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, folks, with 90% of the bombs in, MSNBC now calling the war for the US. Looks like it's over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's see what's happening in Iraq. Or as the Pentagon calls it, gateway to Syria!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For the first time ever, the people of Iraq are united. Tell you what I'm talking about -- today on CNN I saw a Kurd, a Shiite and a member of the Republican Guard all working together to cart off a big-screen TV.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whoever's put in charge of rebuilding Iraq, here's what they should do. Put all the furniture into the rooms first, then make the doorways smaller than the average house. This way, next time the looters won't be able to get the stuff out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, did you hear about what they found in Uday's house? You know, Saddam Hussein's son? Did you hear about this? Besides indoor pools and his own zoo and tons of pornography, they also discovered Uday had his own brothel. He had a whorehouse built into his house. This is what happens when single guys decorate their own place. They go overboard!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, for the first weeks of the war, the ratings at the cable news networks were huge, huge, way, way up, but they've fallen the past couple of weeks. You know why? Most of their early viewers were Iraqi soldiers tuning in to find out from Geraldo where our Marines were.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you heard, last night another suicide driver was stopped and taken into custody. Rodney King! Rodney King! Back in the news again. Oh, good old Rodney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, here's something I don't understand. The Utah Supreme Court ruled this week an atheist has the right to pray at government- sponsored public functions. Who is the atheist praying to?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That shows you how screwed up our government is. The only people allowed to pray in public on government land are atheists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as you know, Hillary Clinton has a new book coming out. They can't get the title. Hillary has this book, supposed to be due in August. And they keep coming up with different titles to see which ones the public likes -- I guess this is the latest one. Okay, this is by Hillary Clinton: &quot;Honey, I'm sorry I'm not Fat Enough.' Okay, they probably won't go with that one then!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, what a nasty audience we had. Rough crowd. Right after the show, they toppled my statue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They found one of Saddam Hussein's family palaces. ... The family palace, this is what the US troops found - a private zoo, Prozac, pictures of naked women. It was just like Michael Jackson's place, except for the naked women.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The troops did not find any nerve gas. However, they did find large drums of Aqua Velva.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They found tequila, Viagra, and Prozac. And coincidentally, that's how I got through the shingles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Iraqis need to be taught how to behave. For example, you can't just go out rioting and looting. You can't do that, you know. Unless your team wins a championship. Then everything is fine.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the latest poll, just out today, 71% of the American people approve of President Bush. Well, Bush is very, very happy. Well, of course he's happy. It only took 49% of the vote to win the election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, now that the war in Iraq is over, a lot of people want President Bush to focus on the economy. You know who really wants Bush to focus on the economy? Syria. Yeah, Syria.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people are afraid they're going to go to war with Syria. Syria is not Iraq, okay? It is less dangerous. It's less of an enemy. It has less of an army. And it has less oil.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;American officials have accused Syria of possessing chemical weapons. And today, Hans Blix, the UN inspector, he offered to spend the next three months not finding any of their chemical weapons, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Iraqis sat down for talks on how to put together a postwar government. They would have sat down yesterday, but somebody stole all the couches.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now there are reports from Baghdad that officials are taking bribes for favors, they're giving jobs to their relatives, they're taking money under the table from contractors. Do you know what that means? This war is less than a week old, already they have an American-style democracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I guess you know all of Iraq's oil fields are now under US control, which is kind of ironic since all the gas stations here are run by Middle Easterners.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;French President Jacques Chirac called President Bush yesterday for the first time in two months in an attempt to try to warm relations. He wants to find a French role in the construction of Iraq. He wants something the French can do. See, now you know why France used to be called 'Gaul.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today the homeland security code was lowered. It was lowered, except here in Los Angeles, where it was raised to code red. Nothing to do with Middle East. Just Rodney King out driving again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, here you go, Monica Lewinsky hosting a reality show for Fox beginning next week. You know about this show? Show's called 'Mr. Personality,' where a woman will try to choose between 20 men who all have masks on. And Monica Lewinsky will offer her dating advice. Well, who better to offer advice on choosing a guy without seeing his face than Monica Lewinsky?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On my lunch hour, I'm walking through Central Park, and I saw a beautiful spring sight here in New York City. It was a robin, like one of the first robins of spring, building a nest out of duct tape.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're learning more and more about Saddam Hussein and his family than we did before the war. And US troop have busted into many of the family palaces. Listen to what they found. They break into one of the family palaces, here's what they find. Tequila. Hell, I got tequila. Tequila. Viagra. And Prozac. Or as I call it, a pre-show cocktail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can tell that the war is nearly over. Tonight on ABC they have a two-hour special, Dick Clark's Rocking Downfall of Baghdad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even though Iraq has been liberated now, we have to teach them about democracy and the voting, the election process. Because there's still some confusion about democracy and the election process -- oh, no, wait a minute, that's Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's interesting, I was looking at my calendar and this year we have a late Passover. We also have a late Easter. And a late Saddam Hussein.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, how about this? President Bush went on TV to announce that from now on, every three weeks, we're gonna kick another country's ass. Yeah! Every three weeks, yeah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And more good news today -- Iraq announced they will stay open during the remodeling. So that's good news, too.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Pentagon officials said today that our military did not use the majority of the ammunition we brought to Iraq. We still have ammunition left over, which is not good news for Syria.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, if you don't know this, Syria is an ancient Arabic word for 'next.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, US forces in Iraq captured one of Saddam's half-brothers. Barzan, I think that guy's name is. Barzan. These people sound like something from 'The Jungle Book.' Barzan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, I guess Barzan was one of Saddam's top military advisers. You can imagine how bad he would have gotten his ass kicked if he didn't have these advisers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what I noticed? How we never seem to go to war with countries you want to visit? No, we never liberate Aruba or Tahiti.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;US forces did a terrific job in capturing that terrorist mastermind, Abu Abbas. You remember the Achille Lauro hijacking? They killed that poor person, like 16 years ago. Now we have to decide what to do with him. I mean, the family of the man he killed, they want him sent here. The Italians want to extradite him to Italy. The Palestinians want him sent to Palestine. You know what would make everybody happy? Let's send a piece of him to each place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was in Iraq. Sources say Abbas never made any attempt to hide himself. He lived a normal life. He was out in the open, in a country that protected him from the US. It's the same deal Roman Polanski has with France, basically. Oh, yeah. I'm way off base. Shut up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Under a new Bush Administration proposal, DNA profiles of people who have been arrested will be added to the FBI's database. And some of President Bush's advisers told him, 'That sounds like Big Brother.' Bush was furious. He told him, 'Hey, I don't have any big brothers -- I'm the oldest.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this week, in 1961, was the famous Bay of Pigs invasion. See, a lot of the young people today don't remember the Bay of Pigs. They think it's some bad reality show on Fox. 'If you loved the girls on &quot;Temptation Island,&quot; you'll love 'Bay of Pigs.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And another Saddam Hussein statue came tumbling down today. Rodney King hit it with his car.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a poll in the LA Times, Governor Gray Davis is the least popular Governor in 55 years. And here's the sad part, they've only been doing this poll for 12 years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the New York Post reporting that Bill Clinton is in Chappaqua, New York, writing his memoirs, and Hillary Clinton is in Washington writing hers.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, kind of an embarrassing moment at this year's Easter egg hunt on the White House lawn. Did you see this? Of all the people invited, Hans Blix was the only one who couldn't find a single egg.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hans Blix said today he wants to go back to Iraq. He wants to go back. Apparently, he needs a couch and a big screen TV.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now the government is saying that the Iraqi weapons of mass destruction may have been taken to other countries. I say this to those countries, 'If you happen to have a lot of oil, you're in big trouble!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The press is reporting that a lot of Syrians, a lot of Syrians came across the border to fight Americans in Iraq, which is kind of stupid. If they want to fight Americans, all you do is stay home and wait a week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The latest reports from Iraq say the Iraqi Minister of Information is dead. ... He's apparently choked on his own words.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're looting everything in Baghdad. They're just stealing everything. People even taking animals from the Baghdad Zoo. ... But interesting, the looters took every animal but they wanted nothing to do with the lions and tigers. So, they're like sports fans in Detroit, apparently.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I was so busy over the weekend with all the Easter festivities I totally forgot who are we at war with today? Is it North Korea yet?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, they're now saying it will be at least five years before Iraq has a functioning, working government that can deliver even basic services. So, really, it's no different than Sacramento.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And over the weekend, tens of thousands of Islamic militants marched in the streets of Baghdad chanting, 'America is God's enemy. Death to America.' Nice to see things are back to normal over there.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Aren't these the same people who just a couple of days ago walked around with stolen couches on their heads? So, apparently, there's nothing left to steal, so back to business as usual.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, I'll give you an idea of how bad the looting has gotten. They even looted the Baghdad zoo. You probably saw this. They took monkeys and bears, horses, birds. Here's my question? How do you steal a bear?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's say you stole the bear. You even get the bear back to your house. Now what do you do? 'Ahmed, put him in the spare bedroom, you idiot.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;American forces in Iraq found $650 million in cash, in cash, in bills. $650 million hidden in a sealed-up cottage. See, this is why Bush wants to invade Iraq. The entire country is like money and oil. It's like Republican Disneyland over there. Just cash and oil.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They also arrested yet another Hussein half-brother. What's up with the half brothers? When they get caught they could be quarter-brothers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is like, what, the third half-brother? How many half-brothers? What, was Hussein's father in the NBA? How many kids does he have?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, more and more details coming out about Saddam Hussein, or as they call him now, Barney Rubble.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And about his decadent lifestyle. Very decadent lifestyle. Apparently, every one of his palaces contains a huge collection of pornography, or as he called it, weapons of masturbation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, it was announced today that on May 29th, President Bush is going to host his 35th class reunion from Yale. Graduated from Yale, he's going to hold his class reunion at the White House. Boy, that is every 'C' student's dream come true, isn't it? Go back to your class reunion as the President.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Starting this week, 44 commercial airline pilots have passed a law enforcement training course in Georgia that makes them eligible to carry handguns on flights. Two of the pilots didn't complete the course because they weren't able to pass the psychological exam. They couldn't pass the psychological exam. So all they're qualified to do now is fly a plane with people on it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, let me tell you, this gun training class is pretty rigorous. In order to be certified they have to be able to shoot ten of those little tiny liquor bottles off of a fence in a row.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the New York Post, Hillary Clinton is having problems. She's supposed to write that book. And she says the problem she's having with writing her memoirs is she doesn't want to write about Monica Lewinsky, Paula Jones or Jennifer Flowers. Well, of course she doesn't. Those are Bill's memoirs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier tonight was a premiere of Monica Lewinsky's new reality show, 'Mr. Personality.' It's a show where a woman picks a guy without ever seeing his face. In this case, the guys' faces are hidden by a mask. See, in Monica's case, the guy's face was hidden by a desk. But it's a little different.&quot;</SPAN></P>

I'm sorry, I was watching the local news.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;Speaking of celebrities, according to The Arab Times, which, you know, I get every day. Posters of Harrison Ford, Sharon Stone and George Michael were found in the headquarters of Saddam Hussein's secret police.  The Sharon Stone and the Harrison Ford pictures were in the main lobby and the George Michael one was in the men's room.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;Here's a surprise -- Syria has pledged to help rebuild Iraq.  But President Bush told them, 'You know, it might be wise of them to save their money.  They might need their own rebuilding project later on.'&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;And the man we put in charge of Iraq, Jay Garner, wasn't he on 'The Rockford Files?'&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;Anyway, he will have the electric power back up in Iraq and he said it will be done as quickly and as cheaply as possible.  I'm not sure who's helping him in this deal, but I'm pretty sure it's not Governor Gray Davis.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;Four American soldiers have been arrested in Iraq for trying to steal a million dollars.  You see this on the news?  They found it in Baghdad, they stole a million bucks.  And I guess their commanding officer got suspicious when these guys pulled up in their Bradley fighting vehicle and they had a chauffeur.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Do you think the soldiers should get to keep the money?  You know, if they have to give back the money they found, I think Exxon should have to give back all the oil they found.  Try to even it out a little bit.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;In San Francisco over the weekend, peace activists got naked and spelled out the words, 'Make love, not war.' And you know who was really impressive, the naked guy who did the capital 'E.'&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;Hey, I want to wish our best to Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.  Alan Greenspan is going to have surgery on his enlarged prostate.  Doctors said they're gonna reduce it by one quarter of a percentage point.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;Here's another sign the economy is not doing well.  Plastic surgery, down 12% this year. 12% fewer people are getting plastic surgeries.  See, that's what they mean when they say the economy could turn ugly.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;At a town meeting in Utah, Senator Orrin Hatch told anti-polygamy activists that he knows polygamists, he knows polygamists that live there and they are fine, fine people.  You got to understand why he wouldn't want to offend polygamists.  That's what, 15, 20 votes per house?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It has been chilly. You know, last night I went to the big Earth Day rally. You know it was Earth Day yesterday. Yeah. It was so cold, I had to sit in my Humvee with the engine running just to keep warm.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see those Iraqis making that pilgrimage? Slashing their foreheads with knives, whipping their backs with chains? It's unbelievable. See, when Saddam Hussein was around, they weren't allowed to make that pilgrimage. See, if they tried that with Saddam Hussein, he would have cut their foreheads with knives and whipped them with chains.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is unbelievable, our troops discovered $112 million in cash, hidden in a dog kennel in Baghdad. That's true. It was also reported yesterday, Saddam Hussein executed all his financial advisers. Well, duh. If your best investment is to put your money in a dog kennel, I would have killed them, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was more looting in Iraq today. And that's just by Fox News.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A TV engineer for the Fox News Channel has been charged with trying to smuggle stolen Iraqi paintings into the US. See, no wonder they got so much good video of the people looting. They were right there with them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just hope when he goes to court, his jury is as fair and balanced as Fox News.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At an airport back east, the FBI spotted a couple of ancient artifacts they thought were taken from the Baghdad museum. Turns out, just Dan Rather and Ted Koppel coming home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Looks like Senator Rick Santorum is in a lot of trouble. You hear of this guy? He's not making his appearance on 'Will &amp; Grace.' Yeah, it's not gonna happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is his quote, 'I have no problem with homosexuals. I have a problem with homosexual acts.' Well, maybe he's doing them wrong. Try a little KY or something. I don't know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gay rights groups are calling for Santorum's resignation because he compared homosexuality to bigamy, polygamy, adultery and incest. It's not just the gay rights groups that are insulted. Well, the Mormons are insulted because he included polygamy. Congress was insulted because he included adultery. And Arkansas was insulted because he included incest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, folks, it happened again. In Grand Rapids, Michigan, an American Eagle pilot...was caught getting on a plane drunk. Another pilot caught drunk. Oh, and did you hear his explanation today? He said this is his first flight carrying a gun, so he wanted to work up some courage in case he had to shoot somebody.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the tabloids, I don't know how true this is, they say former President Bill Clinton is going deaf. Really? See all the women he dated? I thought he was going blind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the tabloids, they say Clinton wears little hearing aids in both ears. Hearing aids in both ears. In fact, you know what Clinton says he misses hearing the most? Hillary coming upstairs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Iraq, four Americans soldiers have been arrested and charged with stealing $1 million cash. And after hearing about this, the Fox Network announced plans for a new reality show called, 'GI Joe Millionaire.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll tell you something, you know what the commanding officer said to them when they got caught with that money? They said, 'All right, drop and give me 20. All right, give a 50. Now, give me a 20.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me tell you something, if you're going to steal millions of dollars in a military operation, first you have to become a defense contractor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The UN weapons inspectors said today they want to go back into Iraq, and now that the fighting is over, so do the French. Yes. So that worked out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our soldiers in Iraq have found another 600 suicide vests. They found 600 more of these suicide vests. That seems like a lot of suicide vests to be left over. What I think happened here, see, when the Marines started getting close, I think the Iraqi commander said, 'All right, men, put on your suicide vests.' And once the Iraqis saw the Marines, they said, 'You know, Sarge, mine's a little tight.&quot;No, mine doesn't fit either.&quot;I'm going to wait for the new batch to come in.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it's now being reported that Saddam Hussein executed all of his economic advisers. Executed them all, killed all of his economic advisers. And today Bush said, 'You can do that?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The guy they captured today, Tariq Aziz, had a Barry Manilow album in his house, which proves there is no limit to the torture these people were willing to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And White House aides say that President Bush is already working on a speech declaring an end to the war in Iraq. His speechwriters are just searching for a diplomatic way to say, you know, 'We kicked ass,' basically.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush praised Syria today for cooperating with the US. I think that video that the President sent Syria helped. Do you happen to have a copy of it? He showed this to the people of Syria and I think it helped bring them around. It's called, 'Iraqi war bombing highlights.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And did you see that religious ceremony where those Iraqis were hitting themselves with the whips there and beating themselves, crawling on their knees, begging for forgiveness. No, I'm sorry. That was the Dixie Chicks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight on ABC, Natalie Maines told Diane Sawyer she made a poor choice of words, that's what she said. She made a poor choice of words. What happened was her choice of words are making her poor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said he would willing to serve another term. Yeah, Greenspan went on to say, 'Where else would I find a job in this economy?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A conservative group is asking Americans to boycott all companies who advertise on Monica Lewinsky's new reality show. The conservative group is made up of several right-wing Republicans and one female Democratic Senator.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said today in an interview, he has strong evidence Saddam Hussein is either dead or seriously wounded. I'm sorry -- that is what he said about the Lakers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Dixie Chicks are in the news again, they're on Diane Sawyer. I don't know if you saw -- they posed naked on the current issue of 'Entertainment Weekly.' You think that will get President Bush's attention? President Clinton, maybe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They asked President Bush today if he saw the magazine, and he said after looking at the pictures he does not believe that they are natural blondes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;France today has asked Iran to allow more thorough international inspections of its nuclear program. And if Iran won't do it, France is threatening to -- you know, ask again!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gay rights groups are calling for the resignation of Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania for comparing homosexuality to bigamy, polygamy, incest and adultery. Apparently, he's tried them all and found them similar.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What Santorum said was, he said he is not against homosexuals, he is against homosexual acts. He feels the only thing you should put in your mouth is your foot, basically.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The two Southwest pilots were fired after being caught in the cockpit naked! They were naked in the cockpit. Now their lawyer said they're just trying to show their support for the Dixie Chicks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Later this week, President Bush coming here to California. He's gonna meet with our own Governor Gray Davis. And the two of them together are gonna sit down and come up with the worst economic plan ever.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see this over the weekend? President Bush was on the West Lawn of the White House with his dog, you know, throwing the tennis ball. He threw it, like, two dozen times. The dog didn't go for it once. But, boy, the French Ambassador, he brought it back each and every time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, a lot of our soldiers have started to come home. Very exciting. You've seen it on the news. And I tell ya, you know, it's a tough adjustment for a lot of them. I mean, they spent the last four months driving a tank around the desert. Then they come home and they have to get used to a slightly larger SUV, you know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now the Iraqi people are very upset 'cause they say the American troops didn't protect their museums from all the looting. Hey, if they wanna keep their museums safe, put 'em next to an oil well, okay? That's what you do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the US says around $400 million was stolen from Iraq during the looting that followed the fall of Saddam. That's accord to Fox News, which, I believe, stole the $400 million.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, a Fox News engineer -- you probably heard this -- has been accused of trying to smuggle 12 Iraqi paintings out of Iraq. And another Fox reporter, Geraldo Rivera, has been accused of sneaking pictures of himself into Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's also being reported that former President Bill Clinton went to Britain three times -- three times -- to have secret meetings with Prime Minister Tony Blair before the war, which is historic. That makes the first time Clinton has ever snuck around to meet a guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today is Saddam Hussein's birthday. 66. We're not getting together this year. Normally we meet. Normally we meet at Vitello's and we have a drink.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you're looking for a last-minute gift for him, he can use a couple of new palaces, a few half-brothers -- he's missing a lot of stuff.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A colonel in the Iraqi military says he thinks Saddam Hussein may still be in Baghdad driving a cab. That's the real thing. Driving a cab. See, that's gotta be tough. One day, you're a millionaire, you're living in a palace, you're surrounded by body guards. The next day you're driving a cab. It's like 'The MC Hammer Story' all over again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And good news for Hillary Clinton. She's finally finished her book. Bad news for Bill Clinton, Hillary's finally finished her book.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary's book comes out June 9th. It's called 'Living History,' which was not the original title. The original title, we have a first printing. This is the original title. 'Why the Hell Do We Even Own a Bed?,' by Hillary Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gay rights groups are calling for the resignation of Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania for comparing homosexuality to bigamy, polygamy, incest, and adultery. And you know who's really upset? Bigamists, who have a gay lover on the side, who's also their cousin. Those people are furious. Furious!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as you know, Monica Lewinsky, she's got a show on Fox. Monica Lewinsky! Just when you thought she couldn't get any bigger...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now she's got a TV show. Her show is called 'Mr. Personality.' Which was not the original title. The original title was 'Meet the Tonsils,' but they...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You won't believe what happened to me. I almost didn't get here. Halfway up Broadway, my cab driver jumps out of the his cab and turns himself in to the coalition forces.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, I find out that my Uncle Earl turned up as the Six of Clubs in that Iraqi deck of cards. How, I said, how did that...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And big weekend coming up. Sunday, over on Fifth Avenue, it's the parade of self flagellating Shiites. So I know I'll be there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So they got this airline, Southwest Airlines, you heard of Southwest Airlines? And a flight attendant goes into the cockpit and the two pilots in there are naked. They're just sitting in their naked. And so they fired them, but their excuse was, 'Hell, we were drunk.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today is Saddam Hussein's birthday. 66 years old today. Saddam Hussein's birthday. Saddam celebrated quietly with a few close friends in hell.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know who else had a birthday yesterday? Saddam Hussein -- 66 years old. It was his birthday. In fact, I heard that at the party -- they had a party for him. Three naked women jumped out of the cake. The Dixie Chicks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are all these rumors floating around. Saddam may be alive. People wonder, how did he get out? You know how I think he got out? I think he hid in a couch and was carried out by looters.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Iraq's oil minister surrendered to US forces. This came as great news to our oil minister, Dick Cheney. He was thrilled.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And former Iraqi official, Tariq Aziz -- I just like that name. It's fun to say. Tariq Aziz with the glasses and the whole bit there -- he says Saddam Hussein is alive and wants to make a deal. He's willing to go on Primetime Live with Diane Sawyer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said he's worried now that Iraq could be overrun by religious fundamentalists. Hey, if it's good enough for the Republican Party, it's good enough for Iraq!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Later this week, President Bush coming out here to California. Boy, you thought the government of Iraq was screwed up. Wait till he sees the government in this place -- California.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear Hustler magazine's Larry Flynt now reportedly offering $1 million for this videotape of first daughter Barbara Bush nude at a party at Yale. Have you heard about this? How embarrassing is that for the first family? You spend 21 years trying to raise your daughter right -- she grows up to be a Democrat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Hillary Clinton's new book, finally due out in June. They say in the book she will discuss how her marriage works. So apparently it's a mystery.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, the book is coming out June 9th. It's called 'Living History,' which was the not the original title. The original -- we have one of the first printings. This was the original title of the book. It was called 'On Top of Everything -- Except My Husband.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With this holiday, Cinco de Mayo celebrates the victory of Mexico over the French army in 1862. Beating the French? Who hasn't done that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, last night I'm watching TV and I said to myself, 'Boy, that guy Kevin James from King of Queens -- boy, he's really gained a lot of weight.' And then I realized, 'Ah, I was watching Monica Lewinsky on 'Mr. Personality.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, what an ugly crowd. Weren't they ugly? We found out later when they left that 14, 14 of those Iraqi card guys were actually in our audience last night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me ask you a question, are you worried about SARS? Are you scared about SARS? Tom Ridge, Homeland Security Director, you know what he said today? He said you are supposed to duct tape your nose.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New York City police captured an alligator in Central Park. Now they say he is cooperating and providing valuable information.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Thursday, President Bush will declare that the war with Iraq is over. That's good news. So now he can concentrate on squandering his high approval rating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was a guy running around Baghdad, did you hear about this? He said, 'I'm in charge, I'm the mayor.' They said, 'Geez we've never had a mayor before.' For like a couple weeks he was telling everybody, 'I'm the mayor of Baghdad.' He's having like functions and doing stuff. They finally arrested the guy. Turns out, it was Sean Penn. Isn't that odd?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton, our senator from the state of New York is publishing a 600 page memoir about her years in the White House. 600 pages. To me that's pretty good for somebody who never seemed to know what the hell was going on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday was Saddam Hussein's birthday. Birthday yesterday. Yeah, and this is interesting, Pentagon officials now think that Saddam is still alive after witnesses saw a clown and a stripper going into a bunker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a new interview, Secretary of State Colin Powell repeated that the US has no plans to attack Syria or Iran. No plans. Yeah, after hearing this, Donald Rumsfeld said, 'Oh, yeah, like he'd know.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's something I read in the Wall Street Journal. According to a recent survey, one of the best businesses you can be in right now, survival supply stores. They're doing huge. You know, they sell gas masks and emergency supplies. The worst business to be in -- kissing booth at the Beijing carnival.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government said today they want to get out the message that SARS is not terrorist-related. It's a natural form of disease. That's comforting to know, huh? It's not Al Qaeda trying to kill us, it's Mother Nature now.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sure you heard this story. 12 more uniformed men surrendered last night, but enough about the Minnesota Timberwolves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Iraq yesterday, a bunch of American GIs challenged some of the local Iraqi kids to a soccer game. And the Iraqi kids won, 7-0. 7-0. Boy, that's the one game where Uday is not around to see it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, the Iraqi kids knew in advance what our team's strategy was going to be from talking to Geraldo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the liberation of Iraq continues. In fact, now, for the first time in quite a while, they're selling cosmetics and beauty products to the Iraqi women. In fact, this is like the most popular shampoo in Iraq right now. This is - 'Jihad! Your Hair Smells Terrific.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And prostitutes have returned to Baghdad. That's when you know they're getting Westernized.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They said for $100, they will Qusay your Uday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our government announced today they need to borrow $79 billion. What happened to all that money we gave them April 15th? Didn't we just give them all our dough? Are they broke already? Somebody in the Treasury Department have a gambling problem? Can we see receipts? Apparently not.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cuba has been reelected to the UN Human Rights Commission. Who says the UN is irrelevant, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Appointing Cuba to the Human Rights Commission. Isn't this like appointing Michael Jackson chaperon to the Vienna Boys Choir?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, in upstate New York, Hillary Clinton said her new book is not meant to be a history, it's a memoir. Kind of like her relationship with Bill -- not a marriage, an arrangement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the book, Hillary -- a friend of Hillary's said she will talk about Monica Lewinsky, but will not air any dirty laundry. Well, that's not fair. I mean, Hillary wouldn't even know about Monica if it wasn't for the dirty laundry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of that, the ratings for Monica Lewinsky's new show, 'Mr. Personality,' fell 29% from last week. Fell 29%. What is it about this woman? Even her ratings go down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She may have to get a desk job if it doesn't work out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new guy now in charge of Iraq is retired US General Jay Garner. Jay Garner is now running things in Iraq. Al Gore couldn't get even that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it looks like Saddam Hussein is still alive. Did you hear about this? He faxes a London newspaper. And they think it actually is Saddam Hussein, and he is still alive, and it is a current fax, because he says in the fax, he's upset with the photo they used in the deck of cards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They think it is a recent fax because it refers to Madonna's guest shot on 'Will and Grace.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They think it is a recent fax because he wishes Bob Hope a happy 100th birthday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hookers are now back on the street of Baghdad. After 25 years, there have been no hookers in Baghdad for 25 years. The hookers are now back. And of course, the question is, do you really want a hooker who was working 25 years ago?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, congratulations to New York Senator Hillary Clinton, she is publishing her memoir of her years in the White House. You know, she was there for eight years. And the book is quite a volume, 600 pages. That's an enormous book. I mean, the thing weighs almost enough for her husband to date.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tomorrow, President Bush is expected to announce that the war in Iraq is over. This is big. That's right. As a result, Bush will be able to resume his war on the English language.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big day in history. Earlier this afternoon, President Bush became the first president to land on an aircraft carrier. I saw that on the news. He landed in a jet on the Abraham Lincoln. You know, last time a president landed on something that big, he got impeached, didn't he, as I remember?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said he felt right at home on board the aircraft carrier. He said it reminded him of the Bush family yacht, only smaller, of course.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, he was on the carrier to give a speech to announce the end of combat in Iraq. Not the end of the war, the end of combat. 'Cause he warned, he said, there are still pockets of resistance. Dixie Chicks, Susan Sarandon, France, Howard Dean -- there's a list of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was reading in Variety today about the Dixie Chicks. Music industry insiders, they say the Dixie Chicks might have to change their format now to sell records. They're thinking of switching from 'Country and Western' to 'Country and Middle Eastern.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And speaking on his first visit to Baghdad since the fall of the Iraqi regime, American Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld told the Iraqi people that Iraq belongs to them. He promised that US troops would not stay one day longer than was needed to establish a democratic government, or until gas is under a buck of gallon. Either one of those.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now that Saddam's regime is out of power, prostitution has returned to the streets of Baghdad. First time in 20 years -- in 20 years. For a lot of these girls, that's going to be a long road to ho!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Right now in Florida, they're trying to decide what to do with those 6 million punch card ballots from the 2000 presidential election. They got 6 million of them. And they're trying to figure out, do they save them for historical purposes or do they destroy them? I got an idea. How about counting them! Why don't we trying doing that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you see those great picture on the news last night from Florida where a cat is feeding her litter of kittens, but also feeding the abandoned puppy? Did you see that? Did you? Kittens and the puppy. When he saw that, Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum accused the cat of performing unnatural acts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Seven passengers on a Northwest Airlines flight were slightly injured when a runaway beverage cart rolled down the entire length of the plane, whacked seven people in the knee, yeah. Luckily, one of the pilots was able to shoot out its tires before it did any damage to the rest of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's like a nightmare flying. You have drunk pilots. You have pilots -- you have naked pilots now! No wonder nobody wants -- it's actually safer now to go on Amtrak. I never thought I'd say that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems like Saddam Hussein is still alive. Have you heard about this? He's been faxing a London newspaper. And the faxes, honestly, he's faxing this newspaper, and the faxes are current. In the most recent fax, he thanks the Dixie Chicks for their support.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But here's good news. Earlier tonight, Bush announced the war against Iraq has been won. It's all over, it's been won. I believe this would be Bush's first uncontested victory.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Before the announcement, Bush landed on the deck of an aircraft carrier in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. The last president to make a landing on something that big was...Bill Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight, just before his nationally televised speech -- this was very dramatic, and I think everyone was watching. President Bush flew on a combat jet and landed on an aircraft carrier. Pretty neat, yeah. Yeah, he flew in. Got in, yeah. Yeah, not only that, next week, the President will go for a ride on a big red fire engine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, the Chinese government launched China's first 24-hour news channel. That's right. Yeah, and since the channel will only report stories that are favorable to the ruling party, they decided to call it Fox News.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush made history yesterday by becoming the first president to land a jet plane on a moving aircraft carrier. First time a president has ever done a tail hook landing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not to confuse that with Bill Clinton, who hooked a lot of tail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even though Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld was visiting Iraq, today President Bush flew into even more dangerous enemy territory -- California. So how nervous do you think Sean Penn and Tim Robbins were when they saw President Bush buzzing Malibu in a Navy jet?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see Bush in the flight suit? He looked natural. I mean, he looked like he wore it every day. It was like seeing Dick Cheney in a hospital gown.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is now in California. You know, this state is so broke I think our best chance is to surrender and try and get Bush to give us some of the Iraqi rebuilding money. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big question now, how long is the United States going to stay in iraq? How long is it going to take to rebuild the country? That's the question everybody is asking. Well, look at the facts. You've got government workers and building contractors under the control of politicians who are spending our tax dollars. Well, that should move like greased lightning, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now that Saddam Hussein is gone, prostitutes have returned to Iraq. ... So they now have prostitutes in Baghdad for the first time in 20 years. See, that finally explains all those rallies where you saw the guys walking down streets, whacking themselves with chains. After 20 years of cold showers, that wasn't working anymore, you know?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And happy Cinco de Mayo, everybody. Cinco de Mayo today. For those of you not familiar with Cinco de Mayo, it's a holiday celebrated by over 80 million Mexicans -- and that's just here in LA.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well if you don't know, Cinco de Mayo -- do you know what it celebrates? It celebrates the battle of Puebla, where the Mexicans beat the French -- which is so hard to do.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But imagine if the French had won. Not only would people be sneaking across the border, but they'd be rude, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And congratulations to Funny Cide, winner of the Kentucky Derby. I read today something like $1.6 million was waged at the Kentucky Derby. But enough about Bill Bennett.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to Newsweek magazine, the nation's self-appointed moral policeman -- you know Bill Bennett, wrote the Book of Virtues, he wrote the Death of Outrage about the Clinton impeachment. Apparently a high-stakes gambler. Has lost as much as $8 million at various casinos. $8 million! And that was just on the nickel slots. Oh, man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But he said today, gambling is a personal matter, and he's not doing anything illegal, and it's nobody's business -- or as he calls that in his book, &quot;The Clinton Defense.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who's really outraged about his gambling? The politicians. The politicians -- well, they're outraged at Bennett's actions. Gambling with his own money? Who does that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, folks, it started already. The candidates getting ready for the 2004 election. So far, the frontrunners for the Democrats are, I guess, Dick Gephardt, Senator John Kerry, former Governor Howard Dean and Senator Joe Lieberman. Or as Bush calls them, Ace of Spades, 2 of Clubs, King of Diamonds, Queen of Hearts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about this? The US Energy Department is developing a new type of gas that they say enhances the power of our nuclear bombs. Is that really a problem, our bombs not having enough bang in them lately?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Wall Street Journal has published a Treasury Department plan that calls for training stock brokers in Iraq on how to make money. Iraq? How about training our stupid stock brokers how to make some money?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Syria has promised to cooperate with the war on terrorism. To prove it, they've begun closing down their terrorist offices in Damascus. Why do terrorists need an office? I mean, there's a lot of paperwork involved in terrorism?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To give you an idea how scary&quot; the SARS epidemic is, &quot;today France surrendered to China.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big movie over the weekend, $85 million. X-Men II is big, anybody see the big X-Men? For those of you who don't anything know about it, it is about a group of mutants, and they want to take over he world. And it's characters like Storm, The Storm, another character is Night Crawler, wants to take over the world, then you have Donald Rumsfeld, wants to take over the world. Crazy! Just goes crazy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Democrats, bless their heart, had their first presidential debate over the weekend. Nine guys showed up for the big presidential debate. What a dreary group, did you see any of these guys? George Bush took a look at them and said, 'You know, I may actually win this one fair and square.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Richard Gephardt was appealing to the Democratic base, he promised to bring sex back to the Oval Office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what happened on Saturday? The first nude flight ever took off from Miami. That's right. ... It was an all nude flight, even the terrorists were naked.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, folks it's finally happened. President Bush has come up with what he thinks is a sound economic plan. He announced it today. Gonna give all the money in the Treasury it to William Bennett, let him bet it on red.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's the big story this week. William 'Dice' Bennett, the man -- I guess they call him our moral policeman, he's the author of The Book of Virtues, admits now he's lost $8 million gambling in casinos. In fact, his newest book -- Joe, do you have that here? This just came today. It's 'Bill Bennett's Las Vegas on 50 Grand a Day.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, he's been the leading voice on family values. Unfortunately, the families are the Gambino family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I thought the only thing Republicans gambled on was the economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We should've suspected something was up when Bennett kept referring to the Treasury as 'house money.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Bennett said it's a private matter and it's nobody's business but his own. See that's the difference between Democrats and Republicans right there. Right there in a nutshell. Democrats want to investigate your finances and keep their sex lives private. Republicans want to investigate your sex life -- ooh, but keep your finances private!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm just trying to figure out who lost more this year -- Bennett on the slots or Governor Gray Davis on the budget? I'm not sure which one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apparently, just before the war with Iraq started, Saddam Hussein's son Qusay took $1 billion in cash out of Iraq's Central Bank. They hauled it away in three tractor trailer trucks. $1 billion! Boy, how'd you like to get stuck behind him at the ATM, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And we've captured another one of the people on the deck of cards. This one known as Mrs. Anthrax. This is like people from the X-Men movie now. Chemical Ali, Mrs. Anthrax.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about this woman? She's like one of the leading biological scientists in Iraq. Mrs. Anthrax. It must have been tough to get people to open letters from her, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you heard Saddam Hussein, now that he's gone, prostitutes have returned to Iraq for the first time in 20 years. Yes. In fact, Iraqi prostitutes have a new slogan -- now you don't have to walk a mile for a camel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Prostitutes on the streets of Baghdad. See, this proves that a democratic government is right around the corner. 'Cause any time you have hookers -- congressmen, they can't be far behind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here is good news, coalition forces have captured Dr. Germ. They have captured Dr. Germ. She is also known as Mrs. Anthrax there, but I believe 'Anthrax' was actually her maiden name.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here is more good news, the first Burger King has opened in Baghdad. That's exciting isn't it. A lot of folks working there, the Eight of Clubs, the Jack of Diamonds, the King of Spades.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of Saddam Hussein's son, Qusay his son Qusay. Takes three tractor trailer trucks, goes to the bank with a note from his father and steals a billion dollars in cash. That rat bastard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, he was invited to join the Republican Party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Democrat Joe Lieberman as you know is running for president, and I think he must be serious because last week, his wife, Hadassa, had her name legally changed to 'Meg.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So far there's like nine or ten Democratic candidates. Have you seen these guys? They are actually a pretty dull group. Do you know what I'm talking about? I think it's good they are dull because there's very little chance anybody will be getting laid in the Oval Office now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top Ten President Bush Excuses For Not Finding Weapons Of Mass Destruction: 10. We've only looked through 99% of the country. 9. We spent the entire budget making those playing cards. 8. Containers are labeled in some crazy language. 7. They must have been stolen by some of them evil X-Men mutants. 6. Did I say Iraq has weapons of mass destruction? I meant they have goats. 5. How are we supposed to find weapons of mass destruction? We can't even find Cheney. 4. We're still screwed up because of daylight savings time. 3. When you're trying to find something, it's always in the last place you look. Am I right, people? 2. Let's face it - I ain't exactly a genius. 1. Geraldo took them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, of course, was Cinco de Mayo. Cinco de Mayo, that's right. Yeah, when asked if he celebrated Cinco de Mayo, President Bush said, 'No, I'm still mad at the French.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been reported that just before the war started, just before the war started, Saddam Hussein withdrew $1 billion from Iraq's Central Bank. $1 billion. Yeah, after hearing about the $1 billion, President Bush vowed to hunt Saddam down and give him a huge tax cut.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wow, what a crowd! Man! Good crowd. You sound like William Bennett when he saw the three cherries come up on the slot machine. Yeah!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember, you can't spell Bennett without the letters 'b-e-t.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;William Bennett, former Drug Czar, former Secretary of Education, also wrote The Book of Virtues. Now he admits he lost over $8 million gambling. God, he's like Pete Rose with a better hair cut now.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, did you hear what Bennett's lawyer said today? I love this. He said his client was not gambling, it was just part of his Indian outreach program.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bennett said today, 'My gambling days are over.' He's only gonna be playing slots at night now. Apparently, that's the new thing. No more day time stuff.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Democrats love to bring up this William Bennett thing because they say it makes up for Clinton's, you know, indiscretions. See, the difference between Bennett and Clinton is, you see, when Bennett hits on 17, it's not someone's daughter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dick Cheney has announced he has agreed to be President Bush's running mate in 2004, once again. Cheney says he wants four more years as Vice President. I get the feeling that Dick Cheney would be happy to get four more years at anything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, they said the only thing that could keep him from running is one more double bacon cheeseburger.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Democratic Senator Robert Byrd called George Bush a desk-bound President, who assumes the garb of a warrior -- criticizing Bush for wearing a flight suit on the aircraft carrier Lincoln. I'm sorry. I thought Bush looked pretty good in a flight suit. Show that. I though he looked pretty good. I thought he looked good in a uniform. He's the Commander-in-Chief. You might remember Byrd was once in the Ku Klux Klan. Show him in his uniform. Yeah, you see?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush's Budget Director, Mitch Daniels, resigned yesterday. He didn't want to. But, hey, when you don't have a budget, you don't need a director basically.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld has recommended that a New Mexico oil man be named Secretary of the Navy. See, this is the Republican idea of diversity, having a New Mexico oil man working hand in hand with a Texas oil man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Democrats had their first debate of the 2004 presidential campaign this past week. Anybody see it? No -- nobody saw it. No -- nobody. Nobody watched it. It was eight men and one woman. It looked like a bad version of 'The Bachelorette.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Florida Senator Bob Graham launched his White House bid. He wants to run for president. And of course, when you think of electing someone to the White House, the first state you think of -- Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who Bob Graham is? He's like Dick Gephardt without the charisma, basically is who he is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So he's a white guy named Graham from the South. So, I guess that would make him a Graham cracker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The University of California Berkeley is not gonna allow students from China or any other Asian country affected by the SARS virus to enroll for the summer session. See, this is wrong. This is not good. If we start banning Asian students from our schools, who are the American kids gonna cheat off of?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's some sad news. 60 Minutes will end their weekly Clinton-Dole debates, you know that segment they had? Too bad, CBS was hoping that Bob Dole would bring in that younger audience.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So far we have captured 20 of the 55 in the Iraqi deck of cards. That's pretty good, 20 out of the 55. Yeah still missing, Saddam Hussein, we have not found Saddam Hussein. His two sons, we have not found his two sons. We have not found Sean Penn. So they're still at large.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's another audio tape from Saddam Hussein, a brand new Saddam Hussein audiotape, it's a 15 minute monologue, Saddam Hussein is doing a 15-minute monologue. And he closes with a Clinton joke.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top Ten Reasons I, Joe Lieberman, Would Make A Great President (As Read By Joe Lieberman): 10. Not only will my vice president be in an undisclosed location, I won't even reveal who he is. 9. I know Microsoft Excel and can type 65 words per minute. 8. I've gotten a lot of good advice from Martin Sheen. 7. Instead of taking Air Force One, I can use all of my accumulated frequent flier miles. 6. Saddam's a president, and I'm way less nuts than he is. 5. I will change the Constitution to guarantee every American a free DVD player. 4. I am very comfortable in oval-shaped rooms. 3. It just so happens Spider- Man is a close, personal friend of mine. 2. I won't take any crap from France. 1. Look at me. Do you honestly think there'll be a sex scandal?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oprah Winfrey has decided to not quit her show, and she has signed a brand-new contract, listen to this, that will pay her $140 million a year. Yeah. Yeah, in a related story, President Bush has hired Oprah Winfrey to rebuild Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just before the war started, Saddam Hussein filled up three tractor trailers with $1 billion in cash and drove the money out of the country. That's right. Yeah, unfortunately, for Saddam, the truckers already spent most of the money on jerky.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Florida Senator Bob Graham announced that he is running for President despite the fact that he had double bypass surgery earlier this year. That's right. Yeah, yeah. Political experts don't give Graham much chance because his campaign slogan is, 'I'm a little healthier than Dick Cheney.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[From &quot;Find The Pattern&quot; segment] &quot;Joe Lieberman. Dick Gephardt. Howard Dean. John Kerry. That's right, these men are more and more likely to be the Democratic Party's choice to blow the 2004 presidential campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dick Cheney announced he has agreed to be President Bush's running mate once again in 2004. He made the announcement -- actually made it yesterday while riding in 'Ambulance One.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, he's got a new campaign slogan - 'No chest pain, no gain.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, but he said he wants four more years, which is pretty good. Unfortunately, his doctor's only giving him two more years.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, those Clinton/Dole debates on 60 Minutes, not doing well. The ratings are really bad. And in fact, there's talk that maybe -- may not be back next season. They said to be renewed, Bob Dole would have to be charming, and Clinton would have to come off as more honest. So, in other words -- they're screwed basically.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you watched it? It is kind of dull, isn't it? You know, if they want some real fireworks, they should have Bill arguing with Hillary. I'd pay to see that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Las Vegas now, starting to get rid of that family image thing. They tried it for a while. The family thing wasn't working. So they're going back to more of an adult theme. And you probably heard their slogan. This is the new slogan - 'What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.' Yeah. Including $8 million of Bill Bennett's money, basically.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's a great story that -- William Bennett, the man they call the moral voice of America, lost almost $8 million playing slot machines. And here's the amazing part -- he still has a better economic plan than President Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Democrats are very upset that President Bush flew onto an aircraft carrier dressed as a fighter pilot. They said, 'Oh, it was just a campaign stunt.' I don't know. I mean, before that he visited the Boeing plant, remember? Put on the construction worker hat. Then he went to his ranch, put on the cowboy hat. Then last week he met with a cop, put on a motorcycle helmet. I think he's trying to join the Village People.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mayor Bloomberg, the Mayor of New York City, how many of you did not know it was Mayor Bloomberg? I just found out today. Mayor Bloomberg's approval ratings are at an all time low, 32%. Now, let me put that in perspective for you. Saddam Hussein is at 37%.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, I heard that coalition forces found a mobile bio-terror laboratory in Iraq. It is a germ laboratory on wheels, or as we call it in the United States, Dominos.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, yesterday there was an announcement from Washington, Dick Cheney said he is going to run again. He said my health is fine. I have a doctor with me 24 hours a day. That's always the sign of a man in good health isn't it? Got your doctor living with you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;US forces have captured the Two of Hearts in the Iraqi deck of cards. That makes 20 out of 55 captured. So that's pretty good. Oddly enough - - the Eight of Clubs: Winona Ryder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Bush Administration announced the other day that it doesn't want the Federal Government to run Amtrak anymore. Doesn't want them to do it. Yeah, or, as it was explained to President Bush, 'Choo choo go bye-bye.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been reported that '60 Minutes' might cancel the debate between former President Clinton and former Senator Bob Dole. Might cancel it. Yeah. As a result, when Clinton wants an argument, he'll have to go home to Hillary -- where he'll get one.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush went to the University of South Carolina, where he gave the commencement speech. He was very encouraging. He told the students, 'Sure the economy is tough, things look bad, but if they manage to graduate with a C-minus average and have the right connections, they could end up President of the United States.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, last week, President Bush landed on an aircraft carrier. Not to be outdone, earlier today, William Bennett landed on a riverboat casino in New Orleans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, they're all going after Bush for landing that jet plane on the aircraft carrier. Now Representative Henry Waxman of California has asked for a full accounting of the cost of the flight. These Democrats say Bush could have saved a lot of money by flying in on a Tuesday and then staying over one Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And earlier in the week, Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia criticized Bush. I thought it was great landing on the aircraft carrier. I got a big kick out of it. But he called President Bush 'A desk-bound president.' You think he's a desk-bound President? Bill Clinton, now that was a desk- bound president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House now trying to get international cooperation for finding that Iran has violated an agreement not to produce nuclear weapons. However, political experts say something really drastic would have to happen for us to go to war with Iran ... You know, like finding a lot of oil there. ... I'm just hoping this problem can be solved without President Bush getting involved. I mean, really, can you imagine him trying to say 'Iranian uranium.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This Sunday is Mother's Day or as Jesse Jackson calls it, 'The busy season.' But you know, William Bennett sending his wife a dozen roses, or as he calls it, putting 100 bucks on red.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They were talking a couple of days ago about Saddam Hussein, did we kill him? Did we not? Who knows, who cares? Then they had the audio tape. Did you hear that? Did you folks here that Saddam Hussein audio tape? For those of you who missed it I made a copy of it. ... Listen closely to the words of Saddam Hussein.&quot; Fake audio tape of Saddam Hussein: &quot;I will survive, as long as I know how to love, I will stay alive. I have all my life to live, I have all my love to give, I will survive, hey, hey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Think somebody has lost their mind, because you know what they are promoting for the sweeps period? I tivo'd a promo for something called Saddam week. I Tivo'd it and I brought it in. Look at what is running next week on CBS.&quot; Fake CBS ad: &quot;CBS is the place to be, Saddam Hussein week. Get ready for a hilarious cultural clash that is out of this world. He is a big shot in Iraq but, can he handle the in-laws on 'My Big Fat Greek Life'? Tune in this weekend as Saddam Hussein gives the most powerful performance of his non-dictator career on 'Touched By An Angel.' And coming next month, Saddam Hussein vanishes on without a trace. Saddam week, be there.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's more good news. Saddam Hussein's Ba'ath Party no longer exists. Saddam Hussein's Ba'ath Party, gone. That's tough luck for New York City. We were trying to get their convention.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, the Ba'ath Party is gone. George Bush is really on a roll here. This year, the Ba'ath Party. Last year, the Democrats. Taking care of everybody.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's the amazing part. At one point, Jeffords yelled, 'Stop thief,' and 200 Congressmen froze.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Bob Wise, the Democratic Governor of West Virginia, has issued a statement acknowledging he cheated on his wife and his family. Now in West Virginia, isn't that the same thing?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, government officials unveiled a new design and new colors for the $20 bill. See, the Bush Administration doesn't have an economic plan, but if you do wind up with more money, it'll be prettier and more stylish.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kind of a bad time for William Bennett. He lost his mother earlier this year -- in a poker game.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, very exciting news -- the US Treasury unveiled a newly redesigned $20 bill that contains more colors, including -- listen to this -- light blue, pale green, and peach.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Iraqi officials are complaining that since the allied troops kicked out Saddam Hussein, food prices in Baghdad have doubled. It's true, yeah. They say the typical family has to rob two museums just to make ends meet.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, that was a heartbreaker, wasn't it? The Lakers mounted an amazing comeback, only to lose in the end when Robert Horry's shot went in and out -- just boom, and then out. In fact, after the game -- I don't know if you saw this -- one guy lying on the court, just weeping, crying uncontrollably. And it wasn't Shaq or Kobe. It turns out William Bennett lost $50 grand on the game.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you may have seen, yesterday our government unveiled the new, more colorful, $20 dollar bill. I guess the Bush Administration figures, the best time to redesign our money is when nobody has any of it.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yet another book out on former President John F. Kennedy. This one by Frank Sinatra's former valet. So, it must be accurate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to George Jacobs, President Kennedy's numerous affairs never affected his work. He said he reviewed Kennedy's daily schedule, and none of his affairs affecter his ability to do his job. But, then again, it didn't affect Clinton's work, either. No, no -- hey, when Clinton had his affairs, he never left his desk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, of course, is Wednesday. Or as the Governor of West Virginia calls it -- hump day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, folks, it happened again. Those gosh darn Democrats -- yes siree, bob -- West Virginia Governor Bob Wise in trouble for admitting he had an affair with a married woman. A state employee. Wise says this week he is deeply sorry for letting his wife down, for letting his children down, and most of all, for letting his pants down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey. Good thing for him, he was only Governor. Imagine if he was an Alabama football coach -- he could've lost his job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Holiday Inn has a new promotion. Texas Democratic lawmakers stay free.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;50 Democrats -- state representatives from Texas -- are holed up in a hotel across the border in Oklahoma now to protest this redistricting thing by the Texas Republicans. The don't wanna go into work. See, they can't vote unless they're there. 50 Democrats in 1 hotel. Here's the amazing thing -- they all signed in, out of force of habit, as John Smith. All 50 Democrats each trying to sneak in the back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, I have to admit, I had a lot of fun the other day on the Today Show pretending to be a journalist. I felt like a New York Times reporter, yeah, yeah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, the New York Times in trouble for having a reporter that's made up stories, plagiarized stories -- made up, like, dozens and dozens of stories. In fact, have you seen the newest issue? Remember it used to say up here in the corner 'All The News Fit To Print?' You see what it says now? Can you get in close? 'Hey, you gotta fill the paper up with something.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;CBS, the network you're watching right now, announced all their new fall television programs, and we couldn't be more excited. They got a brand new half hour situation comedy, it's all about a guy working for the New York Times, it's called, 'Making It Up.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's good news from Iraq, ladies and gentlemen, US forces have captured another bioterror lab on wheels. Right. But then later it just turned out to be a sidewalk falafel cart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm so excited about the new Matrix movie. Are you excited about that? ... It is called Matrix reloaded and it is back with all your favorite machines, there's Lock, there's Morpheus, there's Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush toured parts of Missouri that were devastated by a recent tornado. Toured them, yeah. Yeah, there was one awkward moment when the President looked at the tornado damage and said, 'Don't worry, we're gonna get whoever did this.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A New York Times reporter, who resigned after being accused of plagiarism, may be paid as much as $1 million to tell his story in a new book. True story, yeah. Yeah, not surprisingly, the book will be called 'The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, today in Washington, a huge event -- the Million Woman March. Did you see this thing on TV? It was all the women who had sex with John F. Kennedy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's the big story. Yet another new book has come out about all the affairs of JFK and all the affairs he had in the White House. And today one of the women has come forward to say, yes, it is all true. This woman has kept this secret for 41 years that she had this affair. Her name is Mimi Fahnestock. She was 19 at the time she had the affair with President Kennedy. I can't believe Kennedy would cheat on Marilyn Monroe. I'm very upset.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She said, when she was hired as an intern, she couldn't even type. That's what she said. She said all she could do -- all she could do was dial a phone -- with her tongue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She said coming forward after all this time was a huge relief. Well, sure, she can finally take that dress to the dry cleaners. Whoo!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And she said today the affair ended in November 1963. Duh!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This book also said that Kennedy frequently enjoyed the romp -- that's what they called it -- the sexual romp with two presidential aides who were nicknamed Fiddle and Faddle. Well, you know President Clinton had a similar arrangement. Except his aides were named Humpty and Dumpty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And West Virginia Governor Bob Wise admitted this week that he was not faithful to his wife. See, I'll tell you something. I'm glad I live in California, where we don't have to worry about our Governor Gray Davis having an affair. See, he is so unpopular, I don't think any woman is gonna want to sleep with him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the price of gasoline coming down, which is good news. Experts said today this could delay the next war in the Middle East until maybe the fall.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to a CBS News poll, 66% of Americans could not name a single Democratic candidate running for President. The other 34% are Democratic candidates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, when asked about electing the president, most Americans said, 'Oh, the Supreme Court handles that, don't they?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to Fortune magazine, Ted Turner is down to his last $1 billion. Oh, well who said the economy only is hurting the little people, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Matrix opened last night. This thing is just huge. It's huge. We saw it. I tell you something. It's a real mind twister. You try to figure out what's real, what isn't -- it's like reading the New York Times. You can't tell what's real, what's fake.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well they're now saying that Jayson Blair -- he's the reporter from the New York Times -- was finally fired after lying and plagiarizing all those stories. Well they're now saying he could get up to a million bucks for his story if he wanted to write a tell-all book. This is like madness. This is my question -- who would believe the book?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I mean, what he's gonna say? 'Oh, after I climbed Mt. Everest, I set my sights on a mission to Mars.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you seen today's issue of the New York Times? Want to see what it's called now? Can you get in there? See, it's the 'New York Once Upon A Time.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you have any idea what is happening right this very minute? A lunar eclipse, that's right, a lunar eclipse is going on right now. And for a half hour, the sky is completely dark, no light whatsoever. Or as the Iraqis call it, 'prime looting time.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, Hillary Clinton, one of our Senators from the state of New York, has written a big book. It's a huge book about her, it's a memoir about her life in the White House. And she was on the Barbara Walters show, and the highlight of the show is, this is great. I wish I had thought of it. They give Hillary a complete, like a radical makeover. And she is inadvertently hit on by Bill.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this is big news out of Washington. White House spokesman Ari Fleischer now says he will retire this July. Good luck finding a job in this economy, but that's what he said.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is interesting. He said when he told President Bush he was leaving, the President ended the conversation by kissing him on the head. Which is kind of funny, because that's how Clinton began every conversation.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They said these two 'Matrix' movies, number two and three -- the last one comes out in November -- costs a combined $300 million. It makes them the most expensive sequels of all time, not counting the war in Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A man named Douglas Feith, F-E-I-T-H, I guess I'm saying that right. Feith like teeth. He told Congress that the search for Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction could take years, could take years to complete, or at least till the next presidential election, you know, whichever comes first.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the annual financial disclosure forms, President Bush is worth somewhere between $8 million and $22 million, and Vice President Dick Cheney is worth somewhere between $19 million and $86 million. Well, thanks for narrowing it down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, how come when we have to fill out the 1040 form, ooh, it is down to the last penny, but if you're in Washington, well, it's either $35 or $100 million?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More and more details coming out about that JFK intern, John F. Kennedy with a 19-year-old intern, that was unknown all those years. Supposedly, reporters once caught her on the floor of JFK's limo. No wonder the guy had such a bad back, apparently.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, I tell you. It was different back then. See, reporters -- reporters knew back then the President was cheating on his wife, but they felt it was their job, you know, to tell a different story. They felt they had to tell the story the American people wanted to believe. A tradition carried on today, of course, by the New York Times.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the last three months, three major icons have come under suspicion. The country's leading moralist, William Bennett, for gambling. A respected newspaper, the New York Times, for lying. And the Kentucky Derby, a horse race, for cheating. And here's the ironic part. The only one to come out clean is the horse race.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend here in Los Angeles, hundreds of funeral home directors, morticians and embalmers drove through the streets of LA in hearses to protest the ever-increasing amount of street violence in Los Angeles. See, that's when you know your city is the murder capital of the country -- when morticians are protesting. 'Stop! We can't take any more business. Stop!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, how many watched that stupid Hitler movie last night on CBS? You watch that thing? All right, listen to this. The guy playing Hitler was so good, that during the broadcast, French TV viewers actually surrendered.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier tonight on NBC, they had a movie, a movie all about Martha Stewart, you know? Also known as the Eight of Clubs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, listen to this. By the way, we have captured Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein earlier today. I guess it's true, I read it in the New York Times. Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Broadway musical, Les Miserables...closed last night after 16 years and 6,600 performances. Yeah. Take that, France!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I mean, what are we supposed to do? Now it's orange. They said today be on the lookout for anything suspicious. In fact, for example, Randy on 'American Idol' sang a sentence that does not end in the word 'dog.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Pakistan, a new terrorist group over there has sprung up, and is going around blowing up gas stations. Just blowing up gas stations. Boy, you thought Bush was mad at Saddam Hussein. What's he gonna do to these guys?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US military now using the music of Metallica and other heavy metal bands to break the will of Saddam Hussein supporters to get them to talk. They're blaring heavy metal music at them. Well, that should make the artists feel pretty good, huh? You put your heart and soul into your last CD - the Army is using it to torture people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to inside sources, there could be two, possibly three Supreme Court resignations next month. President Bush said today he wants all the Supreme Court justices to stay on -- at least until after he's reelected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After making remarks criticizing President Bush, actor Danny Glover has been dropped as a spokesman for MCI. They dropped him because of his political views. Yeah. So apparently MCI will give you a great deal on long-distance calling -- you just have to be careful what you say on the phone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in Hillary Clinton's new book 'Living History,' Hillary details what it was like meeting Bill Clinton, falling in love with him, getting married and living a passionate, wonderful life together as husband and wife. Then on page two, the trouble starts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, 'Mr. Personality' is over. And now Monica Lewinsky is looking for a new job. Isn't she always?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As I mentioned in the monologue, White House press secretary Ari Fleischer leaving his post. He says he's doing it so he can enter the private sector and spend more time with his family. As you know, whenever a public figure changes jobs, there's always more going on than they're telling you. So let's take a look at some of the real reasons Ari Fleischer is leaving the White House. For example, here's one. He was offered the presidency of the Hair Club For Men.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Real reason Ari Fleischer is leaving the White House: &quot;He got tired of playing Scrabble with President Bush and having to say over and over again, 'Mr. President, that's not a word!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Real reason Ari Fleischer is leaving the White House: &quot;He didn't like wearing the flight attendant's uniform on Air Force One.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Real reason Ari Fleischer is leaving the White House: &quot;He was sick and tired of being Condoleeza Rice's boy toy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Real reason Ari Fleischer is leaving the White House: &quot;He was afraid he might have to give Dick Cheney mouth to mouth resuscitation and he hates the taste of pastrami.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Real reason Ari Fleischer is leaving the White House: &quot;He was tired of reporter Helen Thomas throwing her panties at him during press conferences.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Saddam Hussein's brother-in-law has been arrested by coalition forces. That's good news, huh? They acted on a tip from Saddam Hussein.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me get this straight. Saddam's three ex-wives have fled the country. His brother-in-law has been arrested. Boy, we're really making his life a living hell, aren't we?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, White House spokesman Ari Fleischer announced that he's leaving his job. Yeah, after 21 years in government, Fleischer said he wants to lie in the private sector.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as you know, our Department of Homeland Security has moved us up to a orange -- is it orange now? Or high alert. High alert. But they said this is just a temporary precaution until Martha Stewart calms down after that movie they made.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, I don't wanna say Martha's upset, but today on her TV show, she was showing how to make an AK-47 out of paper clips, duct tape and some old pine cones.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A scary incident just a few hours ago. You folks probably didn't hear about this. Big explosion at Yale Law School. Luckily, nobody was hurt. But big explosion at Yale Law School. Although nine of the lawyers are now claiming whiplash.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A man claiming to be Osama bin Laden's right-hand man released a new videotape calling for more attacks on America. You know, how short is the attention span of these terrorists? They have to be reminded every two weeks with new videotapes. 'What is that? Oh, that's right. We're supposed to attack America.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Bush Administration is now saying there will be a delay in restoring a democratically-elected government to Iraq. However, they said the delay would not be as long as the one we've had in this country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Christie Todd Whitman, who's head of the EPA, has announced she's resigning next month. She's stepping down. President Bush was shocked. He didn't know he had a Environmental Protection Agency.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Republicans, once again insisting that President Bush's tax cut is a matter of principle. Principle on the trust fund. Principal on the yacht.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, here's a very bizarre story. Five Cubans who tried to sail to Florida got lost -- ended up in Mexico. Oh, they'll never make it to this country now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday was election day here in LA. In case you haven't heard the results -- Who Cares beat out Someone I Never Heard Of.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was very close. Over 300 people voted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And nearly 13,000 high school seniors in Florida will not graduate this year because they failed the state achievement tests. However, many of them will go on to play football for Florida State.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, I don't want to alarm anybody, but the terror alert system here in New York City, we're now at a level orange. Level orange. So, have a great holiday, everybody!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me tell you, that level orange, everybody in New York City is a little edgy. Today my cab driver panicked. I'm driving to work and my cab driver panics when he spotted himself in the mirror.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You have SARS, you have mad cow disease, you have the orange alert, I'm telling you, the news is so bad the New York Times doesn't have to make it up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it's not all bad news, here's some good news. Crime in New York City is down, ladies and gentlemen, I think that's a lovely thing. I'll tell you how low the crime rate is right now. It must have been, I bet months since the last time I had to say, 'Now, did he fire five or six shots?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it is exciting developments in Times Squares. Madam Toussad's Wax Museum unveiled the new statue of Jennifer Lopez. This statue is so lifelike, it was hit on by the statue of Bill Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Christie Whitman, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, announced that she's resigning. Yeah, yeah, reportedly, President Bush was shocked 'cause he didn't know there was an Environmental Protection Agency. No idea.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sure you all watched Ruben win American Idol last night. ... I'll tell you what's interesting. After he lost, Al Gore called Clay and said, 'You got screwed!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Ruben only won by margin of 130,000 votes, out of 24 million. American Idol -- sounds more like American President, doesn't it?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Democrats in Congress are calling President Bush's $350 billion tax cut reckless and irresponsible. See, this is what I love about politicians. They spend billions on the star wars technology. That didn't work. They're fine with that. They spend billions on subsidies for tobacco farms. That's okay. Give billions to corporations. That's fine. But give some money back to the taxpayer -- what are you, nuts?! That's crazy!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today President Bush urged the passage of a new law that would allow timber companies to thin the national forest in order to protect them. He also has a plan to allow oil companies to release all the pressure building up from the oil under the Arctic Wildlife Reserve.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Saudi Arabia said today they have foiled a major Al Qaeda operation. So apparently they canceled the check.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you heard a bomb went off at Yale University yesterday. Pretty scary. Luckily, no one was injured. In fact, today when they asked President Bush for a comment, he said, 'Aww, that's nothing. I used to get bombed at Yale all the time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Jim Carrey's got a new movie coming out. And in the movie, it's about a man who acts like God. I think it's called 'The Bill O'Reilly Story.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This cab driver, I guess from Queens or something, was arrested for trying to buy explosives. Yeah, everybody is a little nervous about this, and this morning I'm driving to work and I was a little suspicious of my cab driver, because you know the photo ID that they have on the dashboard? This guy's picture was on the Eight of Clubs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This exciting story from the world of sports, this weekend, Anika Sorenstam, is playing at a men's golf tournament...in Texas. The thing's a big event. First time a woman has played in the PGA in like 57 years or something like that. ... It's so important, the New York Times is pretending to send three reporters down there to cover it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The former Governor of New Jersey and head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Christine Todd Whitman, has resigned, did you hear about this? She quit. Two reasons, Bush felt she was too soft on decimating pristine wilderness. And she was too hung up on that breathable air issue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As part of the anti-terror campaign, the government has declared the airspace over Disney theme parks no fly zones. That's true. That's true. Yeah. Yeah, the news came too late for Tinkerbell, who was shot down by an F-15.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, the United Nations approved a resolution to lift the sanctions on Iraq. That's right. Yeah, yeah. Good thing, yeah. It's a very good thing. Yeah, the move will allow Iraqis to buy things they don't have, such as medicine and weapons of mass destruction.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush was in France for the big G-8 summit. Actually, one embarrassing moment. President Clinton showed up. See, he thought it was the G-Spot summit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I guess while President Bush was over there, a lot of protesting -- people throwing rocks, breaking windows. Great. Now the French start fighting.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, President Bush had a little bit of fun with Chirac, the French President today. Did you see that? Show him on the news. Watch this. It's kind of sly of Bush here. Now, look. See -- see, he sticks that sign on his back. See, 'Kick me, I'm French.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to USA Today, the French President, Jacques Chirac, loves Native American culture. And President Bush gave the French President three books on Indian culture. I guess these are the actual books he gave him. There's 'Beat the Dealer.' That's one there. 'Winning at Casino Slots.' And 'A Guide to Gambling.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush left the summit a day early after giving economic advice to the other world leaders. Bush, giving economic advice? What, is M.C. Hammer not available? What? What, did Gray Davis turn them down?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congress has passed President Bush's $350 billion tax cut plan. The Bush Administration says this is great news for people who don't have a job -- you know, like the independently wealthy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And over the weekend, suspected Olympic Park bomber -- what's that guy's name? Eric Robert Rudolph was arrested. ... And the police officer who found the Olympic bomber was this rookie -- rookie cop, only been on the job ten months. Ten months, and he found him. See, this is the guy we should send to look for Osama bin Laden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The FCC voted to allow big media companies to own more television stations and newspapers. They believe this improves the American people's ability to get a single viewpoint instead of being confused by a bunch of different ones.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the story in the tabloid, The Weekly World News -- you ever see this tabloid? They have a front page headline this week that a scaly skinned alien baby has been found in Casper, Wyoming. It's nice to that writer from the New York Times getting some work, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to reports, Osama bin Laden is broke, he has no more money. Tough luck for the guy, hey? He's apparently had to move to a cave in a cheaper neighborhood. That's what he had to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought this story was fascinating. Whitney Houston and her husband, Bobby Brown, have gone to Israel to meet with Ariel Sharon. I know you're thinking, 'Dave's been reading the New York Times again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Clinton wants a law that would allow former presidents to run again for President. You know? And I think that's a great idea, I mean, talk about a return to the golden age of comedy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, President Bush is in France for the big G-8 summit, you know. And he's got quite a sense of humor, President Bush. And it's interesting, every time somebody over there at the big G-8 summit says 'G-8,' President Bush yells, 'Bingo!'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, earlier this week, President Bush met with French President Jacques Chirac for the first time since France came out against the war in Iraq. It was kind of hard for them to communicate, 'cause, you know, Chirac's English is not very good, and, of course, Bush's English is even worse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, did you see the pictures of the two of them standing there? I haven't seen forced smiles on two people like that since the last time Bill and Hillary stood together, basically.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, of course, President Bush, he didn't make things anything easier when he pointed to the Eiffel Tower and said to Chirac, 'That's a hell of an oil derrick you got there, yeah.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But to try and break the tension a little bit, President Bush gave President Chirac a book on American Indians. Apparently he is a huge fan of Native American culture. In fact, Chirac even has an Indian name, 'Dances With Iraqis.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today, President Bush is in the Middle East this week to promote his Middle East peace plan. See, I -- I'm not sure Bush quite gets it. Like today, he said everything would work out in the Middle East if the Palestinians and the Israelis would just start acting like good Christians.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Sean Penn has published a 4,000-word essay in Friday's New York Times, defending his visit to Iraq and his position on the war, which is pretty amazing: A writer for the New York Times who actually visited the place he was writing about. Has that ever happened? I believe this is a first.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, still no word on Osama bin Laden. No word on Saddam Hussein. But Federal authorities said today they may be closing in on Martha Stewart. So, yes!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now Martha Stewart said today she has word that she will probably be indicted tomorrow. She's still getting inside information. How does she do it? How does she know that she's going to be indicted tomorrow?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know why the Feds are after Martha Stewart? Do you know the real reason? The White House now believes she has weapons of mass destruction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I guess you know, in North Carolina, suspected serial bomber Eric Rudolph has been arrested. In fact, when police arrested him, he gave the police a phony name -- Richard Jewell.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the tabloid -- I guess the National Enquirer has this story. Apparently, there is security footage of President Clinton. You know about this? Apparently, there is now security footage of President Clinton having sex with a woman in a truck, back when he was Governor of Arkansas. Security camera footage. Now, remember, this is when he was governor. So the women will not be of the caliber of Paula Jones and Monica Lewinsky.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday in Washington, the FCC voted to allow the big media companies -- God bless them, we don't have enough of them -- the big media companies to own more TV stations and newspapers. See, under the new rule now, a single company, one company could control all the information reaching 45% of the national audience. 45%, which, of course, is enough now to elect the president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier tonight over on NBC they had the annual Miss Universe pageant. ... I love the talent portion of the competition. And Miss Iraq was competing this year. And her talent was looting an appliance store.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Miss New York was of course in the Miss Universe pageant. Her talent was breaking into a Lexus with a wire coat hanger while smoking a cigarette.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Miss Canada was also in the Miss Universe pageant. She was wearing a bikini and a SARS mask.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, George Bush, you know he left the G-8 convention, conference. whatever they call it, in France. He's in Egypt right now. He is very excited. He said he always wanted to see where they taped the $20,000 Pyramid. That's what he said.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here is some more bizarre information about Saddam Hussein. Apparently now he is not dead. He is hiding out in the suburbs of Baghdad. Do you believe that? Neighbors say that he is sullen, he is moody. He rarely comes out of the house. He sends bodyguards out for supplies. No, wait that's me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, you know the number one movie in the country now is that cartoon, 'Finding Nemo.' How many of you have seen 'Finding Nemo?' It's a wonderful movie. Kids love it. I believe it's based on a game that President Clinton used to play with the interns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top 10 Things Agreed Upon At The G-8 Summit: 10. The 'G' in 'G-8' stands for gravy. 9. Jacques Chirac's influence is severely hampered by his silly rhyming name. 8. German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has a lovely singing voice. 7. If you leave 'Finding Nemo' with a dry eye, call the morgue - you're dead! 6. The translator for the Russian delegation is a total babe. 5. You think relations in the Middle East are bad, check in with Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez in a couple of years. 4. The global economic downturn is the result of a glitch in the Matrix. 3. George W. Bush really has to stop saying, 'I could have had a G-8.' 2. The summit's in France, which means the New York Times reporter is probably in Brooklyn. 1. Whoever finds Saddam Hussein wins a 2003 Pontiac Aztek.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush's daughter, Jenna, is moving to New York for the summer so she can take classes at NYU. Isn't that nice? Yeah, Jenna was quick to point out that unlike her father, she's choosing to go to summer school.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The California Senate has approved a bill that would give users of medical marijuana special ID cards designed to protect them from arrest. Yeah, the ID cards will be available by November 1st, and the fake IDs by November 2nd.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was watching America's Most Wanted. No, I'm sorry, that was Martha Stewart Living. I'm sorry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Feds hit Martha today - 41-page indictment. Whew! 41 pages. To give you an idea how much trouble she's in, they only had 16 pages on Saddam Hussein, okay? That's bad.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, even though Martha was indicted today, she says she will not step down as CEO of her company. She says she'll run it from prison, you know, like John Gotti did.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you all know about Hillary Clinton's book. Whoo! This is gonna be the hot book. It comes out on Monday. Hillary says in the book, when Clinton finally admitted to her about the affair, she says she could hardly breathe and was gulping for air -- gulping for air. No, I'm sorry. That's Monica's book. I'm sorry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary says when Bill finally came clean about Monica, she said she was dumbfounded, heartbroken and outraged that she'd believed his lies. Well, you know what they say. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me 6,000 more times -- shame on me!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see this week's National Enquirer? They're like the New York Times. According to the National Enquirer, apparently there is a videotape of President Clinton having sex with another woman. Actual physical evidence of him having sex. Anybody amazed? I'm not amazed by this, you know? Evidence of Clinton having sex with Hillary -- that would be an amazing thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apparently there's security camera footage of Clinton having sex in a truck with this woman when he was Governor. Sex in a truck -- or as they call that in Arkansas, the bridal suite.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Knowing Clinton, that may not have been a truck -- that may have been the woman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's one very telling moment on the security tape, when Clinton looks up, looks directly into the camera and says, 'I am not having sex with this woman.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in international news, positive news for President Bush. Both sides of the Middle East are signing off on his road map to peace. The bad news -- the Israelis think the map goes through the West Bank, the Palestinians think it goes through downtown Jerusalem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this week marks the official beginning of the California fire season. And of course the big concern that everyone's worried about, California's so far in debt, they think California Governor Gray Davis may try to burn it down for the insurance money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And now, oh, my God, you know, Hillary Clinton, who is now Senator from New York and used to be, well, still is married to the President, you remember Bill Clinton? Well, when they were married and lived together in the White House there for eight years and she's got this huge book, it's a memoir of her life and times in the White House. And in the book she says that when Bill told her he was having an affair, she said, and I thinks it's a quote, she said, 'I could hardly breathe, I was gulping for air.' No, no. I'm sorry. That's what Monica said.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today in New York, Martha Stewart was indicted by a Federal grand jury for insider trading. Yeah, as a result, today on her show, Martha showed how to exchange cigarettes for favors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, President Bush told Arab leaders that he will -- listen to this. It's a quote. 'Put in as much time as necessary to achieve peace in the Middle East.' That's what he said. Yeah, yeah. ... Yeah, Bush said the only exception is Monday because The King of Queens is on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In her brand new book, Hillary Clinton says that when President Clinton confessed about his affair with Monica, she wanted to 'wring his neck.' Yeah. Yeah, yeah, that's what she said. Yeah, Hillary decided against it when she realized choking Bill would only enhance his orgasm.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know by now, yesterday the government caught up with Martha. I believe her card was the Queen of Diamonds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Hillary Clinton's book hits the stores this Monday. Oh, boy. It took her a long time to write it. But in her defense, every time she tried to use the desk, you know, Bill was always using it for a date.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, in her new book, Hillary says that for months she accepted Bill Clinton's story that Monica was just an intern who had come to him asking for help in finding a job. And of course he wasted no time in finding a position for her.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Listen to this. Today, they said Monica Lewinsky has decided not to comment on Hillary's book. Great -- now she keeps her mouth shut.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The stock market had a great rally. The Dow broke over 9000. See what happens the minute Bush leaves the country for a few days?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And on his way back home from the Middle East, President Bush had Air Force One fly over Baghdad for an hour. Air Force One, this is true, circled Baghdad. That shows you how desperate Bush is to find weapons of mass destruction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Okay, now, folks, even though Hillary's book comes out on Monday, a lot of quotes have been leaked to the media. What they don't tell you is that a lot of these quotes are often incomplete. They don't give you the whole thing. So I thought I'd read from an advanced copy and give you the complete [context.] ... Here's one here. 'As a wife, I wanted to wring bill's neck. It was the only part of his body that other women weren't wringing.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's the whole one - 'He told me what happened between them had been brief and sporadic. He said, 'Al Gore and I were just experimenting.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, this is an interesting one. 'I could barely speak to Bill. And when I did, it was a tirade. He slept downstairs. I slept upstairs. As opposed to our usual arrangement, where I slept downstairs and he slept upstairs.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is interesting - 'Buddy the Dog came along to keep Bill company. The difference between them -- Buddy was not trained to hump your leg.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's the whole quote - 'I had no idea he was having an affair until two days before he admitted it on television. I also had no idea the world was round, humans breathe oxygen, and where babies come from.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And finally - 'This was the most devastating, shocking and hurtful experience of my life. I vowed never again to let Janet Reno give me a bikini wax.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton, by the way, is -- you know she has written a book with her memoirs, eight years in the White House. 600 page memoir. That's amazing. 600 pages, think about it. Not bad for a woman who when she was there had no idea what was going on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, Martha Stewart issued a statement saying -- this is a quote - 'I am innocent, and I will fight to clear my name.' Yeah, Martha then said, 'I look forward to the day when people stop thinking I'm guilty and get back to thinking I'm cold and arrogant.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, the executive editor of the New York Times resigned due to the recent scandal involving plagiarism and fraud. Yeah. Yeah, today, the Times named a new executive editor, Sammy Sosa.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess Martha was formally charged with making false statements. That's against the law -- unless of course, you're trying to start a war.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To promote her new book, Hillary Clinton has agreed to sit down with an interview with Barbara Walters. They're gonna be -- they did it already, it's gonna be on Sunday. Barbara says she was surprised that Hillary Clinton agreed to the interview, because, you know, Barbara had done the interview with Monica Lewinsky. But Walters says she believes that as far as Hillary's concerned, you know, Monica is behind her. You know, as opposed to Bill, who always felt that Monica was beneath him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Hillary told Barbara Walters that Clinton came to her bedside one morning, woke her up to confess. And she said she was shocked. Not that he'd lied -- that Clinton even knew where her bedroom was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary says that after Clinton admitted to the affair, she yelled at him. She said, 'why did you lie to me?' and he said, 'you mean this time?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary said that after Bill admitted the affair with Monica, he would spend time alone with buddy the dog. He'd spend all his time with buddy the dog. At least, that's how he told her he got those scratches on his back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier in the week, thousands of angry Iraqis marched in the streets, demanding -- demanding that the new Iraqi government be selected by a majority vote of the citizens. Oh, shut up, we don't even do that in this country.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And how about Hillary? Hillary is everywhere. It's unbelievable. Last night she was on Barbara Walters. This morning she was on Katie Couric. Next week she goes on Diane Sawyer. This is the first time Hillary's been on more women than Bill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary said that when she first set eyes on Bill Clinton back in college, he had a beard, and he reminded her of a Viking. Which is perfect, because she reminded him of Iceland.'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And of course, like a Viking, he's still out constantly exploring virgin territories.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary said that one of the reasons she stayed with Bill for so long is that no one can make her laugh the way Bill does. That's what she said. Especially when he says stuff like, 'I did not have sex with that woman...' What's funnier than that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in her new book, which came out today -- you know, people always talk, 'Why did she forgive him?' And all this kind of stuff. Well, Hillary compares her decision to forgive Bill with Nelson Mandela's decision to forgive his jailers. Of course, the big difference is Mandela was innocent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it doesn't end. The A&amp;E network is planning to make a movie about Hillary Clinton. It looks like Sharon Stone is gonna play Hillary. This is true. Sharon Stone -- this is true -- Sharon Stone will play Hillary. Today Vin Diesel was signed to play Janet Reno.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Monica Lewinsky will be played by Louie Anderson.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's supposed to be a very good film. They said there are a lot of very, very touching moments in it -- Bill touching Monica, Bill touching Paula. Bill touching Kathleen Willey. What else?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Japanese ruling council has voted this week to send troops to Iraq. Guys, what's the hurry? Please! You don't wanna rush into this thing!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What are the Japanese gonna do next week? Maybe they could send us some rope to help get Baby Jessica out of the well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And here's a story that was in the LA Times today. It seems the leading executioner in Saudi Arabia -- the guy who actually beheads people with a giant sword. That's what they do -- put your head down and they cut your head off with a sword. It's true. The guy says in the interview today that he likes his job and he has no trouble sleeping at night. Well, see, I'm glad he likes his job. I mean, the minute it stops being fun, that's when you wanna get out. You know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Attorney General John Ashcroft has canceled the annual gay pride award ceremony held every year by the gay Justice Department employees. Ashcroft told them, 'Look, you'll just have to watch the Tonys. Okay? That's it. I'm sorry.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So in other words, the Federal agency that's responsible for enforcing laws that ban discrimination against gay people is now refusing to let them have their annual awards show. To give you an idea how homophobic Ashcroft is, he doesn't even want them using the word 'annual.' Said it sounds dirty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In more serious news, I guess you heard about the disease, monkeypox, that's going around? They say you get it by coming in contact with prairie dogs. Hence, the name.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was such a nice day today, Martha Stewart was doing outsider trading.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's something exciting. You know the Hillary Clinton book, the 600 page memoir about her 8 years in the White House? You think 600 pages for a woman who had no idea what was going on?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, she's kicked off her big 30 city book tour to remind us what a private person she is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But she had a big book signing party today at Barnes and Noble, and listen to this, the first 50 people to show up got to sleep with Bill.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, we are interrupting Hillary's book tour to bring you the Tonight Show. But we will go back to the regularly scheduled Hillary program.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you seen the book? It's huge. 562 pages. Why is it everything the Clintons do is fat? Why is that?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the book, Hillary describes the first time she met Bill as an immediate attraction, right away. Immediate attraction. And Bill knew when he saw Hillary that first time, he knew that this is the woman that he wanted to spend the rest of his life cheating on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary said she met Bill at the Yale library. He was standing in the doorway looking over her, and she got up and walked over to him and said, 'If we're going to keep looking at each other, I might as well introduce myself.' Bill said, 'I was staring at the ass on the blonde behind you.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She said they met at the Yale library, which really surprised President Bush. He said, 'I went to Yale. I didn't know they had a library.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary also says in the book that it was a challenge to forgive Bill, but she figured if Nelson Mandela could forgive, she would, too. Isn't that amazing? I didn't know Clinton hit on Mandela's wife.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary said that during the Lewinsky scandal, a lot of people reached out to her, including the Dalai Lama. Isn't that amazing? The Dalai Lama called her at the White House with some advice. How cool is that? He told her that Bill's ying and yang were out of balance. The Dalai Lama told her Bill was spending too much time on his yang.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary also said that she got advice from Jackie Kennedy. It's amazing stuff. Attractions around charismatic politicians. Jackie told her that Bill, like Jack Kennedy had a personal magnetism that inspired strong feelings. That's the difference. Kennedy attracted good looking women, you see.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sam Waksal, the founder of ImClone, sentenced to seven years in prison. Seven years. White people going jail. What's going on?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sentenced to seven years in jail for being part of the same insider trading thing that Martha Stewart is allegedly involved in. When asked for a comment, Martha went, 'Aah!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's something interesting. Did you know Martha Stewart and her daughter both dated Waksal? So who gets the conjugal visits, see that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Things are not looking good for Martha Stewart. Today, she was caught at the Mexican border sporting an orange beard and $10,000 in cash.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton told Time magazine that she sympathizes with Martha Stewart because she's a friend of theirs. Did you know they were friends? Apparently, Martha would come by the Oval Office once a week to help get the stains out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Crime is down in New York City and it's such a big story it's a huge story. This is how big the story is. The New York Times now is pretending to have three reporters covering it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Hillary Clinton -- this is exciting, Senator from New York used to be, I guess still is married to the former President. How many of you remember Bill and Hillary? She has brand new book out. It's a 608 page memoir of her eight years in the White House. You remember Hillary -- she is the cold, calculating blonde that wasn't fingerprinted yesterday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday at Barnes and Noble, Hillary Clinton had a book signing and a lot of people showed up. 1,200 people showed up. That's amazing to have Hillary sign the book. Statistically speaking, that means one in ten of those people slept with her husband.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to USA Today, former President Clinton has already, already read his wife's new book five times. Already read it five times, yeah. In fact, in fact, the former President has now spent more time in bed with the book than he has with Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody getting ready for Father's Day? Oh, a little hint for President Bush's twin daughters. If you haven't gotten your dad a present yet, I know he'd love it if you could find some weapons of mass destruction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, President Bush insisted he is absolutely convinced that Saddam Hussein had a weapons program. Of course, he was absolutely convinced he won the 2000 election.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, he's lowered his expectations a bit. They're not so much looking for weapons of mass destruction. Now he says he's willing to settle for a bottle of Tylenol that's been tampered with.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And ImClone chief Sam Waskal was sentenced seven years yesterday for insider trading. And, ironically -- this is amazing -- do you know what his prison name is? Martha!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The judge is recommending that Waskal serve his time at Eglin Federal Prison, which is an Air Force base in Florida. I am not making this up. Did you see this the prison on the news tonight? The prison had yoga, tennis -- there are no fences, there are no fences at this prison -- and it has a sunbathing beach. And Waskal is furious his lawyer agreed to 7 years. He wanted 15.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, instead of a warden, they have a concierge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't wanna to say it's a country club prison, but the 'hellhole' is a 520 yard dogleg to the left, basically.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Martha Stewart's lawyers announcing the prosecutors in her case are finding things that are just not there. Sounds like we could use these guys in Iraq. Let's send them over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the New York Post today, former independent counsel Kenneth Starr -- remember the guy that prosecuted the Clintons, went after the Clintons constantly? Well, all is forgiven. He now says he would love to have dinner with Bill and Hillary. I don't think that's gonna happen, huh? Hey, even Bill and Hillary don't have dinner together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A&amp;E is making a movie about Hillary Clinton. It's called 'Ice Age 2,' I believe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary's book is breaking all the sales records. Have you bought it? How many people here have bought it? Have you bought it? I forget, I'm in California. I'm sorry. 'Book?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, of course, this is putting a lot of pressure on Bill. You know, he's writing his memoirs. And this is gonna be hard to top, you know? In fact word is, listen to this, Bill Clinton is getting so desperate, he's actually considering now telling the truth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bill Clinton said he read Hillary's book five times cover to cover. Five times. In fact, he likes the book so much now he's gonna give it to his girlfriends instead of 'Leaves of Grass.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My favorite quote in Hillary's book, and I mentioned this last night, is where she says that, if Nelson Mandela could forgive, well then she could forgive. Oh, that's not gonna work, okay? Like any other wife would remember Nelson Mandela after catching their husband cheating. Let me tell you something. There's a better chance your wife is gonna remember that woman in Texas who ran over her husband with a Mercedes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton told Katie Couric this week that she was first attracted to Bill Clinton's hands. She said she couldn't keep her eyes off his hands. I think -- no, I think most women are like that. Any time Clinton's around, they have to watch his hands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;CNN is reporting that California Governor Gray Davis has the worst approval rating of any governor in 55 years. He is now five points below monkeypox, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You seem like a nice happy friendly crowd, and it really makes me feel good. Especially after the audience we had last night. You know, I don't want to talk about people when they're not here, but, boy oh boy, were they rude. During the show they were listening to Hillary's book on tape.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The crime rate in New York City is so low...seriously, the only people getting ripped off now are the folks buying Hillary's book.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you folks read the new Hillary Clinton book? It's unbelievably successful. They have sold 200,000 copies of this book. That's amazing, isn't it? You know what they're going to do now, they're adding a sex scandal to the new Harry Potter book.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary's book is a big hit, and the way Bill looks at it, it's a win-win situation. Hillary's book being so successful is a win-win for Bill. She's making a lot of money, and she's out on tour doing book signings. You see what I'm saying?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Hillary Clinton's new book passed the latest Harry Potter book to take the number one spot on Barnes and Nobles top 100 list. Yeah. Passed Harry Potter. Yeah. Which just proves that the public can't get enough books about witches.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;ImClone systems founder Sam Waksal was sentenced just yesterday to seven years in jail for insider trading. Seven years in jail, yeah. Yeah. Fortunately, it's a white collar prison, so the worst that could happen is that he'll be gang audited.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bill Clinton said today he has read Hillary's book five times. This guy can't tell the truth to save himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Five times? Five times? Come on. Well, maybe that's true, because he's writing his own book. He has to make sure their stories are straight, you know?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And all week, Hillary Clinton's been saying she has no intention of running for president. See, this is kind of like her version of 'I did not have sexual relations with that woman.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With Hillary's book getting so much attention now, you know who's writing a book? Trent Lott. Trent Lott is writing a book. It just came out. It hits bookstores next week. It's called, 'When Bad Things Happen to White People.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a recent survey, 25% of women believe that Martha Stewart does all her own housework. Martha said today she'd like to find out who these women are and get them on her jury.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, 14 members of the House of Representatives got stuck on an elevator together. The situation ended pretty badly. Yeah -- they got out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We saved a ton of money while they were in there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know whose birthday it is? Former President Bush. It's his birthday today. 79 years old. There you go. Happy birthday, former President Bush. You know, it's gotta be tough, though. It's gotta be tough for George W. to find a present for his dad. I mean, how do you top giving him Iraq?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's a sign that the times have changed in Iraq. Listen to this. Iraq now has its first boy band. I think we stopped the bombing a little too early.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, this is true. Five kids. I think they're called 'Nsheik.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hans Blix says he may write a book about his search for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Well, that should be a fascinating read. 'Day one, didn't find anything. Day two, I'm confused. Day three, there's nothing here!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Woody Allen is appearing in a new French promotional video designed to allure American tourists back to France. Yeah, and what says France more than Woody Allen?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the French wanted to use Woody Allen, 'cause he's the one guy on the planet who doesn't frighten them, basically. And of course, Woody Allen likes France because over there, you know, you can give kids wine, so...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The A&amp;E network announced they're making a two hour movie about Hillary Clinton's days in the White House. And of course they haven't come up with a title yet. These are some of the titles they're considering for the Hillary Clinton movie. I like this one. 'She's 2 fat, I'm 2 Furious.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not a bad one either. 'Dude, Where's My Husband?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They thought this might get some of the young people - 'Ken Starr Wars.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not a bad one either - 'Bend It Like Monica.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some of the executives like - 'Crouching Intern, Hidden Cigar.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think this is the one they're gonna go with - 'My Husband Spent Hanukkah in Monica.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many have read the Hillary Clinton book? It's a very popular book, you know, 200,000 copies. And extra popular with women. Women seem to love to buy this book. As a matter of fact even Winona Ryder paid for it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Couple of days ago, here in New York City, Hillary Clinton had a book signing and 1,200 people showed up. She signed so many copies of book that she had a blister on her right hand, and it was so bad that the next night, she had to slap Bill with her left.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Doctors told Hillary to soak it in warm water, bandage it and rest it for a week. No wait a minute, that's what they told Bill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been reported that five young men in Baghdad have started a boy band modeled after 'Nsync and the Backstreet Boys. In Baghdad. Yeah, folks, if this is true, it means that the Iraqis may finally have acquired a weapon of mass destruction.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy Friday the 13th. Are you scared that it's Friday the 13th? Hey, let me -- hey, between SARS, monkeypox, mad cow disease, terrorism, what more bad luck could we have? Bring it on!&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, if you're looking for a last minute Father's Day gift for President Bush, can't go wrong with some scooter riding lessons.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if you guys knew this. President Bush was up at his parents' place in Maine, fell off one of those Segway scooter things. Could have been worse. Could have fallen off the wagon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you ever seen -- have you seen those Segways? They're built for balance. You balance yourself. That's how they go. They automatically balance. The problem is, Bush leaned so far to the right, just, you know, boom, just went down. Just couldn't stay on it. That's the problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, that's the first time Bush has tripped over something that wasn't a three syllable word, so I don't know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, I don't want to pick on the guy. But, you know, let me tell you something. Any guy that chokes on a pretzel should not be allowed on a Segway scooter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For Father's Day, Attorney General John Ashcroft's children got him something he had never seen before -- a copy of the United States Constitution. Beautiful thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For Father's Day, President Bush went fishing with his dad. Unfortunately, he didn't find one single weapon of mass destruction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if you saw this on Friday, while President Bush was at his parents' house up in Kennebunkport, Maine, he slipped and fell off his Segway Scooter. President riding a little Segway Scooter, and the Secret Service, boy, they're taking it pretty seriously. In fact, workers at the house spent the entire weekend childproofing the place, you know, just to make sure there's no problems.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, the Secret Service, they took the President aside and said, 'Whatever you do, don't eat pretzels and try to ride your scooter at the same time.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to USA Today, the war in Iraq cost less than originally expected. The war cost each American $220. Which, ironically, was the price of a tank of gas before the war started.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Fox News is reporting today Al Qaeda is recruiting people from Pakistan to come over here and derail our trains. Is that necessary? Amtrak is doing a hell of a job on their own.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Civilians in Iraq are now refusing to comply with the new law that requires them to turn in all their weapons. The government wants the Iraqi people to turn in their guns and the people won't do it. Well, we wanted them to have an American style democracy. Sounds like they got it, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Hillary Clinton has called for an independent investigation of the intelligence used to justify the war in Iraq. Let me tell you something. If somebody was lying, who better to get the bottom of it than Hillary Clinton?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Boy, I'm driving to work today, saw something strange. I see this guy with a sign, 'The End Is Near.' You know, I'm thinking it was some religious nut, no, it turned out to be Governor Gray Davis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this is pretty amazing. A Republican-led campaign to recall California Governor Gray Davis. This was thought, oh, improbable, never happen. Well, now, it looks like it's gonna happen. It's gonna be on the ballot. It shouldn't be surprising. If there's one thing the Republicans are good at, it's overriding the popular vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Center for Disease Control has confirmed 81 cases of monkeypox in the United States. You know, this is frightening, what's going on. I mean, mad cow disease is on the rise. This monkeypox thing, we got that. And they say this will be the worst summer ever for the West Nile virus. The nightly news is starting to look like 'When Animals Attack,' now, pretty much.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new Harry Potter book is coming out this week. Here's the amazing thing -- even though it's 800 pages, it still has less hocus pocus in it than Hillary Clinton's book. That's amazing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The hit film 'The Matrix,&quot;The Matrix Reloaded,' banned, banned in Egypt because it is too violent. You don't want to introduce violence to the Middle East. Don't want to get these people riled up over there, whatever you do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new movie winning all the film festival awards around the country is this film 'Whale Rider.' Did you hear of this? 'Whale Rider.' Wasn't that Clinton's Secret Service code name?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you had told me three and a half years ago that Hillary Clinton would be back on this show, I would have said, we'll be on the air in three and a half years? Really? Really? That's possible?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to reports now, have you heard this? Osama bin Laden, these are the reports we know about Osama bin Laden, this what is they say, he's broke, Osama bin Laden is broke, he's angry, that's right, and he's planning his revenge. Now, oh, wait a minute, I'm sorry, that's what they're saying about Martha Stewart.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can't believe this story. In Phoenix, Arizona, the Bishop of the Catholic Church there was arrested for hit and run. Guy was killed, hit and run, took off. But the good news for the church, at least he wasn't on a date.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He ran the guy over and took off! He took off! I mean, if you were the Bishop, wouldn't you be worried that someone might have witnessed this? Like maybe, God?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Paleontologists in Africa have unearthed three human skulls believed to be over 160,000 years old. And right next to the ancient skulls they found sharp objects that may have been crude weapons. They found weapons. Today Bush said, 'See, I knew we'd find weapons. We just have to keep looking!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The stock market is continuing to do well. President Bush is hoping this boost in people's 401(k)s will enable some people to retire early -- you know, like Supreme Court justices.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And God bless her, Hillary Clinton's book still on top of the best seller list. In fact, it is doing so well Al Gore has now written a book. It's called, 'Hey, I Didn't Know He Was Cheatin' Either.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I tell you, this Hillary, she is nothing, if not clever. She is one of the smartest women. Did you see what she did? She has a new cover for her book and a new title to appeal to the kids. See. It's called 'Hillary Clinton and the Trousers of Fire.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott says he's planning to write a book. Lott says he'll probably use a ghost writer. Well, not a real ghost, just some guy wearing a white sheet. You know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I drive to work, this is all they talk about on talk radio. Should Martha Stewart go to jail? See, I don't know. If she goes to jail, she's gonna be hanging out with CEOs all day. And then she'll get more insider information. You see?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to the FBI -- this came out just today -- crime rates have dropped. Crime rates dropped last year, though there were increases in murder, rape, and burglary. What else is there?!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, an embarrassing moment today for California Governor Gray Davis. He went to the supermarket right over here. He was flattered when someone out front asked for his autograph, signed it and then realized it was a 'Recall Davis' petition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's some good news. The infamous Hatfield and McCoy feud has finally come to an end. Do you know about -- have you heard about the Hatfield and McCoys? Been fighting for, what, 150 years? Well, descendants of both families got together and signed a truce in Pineville, Kentucky, over the weekend. If you're not familiar with the Hatfield and McCoys, they're kind of like the Israelis and the Palestinians, but with less teeth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sen. Hillary Clinton's new book &quot;is a bona fide blockbuster. It's sold so many copies. Hillary is making so much money on this book, her husband is actually sleeping with her again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was last night when she was on the program, she comes with a lot of security, Secret Service, security. When I came into the theater, I was searched, honest to God, I was frisked, I was patted down and kind of roughly groped. I'm telling you, it was like being a Clinton intern.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top Ten Things Going Through Bush's Mind At This Moment [As He Fall Off Of A Segway Scooter]: 10. Damn you, Al Qaeda! 9. I'm sure Thomas Jefferson fell off his Segway every now and then. 8. It looked so easy on the Jetsons. 7. I misunderestimated my center of gravity. 6. Thank God no one got a picture of this. 5. Only 4 days 'til Hulk! Only 4 days 'til Hulk! Only 4 days 'til Hulk! 4. Damn, this would give Cheney, like, 3 heart attacks. 3. Congratulations, Segway - you just joined the axis of evil! 2.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Saddam Hussein's daughter told reporters that her father is still alive. Yeah, her exact quote was, 'Somebody returned that tie I bought for Father's Day.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The owner of a major New York bookstore says that copies of Senator Hillary Clinton's new book are 'flying off the shelves.' They said that, yeah. Yeah, mainly because she's been throwing them at her husband.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Frank Keating, the former Governor of Oklahoma, caused a huge controversy this week by comparing the Catholic Church to the Mafia. Yeah, experts say if Keating isn't careful, he could end up sleeping with the loaves and the fishes.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Wolf Blitzer has kind of a problem. He's got a show on CNN called, 'Showdown Iraq.' But now that the war is over, they need a new name.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;British scientists say they're working on a smart airline seat. It's a seat that can spot nervous terrorists.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to the New York Post, Bill Clinton is writing a cookbook. This is true. Did you see this? Writing a cookbook. Well, finally a Clinton book Monica will read.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's pretty amazing, isn't it? Who would've thought a year ago Bill Clinton would be writing a cookbook, and Martha Stewart would be indicted?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do we have an advanced copy of Bill Clinton's cookbook? Oh, here it is here. It's called 'Eat Me.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York City &quot;is safer now. Listen to this statistic. So far this year we've on had 254 murders. Murder, don't kid yourself, that's a low number for New York City, it's way, way down, and it's down because of Mayor Bloomberg with that $50 fine for murder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;George W. Bush is having fundraising dinners, had one the other night and they served, for $2,000, you either got a hot dog or you got a hamburger. George W.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the Census Bureau, Hispanics now outnumber African Americans in the US. There are more Hispanics than African Americans. Today Jesse Jackson said, 'Hey, don't blame me. I've been doing my share. Hey, it's not my fault.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A couple days ago President Bush there in Washington, they cleared off the lawn at the White House and they had a big barbecue for about 1,000 lawmakers and their wives and husbands and families and stuff. A big barbecue for 1,000 people. That's a big task. That's enormous. The contract, of course, went to Halliburton.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a recent interview, Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling said that she sobbed uncontrollably when one of the characters in her new book died. Yeah.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Bush said that when it comes to choosing the next Supreme Court justice, he has no intention of including Democrats in the decision. That's what he said. Yeah, meanwhile, Dick Cheney said that when it comes to choosing the next Supreme Court justice, he has no intention of including President Bush in the decision.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you. What a crowd. Man, you sound like Colin Ferrell and Bill Clinton when they heard lap dancing was still legal in LA, yeah!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love this story. Only in Los Angeles. After hours, after hours of testimony from strippers and lap dancers, the LA City Council has postponed a vote on a ban on lap dancing. Listen to this -- they postponed it -- and this is a quote - 'so they can study the issue further.' Oh, shut up. The state is broke. We have no electricity. We're running out of water. 'Let's study the lap dancing issue just a little bit more.' How stupid.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and this summer, experts are predicting an extreme fire danger here in southern California. Meanwhile, up in northern California, Gray Davis in extreme danger of being fired. So it's tough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And at a $2,000 a plate fundraising dinner for President Bush the other night, Republicans dined on nachos and hot dogs. And at the event, President Bush said the economy is turning the corner. Well, of course he thinks the economy is turning the corner, he's surrounded by people who can afford to pay $2,000 for nachos and hot dogs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The leaders of 15 European nations will meet next week to discuss ways to improve relationships, or relations, rather, with the United State. They want to tell the American people about the European brand of democracy. You know, that's when you sit on your ass, let the Americans bail you out whenever there's trouble.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Al Gore, reportedly trying to develop his own TV network. Boy, that's sad, when the only way you can get on TV is to have your own network. Boy, that's not a good sign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Maybe he can start his own country where he can be president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some bad news for presidential candidate Howard Dean. You know Howard Dean, the Democrat, running for president? ... Well, his 17- year-old son was cited today by police for trying to steal alcohol. Stealing alcohol. Even worse, he was stealing it from the Bush twins. Yeah, that was the bad part.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the New York Post, Bill Clinton is putting out his own cookbook. Isn't that amazing?

That's one of the recipes&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This weekend, if you were at a bookstore, you really only had two choices -- you read about the Harry Potter tale, or read about the Bill Clinton tail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Harry Potter author, J.K. Rowling, said -- said she cried. She said she cried when she killed off one of the characters in her book. And today, Hillary Clinton said, 'You can do that? You can kill them off?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess she's got another one coming out. This one comes out next month, I guess. This is kind of a revised American version: 'Harry Potter and the Bishop of Phoenix.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush, suffering from a leg injury. Hurt his foot, actually, forcing him to cut back on his jogging. I guess what happened was at a big fundraiser the other night, his foot got run over by a wheelbarrow full of cash.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Al Gore, God bless him, trying to start his own television network. Will be available all over the country except, of course, Florida.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been nothing but disasters in the news. Florida has these horrible floods. Arizona has wildfires. California has Governor Gray Davis. It's just awful. It's just awful no matter where you go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you heard this. Governor Gray Davis, in a bid to become even more unpopular, has now tripled the cost of car registration. LA drivers were shocked. They said, 'Registration? What's that?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congratulations to our good friend, Geraldo Rivera, he's getting engaged, getting married. He gave his fiancee, Erica Levy, a six carat diamond ring. Yeah. The bad news, today the Iraqi National Museum said, 'We want it back.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you been following the story about Saddam Hussein? First of all they think he's dead. Then they think that he's not dead, then over the weekend they said no, no he's dead and we're checking for DNA. Now the New York Times says, well, no, he's not dead. And I'm just thinking, 'Well, gosh, I hope he's not dead, because he's supposed to be here guest hosting on Friday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you know this? President Bush is like two blocks away in town? He's here on a big fundraiser, and I'll tell you, President Bush loves New York City because it's a lot easier, a lot easier to find weapons of mass destruction in New York City. That ain't a problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I didn't realize, President Bush apparently injured his leg? He pulled a muscle in his leg, did you know about that? I didn't know anything about it. Yeah. He's got like a bad leg, he pulled a muscle in his leg. And it's the first time Bush has pulled a leg since that story about Iraq having weapons of mass destruction.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US is now looking at a possibility that an Iraqi convoy that was destroyed near the Syrian border the other day may have contained Saddam Hussein. And if this true, this marks the 23rd time we have killed Saddam Hussein since the war began. Yeah!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We killed this guy more times than Kenny in 'South Park.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They said on the news that the convoy was traveling along a known smuggling route. Now, maybe I'm wrong here, but if you're a smuggler and your route is already known, aren't you pretty much defeating the purpose really?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush met with the Pakistani President Pervez -- Pervez -- I hope I say his name right -- Musharraf today at Camp David. Although one embarrassing moment. You know how Bush likes to give people nicknames. He said, 'Hey, can I call you 'Perv'?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Bush criticized European governments for refusing to accept American bio-engineered food. He said the decision is not based on fact. And if there's one thing President Bush cannot stand, it's countries making important decisions that aren't base on facts!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night in New York, President Bush raised a record $4 million in one night at a fundraising dinner. That's the most money a presidential candidate has picked up at one dinner, well, since John Kerry proposed to Terersa Heinz.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the 17-year-old son of presidential candidate Howard Dean arrested -- arrested for stealing a dozen cases of beer from a Vermont country club. And as a Democrat, you think Dean would've taught his children, there are legal ways to steal from the rich. You don't have to rob country clubs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congressional Republicans very upset that Federal funds are being used to pay for a conference on sexual arousal next month at the Kinsey Institute. Oh, yeah. Federal money. Republicans say taxpayers' money shouldn't be used to investigate sexual arousal -- unless, of course, you're trying impeach a [Democratic president].&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the LA Daily News, California students rank just about dead last -- I think we're tied with Mississippi, tied with Mississippi, in national reading test scores. We are the lowest. Isn't that amazing? And you know who's thrilled about this? Governor Gray Davis. He's actually happy. He's saying, 'Great, people can't read the recall notice now.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On CNN yesterday, Governor Davis said he will not resign, he will not step down. Well, of course not. With the California economy, he's not gonna find another job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since California's $38 billion in debt, Governor Davis has tripled the vehicle license fee. But that's only gonna raise $4 billion. You know, if he wants to solve the $38 billion deficit, don't tax cars. Tax marijuana and botox. That's where the money is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Supreme Court ruled yesterday public libraries can be forced to install anti-pornography filters on all their computers. And some libraries are even going too far. Like, in Utah, they removed the 'T' and 'A' keys from the keyboard. That's how bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, some gossip. According to the New York Daily News, last week, Bill Clinton was spotted talking to Kim Cattrall. How about that, huh? The star of 'Sex and the City' getting together with Kim Cattrall.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The CIA is using the DNA testing to determine if Saddam Hussein is dead or alive. Yeah. Coincidentally it's the same method the Democrats used on Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apparently the US military obtained samples of Saddam Hussein DNA from a Ba'ath Party intern.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;George W. Bush, our President was in town. $2,000 a plate fundraiser. $2,000 a plate, or as tourists call it, room service.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He comes in at 5:00, and at the fundraiser, George W. Bush spoke for 25 minutes and that was just trying to pronounce the menu.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the Bush fundraiser was $2,000 a head, making it the most expensive head that did not cause an impeachment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top 10 Signs That You Are In Love With Democratic Presidential Candidate Howard Dean: 10. You've actually heard of him. 9. Whenever he discusses plan to revitalize economy, you get goosebumps. 8. You named your cats 'Howard,&quot;Dean,' and 'Six-Term Governor Howard Dean.' 7. You'll only watch movies featuring Ron Howard or Harry Dean Stanton. 6. When you hear a report on the radio about a highway accident, you murmur, 'Please God, don't let Howard Dean be involved.' 5. Constantly complain rival candidate Dennis Kucinich isn't 'Howardly' enough. 4. Changed outfit four times before watching appearance on 'Meet the Press.' 3. You stand by him despite the fact his infidelities embarrassed you in front of the entire..oh, wait a minute, wrong Democrat. 2. When he announced his candidacy, you didn't laugh your ass off. 1. You're actually considering wasting a vote on him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night in Manhattan, President Bush attended a fundraiser, and the crowd began yelling, 'Four More Years.' That's right. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, apparently -- apparently, the crowd was guessing how much longer we'll be looking for weapons of mass destruction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barbra Streisand has a new message on her Website that urges blacks and Jews to unite and defeat President Bush. That's right. Yeah, true story. Yeah, the message probably won't have much of an effect because no black person has ever logged on to Streisand's Website.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You may have heard this. President Bush announced today we have found the weapons of mass destruction. They were in Snoop Dogg's car last night at the BET awards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you may have heard, yesterday, US forces think they may have killed Saddam Hussein in a convoy when it was on its way to Syria. See, let me tell you how it works. See, US troops now get a card and they punch it each time they kill Saddam. You see? And every tenth kill, they get a weekend off.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, President Bush said that Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden will both be captured. It's just matter of time -- as long as that time is sometime before election day. That's pretty much the time we're on here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush hailed the Supreme Court's call for diversity on campuses. He thought this was good. Bush said college admission shouldn't depend on race, creed or color -- it should depend on who your father is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me explain. He said Ivy League schools should be a place where the wealthiest 1% can mingle freely with the upper 10%.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Bill Clinton lashing out against President Bush. He was mad today. Former president Bill Clinton said the Bush Administration is erasing his accomplishments. So I guess they're finally cleaning the carpet in the Oval Office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush is breaking all records raising money at these political dinners. And the Democrats are all upset. But, you know, Clinton used to raise millions, too. They all do it. This is not unusual. And besides dinners, they also get extra donations when they pose for photos. You know, these fat cats come up, you get a picture taken with the President. It's like $10,000. And back in California, Governor Gray Davis does something similar. He takes a picture of you with him, and then threatens to show it to people unless you give him $5,000.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, Davis' approval rating now fallen to 21%, and that's just a survey of his immediate family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a study in USA Today -- and this is hard to believe -- California ranks last in managing its money. We're last. We're right below M.C. Hammer. Do you believe that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Sharpton failed to show up at his own press conference the other day to announce his news of -- he didn't show up. Well, it's not his fault. It was New York. He couldn't get a cab. Come on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night on the show we had Vitali Klitschko. Is that how you say his name? The guy that -- he's got a Ph.D., did you know that? Yeah, he's like the smartest fighter. He's got his Ph.D. He's the guy that fought Lennox Lewis the other night -- he got beat up. In fact, at one point, he was ahead on points, when officials stopped the fight. He was ahead, and they stopped the fight. He was furious, and today, Al Gore said, 'Huh, tell me about it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You folks remember Iraqi's information minister, Baghdad Bob? You remember him. Well, they have arrested this guy now and he is in custody and he was asked for a comment. He said, 'I'm not arrested. I'm in Miami Beach on vacation.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But according to reports Iraqis are afraid that Saddam Hussein is alive and may come back to power. Coincidently, that's the same fear the Democrats have about Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top Ten Things The Iraqi Information Minister Has Admitted Since Being Captured: 10. Okay, Iraq didn't win the war. It was a tie. 9.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In what's being called a landmark decision, the Supreme Court legalized sodomy in Texas. So by overturning the law, people in Texas can now overturn each other.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what Bush should do? Refinance the deficit while the rates are low. He'd probably get 1% for 30 years.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They say over in France, the wine region over there now going through an incredible heat wave, destroying all the crops. The crops are ruined and this has devastated the French economy, proving once again, prayer works.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The two best selling books right now are the new Harry Potter book and Hillary Clinton's memoir's about life in the White House. One is a complete book of fiction, the other, of course, a children's book.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here is good news out of Iraq, the Iraqi minister of information. Do you remember this guy during the war? Baghdad Bob, this was the guy.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new poll, voters in the US would be reluctant to give President Bush a second term. Isn't that kind of a prize? Strictly speaking we really didn't give him a first term.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Secret Service refused to let Microsoft's Bill Gates into the White House because he didn't have any ID on him. Turned Bill Gates away, yeah.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Department of Transportation is now testing a controversial new passenger-screening technology that sees right through clothing. Critics say this machine violates passenger's privacy, and the screeners will basically be allowed to look at a parade of naked women. If that keeps them awake, fine with me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oregon's medical marijuana program is lowering the fees it charges people because they have a $300,000 surplus. What a shock - the first time a government has ever made money at anything and it's selling drugs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the 4th of July, Arnold Schwarzenegger who was here last night, is traveling to Iraq to screen his movie for US troops. Also during that week Justin and Kelly will be screening their movie for the prisoners on Guantanamo Bay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, the Supreme Court ruled that sex between two men is in fact legal. That's what they decided, yes. That's right. It is, in fact, legal. Not only that, the Supreme Court also ruled that sex between two women is very exciting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was reported yesterday that the US has arrested the former Iraqi Minister of Information. Remember that guy? They arrested him.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you heard that story. That's the big story back east, the marriage between Mario Cuomo's son Andrew and Bobby Kennedy's daughter Kerry. They have broken up. Yeah. Isn't that amazing, huh? I guess he caught her in bed with a family friend. Did you read this story? A Kennedy having an affair. You could have knocked me over -- just out of nowhere!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The CIA now saying that an audiotape supposedly made by Saddam Hussein is probably really him.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Things not looking good here in California. Unemployment, nine year high. 6.4%. In fact, the way this recall thing is going, unemployment will get a little higher real soon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Proponents of this election to recall Governor Gray Davis claim they now have 988,000 signatures. Isn't that amazing? I didn't realize that many Californians spoke English.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Boston Globe is reporting that Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry used to date actress Morgan Fairchild. But it didn't work out. Apparently she couldn't handle dating someone with bigger hair than she had.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist announced he supports a constitutional amendment banning gay marriages. He says if a gay man wants to marry in this country, he'll just have to wait in line for Liza Minelli like everybody else.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And happy birthday to President Bush, turned 57 years old. If you haven't gotten him a gift yet, you can't go wrong with an economic plan. Doesn't have one of those.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love this story. The White House said today there were plans for a surprise party, they're gonna have a surprise party to celebrate President Bush's birthday party. But they canceled it when word leaked out. Word leaked out? It's the White House. Isn't that supposed to be the most secret?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, it's unbelievable. I mean, we can't find weapons of mass destruction, we can't find Osama bin Laden, we can't find Saddam Hussein. We can't even find the plot in the new Charlie's Angels movie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're now saying if Terminator 3 reaches $200 million at the box office, Arnold Schwarzenegger will not run for governor if it makes $200 million bucks. And so far, Gray Davis has seen it 380 times.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess he caught them in the act, walked in on them while they were in bed together. Whew, yeah. He confronted her. He said, 'What are you doing?' She said, 'Being Kennedy-esque.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you heard by now, the Supreme Court has struck down the ban on gay sex. It's now legal to have gay sex. You cannot be arrested. You can still be handcuffed, but you can't be -- you can't be arrested.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Experts say it's very unlikely the Bush Administration will commit a large number of troops to Liberia. They say the country's way too small to distract the American public from the economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;California Governor Gray Davis visited an elementary school here in Los Angeles where he taught a class. I don't want to say it was unpopular, but the kids gave him a wedgie and stuffed him in a locker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to today's Los Angeles Times, Gray Davis now gets negative job ratings from white people, black people, Latinos, Republicans, independents, even Democrats.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been reported that the uniforms designed for Iraq's new police force include belts made by Calvin Klein. The belts are made by Calvin Klein, yeah.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a speech today, President Bush said he is considering sending US troops to Liberia. That's right, yeah. Yeah, the President went on to say he won't make his decision until he finds out if it's a real place.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Bush met with the president of South Africa to discuss how to deal with Zimbabwe, which has been called a threat to stability in the area.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former presidential candidate Steve Forbes, who attacked President Bush during the 2000 campaign, now says he was wrong.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House finally admitted this week that the intelligence President Bush got for his State of the Union address was faulty. All that stuff about, you know, trying to find nuclear material -- faulty. People are, 'Oh, well, hey, it's not like we went to war over it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Bill Frist trying to get a constitutional amendment passed banning gay marriage. Do we really need this? You know, I look at the papers today, Sharon Stone and her husband are getting a divorce. Andrew Cuomo, Kerry Kennedy, they're getting a divorce. Nicolas Cage, Lisa Marie Presley, they just got a divorce. You know, forget banning gay marriages. We should ban celebrity marriages, okay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A man in Arkansas woke up from a 19 year coma yesterday and started talking. He was in a coma for 19 years. He still thinks it's 1984, which in Arkansas is pretty close.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, they said today the only other person in Arkansas that didn't know what was happening for 19 years was, of course, Hillary Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush having all kinds of adventures in Africa. You heard about this? True story -- earlier today, President Bush visited an animal refuge in Africa, and he came across a wild pack of elephants. True story, saw a bunch of wild -- yeah, he was walking along and he saw a wild pack of elephants. Apparently, there was one awkward moment when President Bush and one of the elephants pointed at each other and said, 'Look, there's Dumbo.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Boy, I don't know how this happened. Heads are gonna roll for this. This is unbelievable. I don't know if you heard about this. Today in Africa, the Secret Service arrested a guy who made it onto the White House press plane, traveling with President Bush. The guy just sneaks on the plane. No credentials! They think it might have been Geraldo.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The guy didn't even have a pass, but he gets on the President's plane. I mean, grandmothers go from LA to Phoenix on Southwest, they get strip searched for traveling with a key chain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This guy, I mean, no pass. Isn't that the plot of 'Air Force One?' Isn't that what that movie was about?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually the way he got on, there was an empty seat belonging to the New York Times reporter, who was pretending to be on the flight. You know, he was -- he was writing the story.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They think this may have been the same guy who told Bush back in January that Iraq was planning to buy uranium.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you heard, President Bush now taking a lot of heat for using bogus intelligence to justify invading Iraq. 'Bogus intelligence.' Wasn't that Bush's nickname at Yale?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Senegal, President Bush called slavery one of the greatest crimes in history -- you know, right after stealing the election.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Jerry Springer has filed papers to run for the United States Senate. He said -- he said he wants to attract people who don't normally vote -- or read. Or bathe, or brush their tooth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's an amazing story. How about this guy in Arkansas? You hear about this guy? 19 years in a coma before he finally regained consciousness. 19 years in a coma. So you see, there's still hope for Al Gore. There's still a chance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And here's a nightmare story. Boy, how'd you like to have this happen to you. In Germany, an oil delivery guy -- you know, delivering oil to the house -- accidentally ruined a home when he pumped 800 gallons of oil into this guy's house. 800 -- 800 gallons. That's enough to give Bush an excuse to invade.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess the big story, I guess you heard about this, looks like there was more false information in President Bush's State of the Union address. Yeah. Now, it turns out he really didn't have an economic plan either.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, all the TV news shows are full of Democrats all furious, criticizing President Bush for the State of the Union address. They say he exaggerated some of the facts. See, that's something Bill Clinton never did. No, no, Clinton never stretched the truth. In fact, Clinton, he never even came close to the truth. You see what I'm saying?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush is making amends. He says he's going to do better. Says the next State of the Union address will begin with, 'My fellow Americans, I'm just kidding about last year. I didn't know what the hell I wanted. I must have been drinking or something.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's a scary story. I'm sure you all heard about this. Late last week while he was in Africa, the Secret Service arrested a man who made it onto President Bush's press plane. You hear about this guy? Guy had no press credentials of any kind yet he got on the plane and he was on the plane before he got discovered. He had no press credentials at all. So apparently, they're thinking he might have worked for Fox News.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of Fox News, our good friend Geraldo Rivera, you know, got married. He and his wife will honeymoon in the south of France. France, of course, great country for Geraldo. No military secrets to give away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, British Prime Minister Tony Blair announced he will fly to the US this week to meet with President Bush. This way they can get their stories straight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The leader of Iran has offered to resign because so many citizens are angry with his government. He told the people, he said, 'If you don't want me, then I will just go.' And today, Governor Gray Davis said, 'Hey, shut up. Shut up. Quit saying that.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about Jerry Springer? He announced in Ohio, he's going to run for senator. Jerry Springer running for senator. Just hope there's nothing sleazy in his background.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, as you know, the Supreme Court made sodomy legal. Jerry will make it mandatory.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A man in Arkansas has been in a coma for 19 years. And he finally woke up. Isn't that amazing? He's out cold for 19 years, and now he's back conscious and alive. And they are being very, very cautious with him. Right now they are slowly talking him through the Clinton Administration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House is saying that the part about purchasing uranium, Iraq buying the uranium, that should never have been in the State of the Union speech and Bush is very angry about it. It's a huge embarrassment. You know how many hours it took Bush to learn how to pronounce uranium? That's what he's upset about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, President and Mrs. Bush were traveling in Africa, and while they were there they saw two elephants mating.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and before we go any further, I wanted you to know, everything I am saying in tonight's monologue has been approved by CIA Director George Tenet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you may have heard, George Tenet has taken the blame for the false information in President Bush's State of the Union address. Now if Bush can just find somebody to take the blame for the economy, he's home free.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republicans in Congress are defending President Bush, saying he had no idea that the statement in the State of the Union address was wrong. He had no idea. Well, times have changed, haven't they? Remember when the President used to be embarrassed to tell people he didn't write his own speech? Now it's like a badge of honor.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But even though a mistake was made, Bush said today he stands behind George Tenet -- which is usually where you stand when you're about to push somebody off the side.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, good news. The Bush Administration finally uncovered some weapons of mass destruction. The bad news, they're in North Korea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Okay, follow me here. Today, North Korea told the US it had processed nuclear fuel rods into weapons grade plutonium. They have weapons grade plutonium, but we don't believe them. We don't believe they have it. I don't get this. Iraq said we don't have any weapons of mass destruction. Oh, yeah? We invade. North Korea says we've got them. 'Ha, ha, they're lying. Do not. Shut up.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and the new Iraqi political council met for the very first time. And as their first act, they declared April 9th, the day Baghdad fell to US forces, a national holiday. That's typical government work there. First day on the job, what do they do? 'Hey, let's take the day off, make a holiday. Yeah, come on!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, told a Senate panel that the cost of propping up Iraq would hit $4 billion a month. $4 billion a month. Did I say Iraq? I'm sorry, I meant California.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Looks like Jerry Springer is gonna run for the US Senate from Ohio. The people of Ohio couldn't be prouder. Do you realize if Springer does leave his TV talk show to go to the Senate, he will actually improve the morals of both places.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What kind of people are gonna vote for Jerry Springer? I mean, you thought those voters in Florida had trouble figuring out their ballots, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pat Robertson has urged his audience to pray -- to pray -- for God to remove three Supreme Court justices from the Supreme Court so they could be replaced by conservatives. He said one is 83 years olds, one has cancer, one has a heart condition. What is Pat Robertson, a mob boss now? 'Yeah, Heavenly Father, could you please take out these three people? That would be a shame if they were to have an accident.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was thinking about this, the country right now is at war. Our economy is bad. $455 billion deficit, and Democrats are saying, 'How are we going to beat this guy?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of Presidents, up in Chappaqua, where former President Clinton lives, there's a thrift store. He is selling his old clothing. You can go in the thrift store and buy old Bill Clinton clothes, or as it used to be known, evidence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;North Korea announced that they are close to developing nuclear weapons. Yeah, after hearing about it, President Bush said, 'Man, we getter get Hawkeye and Colonel Potter out of there.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, controversial talk show host Jerry Springer launched a run for the US Senate. Running for Senate, yeah. Running for Senate, yeah. Yeah, Springer said he wants to give a voice to the little people, and he means actual little people.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You heard about this thing, 'Hunting for Bambi? Hear about this? Guys in Vegas, they pay thousands of dollars to go out in the desert and shoot naked women with paintballs. ... But I guess there are some restrictions. Men are not allowed to shoot the women up close or above the chest. Just between here and here. You know, the same rules Clinton had to follow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the deficit is now 50% bigger than the White House predicted just five months ago. And Bush is blaming the whole thing on his economic adviser, Miss Cleo.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;CIA Director George Tenet's got problems. It seems more evidence of faulty intelligence has surfaced. Turns out he's the one who told Bush last year that those pretzels he choked on were safe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I love how the Democrats are all crying about being misled by Bush's State of the Union. You know, you watch these nine candidates, they're all saying, 'Bush is dumb, Bush is a moron, Bush is a pinhead, Bush is unqualified.' Now they're going, 'Hey, he tricked us.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now the Democrats in Congress are calling for an investigation of Bush's statements in the State of the Union address. However, the White House press secretary has said, 'The President has moved on.' That's what he said. 'The President has moved on.' See, that's the difference between politics and real life. Don't you wish you could do that in your job, you know? When your boss goes, 'Hey, Johnson, these reports you turned in are a mess!&quot;Look, boss, I've moved on. I'm sorry.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's see what's new with Pat 'The Enforcer' Robertson. Have you heard the latest on him? Religious leader Pat Robertson has launched what he calls a 'prayer offensive' calling for God to remove Supreme Court judges that he does not like. Amazing. He mentioned that one is 83, one has cancer, one has a heart condition. This is his prayer -- that's not a prayer offensive. That is an offensive prayer. Isn't it? Am I wrong?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His exact words were, 'We ask for miracles in regards to the Supreme Court.' What? Miracles? They got George Bush elected as President. Miracles don't come any bigger than that. Come on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now it looks like North Korea has nuclear weapons. Pakistan has nuclear weapons. India has nuclear weapons. Now they're saying Syria has nuclear weapons. Turns out every country in the world has weapons of mass destruction except Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a new book out now that lists all of the countries that hate or resent the US. It's called the world atlas, I believe.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Democratic candidate Dick Gephardt fell short of his fundraising goal by $1 million. His goal was to try and raise $1 million. Not a lot of excitement there.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House is blaming the CIA for the faux pas in the State of the Union speech. You know what they're talking about? George Bush in the State of the Union speech said that Iraq is trying to buy uranium from Africa, and now the CIA is saying we said that wasn't the case, and the White House said that wasn't the case. Sounds to me like something got punked.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, President Clinton and his wife, Valerie -- Hillary -- live up the road in Chappaqua, and somehow a thrift store is selling all of Bill Clinton's old clothing. And I guess how this works is you get tired of wearing your clothes and you take them to the thrift store, so now you can go up to Chappaqua and buy old Bill Clinton clothing. And I'm thinking, man, this is quite an opportunity, now can you get into his pants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government announced that this year's budget deficit is gonna be $455 billion -- that's the largest ever. $455 billion. The biggest ever.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a conference yesterday, several Democratic presidential candidates said they would appoint a gay man to the Supreme Court. That's what they said. Yeah.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush still getting flak over his misstatements in his State of the Union address. They're now saying the faulty information allegedly came from British intelligence -- British. See, this is what I've been saying to you. British intelligence hasn't been the same since Sean Connery stopped being 007.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush is fighting back. He said -- this is what he said. He said, 'The intelligence I get is darned good intelligence.' That's what he said, 'Darned good.' He actually said that. See, no matter how important an issue is, Bush always makes it sound like he's in a commercial for barbecue sauce.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Supporters of Governor Gray Davis are fighting back now with this recall thing. They're now saying all the signatures on the recall petitions are not valid.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody see that new show 'Queer Eye for the Straight Guy?' You hear about this show? The premise is five gay guys makeover a straight guy.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To raise money, the President Clinton Library -- they are building a library down there in Little Rock, Arkansas, I believe.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President has invited Palestinian Prime Minister Abu Mazen to Washington next week. Bush will urge Mazen to stop his people from inciting violence in the region. And Mazen will urge Bush to do the same.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Federal Government announced today that the recession -- the recession ended back in November of 2001. It ended two years ago. Be sure to pass that on to all your unemployed friends.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So you know what that means? The past 20 months of job layoffs, corporate bankruptcies, declining stocks -- those were the good times.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With the recent rulings, Pat Robertson says the Supreme Court -- the Supreme Court has opened the door to gay marriage, bigamy, legalized prostitution, even incest -- or as we call that in LA, 'reality TV.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Pat Robertson says he's praying to God to make several Supreme Court justices step down. Do you think at this point, God has put Pat Robertson on his 'Do not call' list?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Clintons are on a diet. You see that in the paper today? The new craze is the South Beach diet, and Bill and Hillary are on it together. The goal is to get down to the same weight they were at when Bill first started cheating on her. They want to get down to that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it's working. Apparently, Bill finally learned to push away from the table no matter who's under it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A top executive board member at the National Education Association suspended for 20 days by Vermont school officials after he was caught having sex with a teacher in the classroom while the students were outside. Remember the old days, when the phrase 'easy teacher' meant they gave a lot of A's?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I had a -- you ever have one of those days, like a tough day, a hard day, a frustrating day? I'm at my wits end. Do you have any idea how hard it is to buy uranium from Africa? It's virtually impossible. I was on Ebay all day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Talk about something disturbing. Listen to this. Have you heard about these reports. To raise money now, Al Qaeda, you did he what they are doing? They are making designer jeans. Isn't that crazy? I believe they are available at the 'Gap for Lunatics.' That's the only place you are going to get them.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush was in Texas. He raised over $7 million over the weekend, yeah. And that was just to hire a fact checker for next year's State of the Union speech.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new study just out today, only 46% of likely voters now say that President Bush deserves to be reelected. 46%. Well, that shouldn't bother him. That's more people than voted for him the last time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said today, he will not send troops to Liberia until he gets some bogus information from the CIA to justify it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;TV talk show host Jerry Springer running for senator from the great state of Ohio. The people there couldn't be prouder. Are you proud of Jerry? Well, that's the thing, is, see, you think Jerry Springer's people will turn out to vote for him? You know, usually when a Jerry Springer fan goes into a little booth, it's with a handful of quarters. You know what I'm saying?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In New Jersey this past weekend -- listen to this -- they auctioned off an old pair of John F. Kennedy's boxer shorts for $5,000. It was put up for auction by one of Jackie Kennedy's personal assistants. Nice to see they're not cashing in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And here's a little word of advice -- if anybody tries to sell you some of Ted Kennedy's underpants, burn them! Okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Delta Airlines announced it made a profit last quarter, after the government gave them $251 million. Duh! The airline made a profit, the government's broke. Shouldn't it be the other way around?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The pilot of a chartered plane flying from the Bahamas to Ft. Lauderdale was videotaped -- the pilot was videotaped sleeping by the passengers. The passengers heard snoring. They go up there, he's asleep. They videotape it. In fact, when they heard he was sleeping on the plane, the FAA immediately suspended his pilot's license and gave him a job as an airport security guard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today in court, New York City, Martha Stewart's lawyers blasted these pre-indictment leaks and asked the judge to investigate the leaks. There's secret information leaking out of the courtroom. If there's anything that offends Martha Stewart, it's insiders getting secret information ahead of her.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President George W. Bush has a ranch down in Crawford, Texas, and over the weekend he hosted Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi, or as George Bush calls him, Carlos.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, if you haven't heard, it looks like Saddam Hussein's sons were killed. Four-hour gun battle. The gun battle, they said, was the most intense firefight since Snoop Dogg went to the BET Awards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Iraqi citizen who told us where Saddam Hussein's sons were hiding, now eligible for the $30 million award. $15 million each. $30 million. And listen to this. Once he gets the $30 million, then of course he'll get a tax cut.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What else is happening in the world right now? There is a big war going on in Liberia. You see, we can't be the world's policemen. We can't go around to these different countries settling disputes every time they break out. Besides, they don't have any oil there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Bush invited the Italian Premier, Silvio Berlusconi to his Texas ranch. Actually one embarrassing incident.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Washington, Capitol Police were called in to restore order at the Ways and Means Committee. It seems some Republican told 71-year- old California Democrat Pete Stark to 'Shut up, shut up.' Stark said, 'You think you're big enough to make me, you little wimp? Come over here, make me, I dare you, you little fruitcake.' That what he called him, he said, 'You little fruitcake.' See, that's why congress needs some new blood to restore dignity and honor. That's why Jerry Springer is running.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's the latest hot rumor. Arianna Huffington may run against Arnold Schwarzenegger for governor of California. Yeah, you heard about this?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, Saddam Hussein's two sons were reportedly killed in a raid by US forces. Two guys gone. Yeah. Yeah, after hearing about it, Saddam said, 'That's not fair -- I'm the one that's supposed to kill members of my family.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Democratic presidential candidate Richard Gephardt referred to President Bush's foreign policy as 'machismo' and 'arrogant unilateralism.' Yeah. Yeah, Bush was furious and told Gephardt, 'You wouldn't dare say that if I knew what it meant.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Latest news from British intelligence, Saddam Hussein was this close, this close to buying cryptonite. British intelligence. That's what they said.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What's happening. Uday and Qusay are dead. No word on Saddam's daughter, Sleazay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Arab world is speaking out about the deaths of Uday and Qusay. They're talking about it today on Al Jazeera. ... Now I'm tuned to Al Jazeera. No, Saddam Hussein said it was an outrage, bin Laden said it was a disgrace, and the former Iraqi information minister said, 'I just had lunch with them an hour ago. They're looking fabulous. The boys are playing golf right now.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's quite dramatic. Apparently, they were killed after a six-hour gunfight. Six-hour gunfight, or as we call that in LA, 'rush hour.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, if you don't know anything about Uday and Qusay, I mean, these were bad guys. This is what they did all day -- they watched porno, they drank alcohol and they gambled. That's what they did all day long -- which of course has now got Congress worried, 'cause they're now going, 'They can shoot you for that?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is actually good news for Governor Gray Davis, 'cause apparently, Uday and Qusay were this close to signing the recall petition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And good news for that Iraqi citizen, the one who told us where Saddam Hussein's sons were hiding. He's going to be getting a $30 million reward. $30 million. The bad news, Anna Nicole Smith now looking for him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, it was our old friend Bob Dole's birthday. God bless him. Bob Dole is 80 years old. 80 years old. ... Did you see Bob? He was on the Larry King show, and the guests were Larry King, Mike Wallace and Bob Dole, the three of them. Looked like the skeleton crew from Pirates of the Caribbean, you know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Monica Lewinsky, 30 years old today. Bob Dole and Monica. Well, it's interesting, 'cause here you have a guy who wanted Bill Clinton's job and a girl who gave Bill Clinton a...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know President Clinton sent Monica Lewinsky a present? Did you know that? See that? Actually, it was a gag gift.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Monica is 30 years old. Do you believe that? I can remember when she was knee-high.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Uday and Qusay, you heard about this? They were hiding in a villa owned by their cousin. So the two sons of Saddam Hussein, that's where they're hiding out, they go to a cousin's house and US forces have to use machine guns, antitank missiles, they had to use attack helicopters, and I'm telling you, that's what it takes to get relatives out of your house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So now Uday and Qusay are dead and sadly, they did not get to try out the new Baghdad McDonald's.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They say that Uday and Qusay were videotaped going into their cousin's house. Sounds to me like somebody got punk'd. Somebody got punk'd.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Time now for celebrity birthday. Today Monica Lewinsky, 30 years old. 30 years old today. Boy, how time flies, it seems like only yesterday she was crawling around on the floor of the Oval Office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the Washington Post, Iraqi soldiers claim they've been mistreated by US troops. That's right. Yeah, the US troops deny this, but they did admit to making the Iraqi troops watch 'From Justin to Kelly.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you for coming out on yet another hot day. I was sweating like Saddam Hussein reading the obituaries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's now hotter in LA than where Saddam Hussein's kids are right now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Saddam's sons are now in hell. I guess you all know that. Let's hope the rest of the family is united as soon as possible.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nobody is happier about this turn of events than George Bush. Nobody's -- well, except maybe Kobe Bryant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, today, they released these graphic photos of the dead sons of Saddam there. They said these are the most shocking pictures, I guess, since Nick Nolte's mug shot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I understand they're now selling the pictures of Uday and Qusay on Ebay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, they still have not set up the funeral arrangements yet for Uday and Qusay. But they did say in lieu of flowers, the White House has asked that contributions be made to the George Bush reelection campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, now with Uday and Qusay gone, US forces can of course concentrate on getting the biggest fish of all - Martha Stewart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's a huge surprise. Former President Bill Clinton came to President Bush's defense yesterday on the Larry King show. He called in to Larry King, defending Bush about the State of the Union address. Here's what Clinton said. He said, 'Give President Bush a break. Everybody makes mistakes.' In fact, Clinton said he once made a mistake that weighed 250 pounds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bill Clinton defending George Bush? You ever think you'd see that, Clinton defending George Bush? Clinton defending Kobe, maybe, but Bush?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the upcoming People magazine -- I heard this on the radio this morning - I guess Kobe Bryant bought his beautiful wife Vanessa a $4 million, eight carat diamond ring. ... $4 million? Boy, all Hillary got was a Senate seat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it's official. Gray Davis has become the first governor in California history to face a recall election. This is unbelievable. Do you know how the recall works? Do you people understand this? You know what's going to happen? On October 7th, 15 bachelors will move into the governor's mansion, and each week, Trista will eliminate one person.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Uday and Qusay Hussein are gone, and Saddam only has two sons left. It's Germane and Tito. That's all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear how they found out where Qusay and Uday were staying? They were at a cousin's house and they got a tip, they think maybe from the owner of the house. So they are visiting their cousins, Uday and Qusay, and they videotaped them. They were like punk'd going in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, the US forces show us, because they know Uday and Qusay are in the house, they used antitank missiles to get them out. They used helicopters to get them out. They used grenades to get them out. I tell you when, I want my relatives out of my house, all I do is cut off the booze.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here is news from the world of show business. Sharon Stone will be playing Hillary Clinton in an upcoming movie. Sharon Stone will be playing the part of Hillary Clinton married to Bill Clinton. I was thinking if Hillary Clinton in real live actually looked like Sharon Stone -- there's a good chance Bill would not have been impeached.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, at an auction, a pair of boxer shorts once worn by President John F. Kennedy sold for $5,000. Isn't that interesting? Yeah, also going for $5,000 was a bra once worn by Ted Kennedy.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, I guess by now, you've all seen -- the Pentagon released those graphic photos of Uday and Qusay Hussein yesterday. Did you see those photos? And today, they released a gruesome video of them all made up. Did you see, they cut their hair, they shaved their beards? At first, I thought I was watching that show, 'Extreme Makeover.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, I guess to clean them up and cover the bullet holes and stuff, they used this mortician's putty. It's the same stuff they use on the guys at '60 Minutes' every day.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A number of Arabs still say they do not believe Uday and Qusay are dead. They don't believe it. They said they want more proof. So today, we shot them again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, right as we're talking, the government is performing these autopsies on their bodies. It must be some tense moments waiting for those results. Gee, I wonder what they died of, huh? Think maybe that cruise missile through the head had something to do with it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And of course, you know, now with his sons gone, that makes Saddam an empty nester.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's talk now he's looking to adopt some foster thugs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what the reward is if you capture Saddam? You don't even have to capture Saddam, if you just say where he is. Do you know what the reward is? $25 million. This is what I love about our priorities. We spend $25 million trying to get rid of Saddam Hussein, the Republicans are spending $50 million trying to get rid of Gray Davis. You know, it doesn't seem, it doesn't seem quite right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't want to say Gray Davis is on the run, but today, he released an audiotape on the Al Jazeera network from his underground bunker somewhere in the Sacramento area.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gray Davis is the first Governor in California history to face a recall election. In fact, when Davis got the news about the recall, he was surrounded by his loved ones -- 50 electric company executives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Davis said yesterday, and I quote -- this is the actual quote -- he is gonna fight 'like a Bengal Tiger.' Which I believe is also an endangered species.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And there's all this talk about Arnold Schwarzenegger. You know where he is now? Visiting Mexico. He's in Mexico right now. See, I think this means he's definitely going to run for Governor. See, Arnold is smart. He's in Mexico campaigning in front of the very people who will be living here by election time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the state of Florida said today it will help restore the voting rights to 125,000 felons. Well, thank God they're working on the important issues down there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, that makes sense. A lot of people thought the last election was stolen anyway. Might as well let felons vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you think it's fair? Should we let criminals vote? Hey, we already let them hold office. What the hell's the difference?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big story this week, Kobe Bryant admitted he was guilty of adultery, and adultery only. He is only guilty of adultery. He said this is something between him, his wife and God. Otherwise known as 'the Clinton defense.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Gore's daughter Kristen -- you met Kristen, Al Gore's daughter. A lovely girl, has written a novel. It's the story of a young Capitol Hill staffer who works for an Ohio congressman on a health care subcommittee. I guess that boring gene doesn't fall too far from the tree, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hate talking about people who are not here, but boy did this audience stink last night. Just listen to this. Halfway through the show they wanted to have me replaced with Arnold Schwarzenegger. It was awful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Uday and Qusay Hussein were gunned down over there in Mosul in Iraq by US forces. These guys were tough. They were at the top of the most wanted list and they were considered very dangerous. As were nearly as dangerous as a Boston priest, as a matter of fact.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To prove to the people of Iraq that they were dead, the US decided to release photos of Uday and Qusay. Those photos were not pretty. They were gruesome. They were awful photos, but still not as bad as Nick Nolte's mug shot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Are you folks excited about the big Seabiscuit movie that opens today? You know, you know the story here. Seabiscuit won like two big races, and then was put out to stud. It's the same plan they had for Bill Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Newsweek magazine is reporting that after Uday was killed, US forces found a briefcase next to his body and the briefcase contained cologne, Viagra, men's underwear, $100 million in cash -- and one single condom. That is so typical guy, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's got a $15 million bounty on his head, hundreds of troops waiting outside the door waiting to kill him, and he's thinking, 'Maybe there'll be some chicks there, I'll bring a condom just in case.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;US forces in Iraq are intensifying the hunt now for Saddam Hussein. They say he moves every two to four hours, which has got to be annoying for his friends, huh? 'Can you help me move?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Got to move every two to four hours, what a pain. Putting up that security deposit, getting it back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the military said that Saddam is running out of places to hide. Let's just hope he doesn't hide with his weapons of mass destruction, man, we'll never find him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our coalition forces still trying to find the billion of dollars Qusay and Uday took from the bank of Iraq. Hey, forget that money, we can't even find the $38 billion that Governor Gray Davis lost. Where's that money? I'd like to know where that went.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know, those of you that don't know, our Governor is being recalled, the first time in California history, and at a press conference, Governor Davis told reporters, this is what he said, he said, 'In a strange way, this has got my juices flowing.' Actually, he just wet his pants. That's what happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Sacramento Bee is reporting -- I didn't get this from Arnold, but I got it from the Sacramento Bee. They are reporting that Arnold Schwarzenegger is not going to run for governor. But you know what would be better? Arnold should do what he does in the Terminator movies, he should go back in time and prevent Gray Davis from ever being born.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush spoke at the annual conference of the Urban League. See, I'm not sure Bush is familiar with the Urban League. The first thing he did was congratulate them on beating the National League at the All Star game.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And how about Lance Armstrong? Fifth time, Tour de France. Pretty amazing. It is unbelievable, isn't it? Fives time with cancer and all that. You know, he now has more victories in France than the German army. Do you know that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to a new documentary, Bill Clinton's favorite movie, anybody know what it is? Bill Clinton's all time favorite movie, no, no, 'American Beauty.&quot;American Beauty.' Isn't that odd? A distinguished President like Bill Clinton, his favorite film is about a guy trapped in a loveless marriage who's obsessed with having sex with a young girl.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody is talking about Uday and Qusay Hussein, they were gunned down last week and everybody is still talking about it. You know how they were captured, they were turned in by a relative. And I believe that's the same way they nailed Martha Stewart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US released photos of Uday and Qusay after they had been gunned down, and did you see them? They were gruesome, oh, my God, I haven't seen a face so grotesquely disfigured since, well, like Michael Jackson.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US is now under pressure, under pressure to try and take Saddam Hussein alive so that he can be tried for crimes against humanity. Today, Hussein claimed he was only guilty of adultery. So I don't know.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Saddam Hussein released yet another audiotape today. Is it just me, or is he like one of these annoying record clubs now? Every month, he sends me tapes. I didn't order these!&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You hear his latest thing? He now says if he had 100 kids, he would gladly send them on the same path as Uday and Qusay. He wouldn't go with them, he'd just send them out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you all saw the bodies of Uday and Qusay? You know, people wonder, you know what I'm saying? How did the bodies of the Hussein brothers -- how did they look so good? You know, people say, 'Well, what did they do to make them look so good even though they were dead?' Apparently this is a very popular thing they use over there. This is 'Oil of Uday,' have you seen 'Oil of Uday?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush has refused to declassify portions of a congressional 9/11 report about the Saudis. You hear about this? 'Cause he says it will help the enemy. Not Al Qaeda, you know, the Democrats.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Bob Graham of Florida says if we applied the same standards of impeachment to President Bush in Iraq as we did with President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky, Bush would be impeached. That's what he said. Now, you see, see, I think these are two completely different situations. I mean, one President was invading Arab territory. The other President was invading Jewish territory. Those are two totally different things.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you, this recall thing really gaining steam here in California. It's always, all people talk about here. Well, you know what's interesting, Gray Davis is so unpopular -- they said today -- a recent poll actually said he would lose a recall election to Arnold. He would lose to Arnold. Not Schwarzenegger, Arnold from 'Diff'rent Strokes.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Gray Davis, interesting man, he said this recall has gotten his juices flowing again. That's what he said. That was his exact quote. It was reported today that former President Bill Clinton's going to come to California to help Davis in his recall election campaign. And believe me, if anyone can show Davis how to keep those juices flowing, it is Bill Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was also talk of bringing Al Gore to California to help out. They're concerned that both Gray Davis and Al Gore in the same state could cause some kind of rolling personality blackout.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, a new survey shows that wealthy Americans, wealthy Americans are growing more and more confident about the future of the economy. Well, duh, you think that has anything to do with the huge tax cut they just got, do you? An extra 30 grand in your pocket, that could help out a little bit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Tour de France, Lance Armstrong &quot;came in one minute and one second ahead of the rider from Germany. Let me tell you something. Anytime you can beat the Germans into Paris, that is an accomplishment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And people say, 'What drives him?' They don't know what drives him. Hey, I think I know. He's an American, traveling through France. You want to get out of there as soon as possible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Telemarketing companies are now suing the Federal Government over this new do-not-call list. You know the do-not-call list you can be put on? They say so far it's caused over 2 million telemarketers to lose their jobs. Yeah. And the problem is?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to Time magazine, more and more drug dealers were using our national parks as a place to grow their marijuana. Which is very dangerous to campers, don't you think? I mean, you don't want to come across a stoned Grizzly Bear who's got the munchies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the New York Post, our old friend Paula Jones, Paula Jones pregnant again. Yeah, no word on who the lucky cousin is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here is some good news, the US government says it is hot on the trail of Saddam Hussein. ... You know, when they say they are hot on the trail, you what that means, it means a year from now, the US government will be saying they are hot on the trail of Saddam Hussein.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They say that Saddam is alone. They say he is isolated, but he still has more loyal followers than California Governor Gray Davis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know last week, they gunned down Saddam Hussein's sons. They gunned down, it was Uday and Qusay. They looked at the stuff they left behind. Uday had a briefcase that contained cheap vodka, underwear, cologne. The cologne is when you run out of cheap vodka.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A suitcase full of cologne, vodka, underwear, and Viagra. Coincidentally, that's what President Bush found when he moved into the Oval Office.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the newest reports, they say Saddam Hussein has left Iraq. Actually, he's pretty smart. What he did was, he disguised himself as Geraldo, ignored everybody and waited for the military to kick him out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As I'm sure you know, Saddam Hussein has released yet another audiotape. You know, this guy won't shut up.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think he's starting to lose it. Have you heard the latest tape? It's all about how to sand and refinish your redwood deck.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the White House says they're this close, this close to getting Saddam Hussein and this close to getting Gray Davis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, you know, something like 90 people have now filed to run for governor in this recall election. They say there could be as many as 200 people on the ballot. You know, it's real easy to run in California. All you need like is a couple of signatures -- not many -- and $3,500 bucks, you're on the ballot, like that. I mean, what does this say about California? We have stricter requirements to get on American Idol than we do to be governor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Arnold Schwarzenegger has still not officially bowed out of the race. It looks like he's not going to run. But I tell you, if Arnold does run, he better get on the ballot. You don't want to be a write-in with a name like Arnold Schwarzenegger.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush's economic team are now on their 'Jobs and Growth' bus tour all across America. Jobs and growth bus tour. Have you seen that one? Jobs and growth bus tour. That's what they're calling it. That means the only job they created so far is for the guy driving the bus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, President Bush defended his national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, calling her 'a fabulous person.' That's what he said today, he said, 'She is fabulous!' Think Bush is watching too many of these gay reality shows? Have you ever heard anybody in the White House - 'They're fabulous. Donald Rumsfeld, fabulous!&quot;And marvelous. Tommy Franks.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I didn't get this. They asked Bush about gay marriage today and what he thought about it. This is what Bush said today, this is an actual quote. He said, 'I am mindful we are all sinners, and I caution though, who may try to take a speck out of the neighbors' eye when they have a log in their own.' Even Jesse Jackson said, 'What? What did he say? Does anyone know what that means?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess there are reports in the news today that prostitution has returned to the streaks of Baghdad. Streets of Baghdad. They've gone from a no-fly zone to an open fly zone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, they said today, they said it was $20 to look for your weapon of mass destruction, $50 if they find it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a new audio tape from Saddam Hussein. Last week Uday and Qusay bit the dust, and now...now there's a new audio tape from Saddam Hussein, and you can tell that it's authentic, and you can tell that it's current because in the audio tape he mentions the Liza Minelli split.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But they say now that Saddam Hussein is hiding and that he's being sheltered by friends. I can't believe it, this guy has more of a life than I do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He may have altered his appearance, Saddam Hussein, they think he may are altered his appearance. And if not, the 101st Airborne can do it for him.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was so hot, Saddam Hussein offered to turn himself in for a Klondike bar. That's how hot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, it's interesting, although many Iraqi citizens have seen the videos of the dead bodies of Uday and Qusay, they still do not believe they're really dead. You know, we have the same problem here in LA with Dodger fans. They see it, they just can't accept it.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many watched President Bush's press conference yesterday? You see that thing? You ever notice, there are long pauses in Bush's answers to questions? It always takes him a long time to kind of finish a sentence. You're never sure if he's gonna finish it, you know? But, see, people like President Bush, so they kind of root for him while he's doing it, you know? Like, you're watching, you're sitting there going, 'Come on, you can do it, troops are where in, in, Iraq, yeah, Iraq!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush now looking into legislation that would define marriage, as opposed to the last Administration, in which the Clintons redefined marriage. That was totally different.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll tell you, things just keep getting worse for our Governor, Gray Davis. You hear about this? Oh, boy. Today, General Motors recalled his car.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it looks like Arnold Schwarzenegger still debating whether to run for governor of California. See, he should run. He has the one thing, the one thing that practically every person from California can relate to, he was born in another country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And there's talk that Al Gore may run again in 2004. Hey -- he's a lot less popular now. So he could win.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, you heard Gore's new campaign slogan? 'Gore, rise of the machine.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Paula Jones is pregnant. They say it could be a risky pregnancy for Jones, not because of her age or any medical things, she keeps putting on more and more weight, she runs the risk of Clinton hitting on her again.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're not believed to have any information about their dad's whereabouts. They said they had a falling out with their father a couple of years ago when he had both their husbands killed. Well, that will create a little tension at the dinner table, huh?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To be fair, I guess Saddam had to kill them both. Because you don't want to look like you're playing favorites, you know what I mean?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I guess today, again -- this is the second one this week -- Saddam Hussein released another tape. Another tape! You know, forget the weapons of mass destruction. When we find his stupid tape recorder, just break that thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And one of the first tasks ahead in the new Iraq is writing a constitution, to which Attorney General Ashcroft said, 'Constitution, what's that?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush held his first full press conference in over five months this week. He announced the war in terrorism is continuing. Much, much more work needs to be done on the economy. And Saddam Hussein has not yet been captured. And then he said, 'I'm going on vacation for a month. See you later. Good-bye, everybody.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former President Bill Clinton said he's coming to California to help Governor Gray Davis in his recall election campaign. Which is ironic, isn't it? I mean, when Clinton was president, he couldn't recall anything, remember?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When we finally have this recall election in October, there could be as many as 200 people on the ballot. You know what's really scary? Most of them don't know the first thing about driving a state into bankruptcy. You know? They're not experts like Governor Gray Davis. They don't know how to do it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know who else entered the governor's race? Hustler publisher Larry Flynt. I'm not making it up. Larry Flynt. Well, that should silence the critics who claim this recall is nothing but a big circus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Larry Flynt as governor. Suddenly 'Senator Jerry Springer' doesn't sound so bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why would Larry Flynt want to leave the porno industry and get into something sleazy like politics?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, you know last week it was Uday and Qusay, adios! Which is too bad, because we had been trying to get them on the show.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now there are rumors that Saddam Hussein himself is hiding with his last few loyalists. No, wait a minute, that's California Governor Gray Davis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See what you think of this. President Bush is leaving to go to Crawford, Texas for a 35-day working vacation. This should go over big with all the people taking a 'can't get work' vacation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House says that the vacation in Texas will give President Bush the chance to unwind. Unwind -- my question is, when does the guy wind?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here is good news, now you can buy a set of President Clinton, Bill Clinton trading cards. You know like the baseball cards, these are presidential.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you think that's unusual that the President gets an entire month off? I mean, who else in America can take an entire month of work off? Okay, except for the Dodgers.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yet another Saddam Hussein tape has come out. In this one he urges citizens to fight back and feel free to loot and steal state property. I'm sorry, that was Gray Davis' new tape. I'm sorry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Governor Gray Davis has asked the California state Supreme Court to delay the October recall vote, 'cause he says that's not enough time to put on a fair election. Let me tell you something -- if we didn't need a fair election to pick the President of the US, we don't need a fair election to pick the governor of California.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know how many people are going to run for governor now? It's now over 300. Over 300 people are prepared to file to run for governor. That's more people than saw the movie 'Gigli' this weekend.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Saddam Hussein's two daughters were on the news over the weekend. ... Apparently they had been granted asylum in Jordan along with their kids. Do you know about this? It seems Saddam Hussein had their husbands shot in 1996, and neither of the girls have remarried. You'd think guys would be knocking down the door.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the other day, on MSNBC, the White House released a videotape of President Bush meeting with his Cabinet. And today, Iraqi officials say they believe the tape is authentic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US is putting together a constitution for Iraq. You know, why don't we just give them ours? I mean, think about it, it served us well for over 200 years. And we don't appear to be using it anymore. So, what the heck. Let's give them ours.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And that guy in Iraq who told us where Uday and Qusay were hiding -- hear about this? He's about to get his $30 million reward. Do you know what he said today, you know the first thing he's going to buy? Weapons of mass destruction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And here's a sign of changing times. Donald Rumsfeld, our Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld has hired a gay activist as his special adviser on all major personnel decisions of the Department of Defense. Isn't that amazing? Kind of a 'Queer Eye for the Pentagon Guy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, I knew something was up. Like, today they asked Rumsfeld how the war was going, he said, 'Fabulous.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you know the Bush Administration now wants to put a ban on gay marriages. And a lot of gay men, of course, upset. And that can be frustrating -- always the wedding planner, never the bride.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems Arkansas' top emergency official resigned after he was caught sending his employees an email where he made fun of immigrants and welfare recipients.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And disgraced Ohio Congressman James Traficant is forming a committee to explore a campaign for president from prison. His top issue, prison reform.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So far, he's raised $3 and 17 cartons of cigarettes.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Martha Stewart is 62 years old. Unbelievable, isn't it? Martha, she celebrated quietly with a few close lawyers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's good news, President Bush is now on his 35-day vacation. How many of you folks get a 35-day vacation? Well, it gives him a chance to unwind and of course the question is, well, when does he wind?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's down there on vacation in Crawford, Texas and before he left he had his annual physical and got a clean bill of health, green light, everything is fine. And they think it's because he stays in pretty good cardiovascular condition, he works out every day on an elliptical trainer. And former President Clinton used to work out...now, wait a minute. President Clinton would work out on a stationary intern.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, some exciting news. Military experts say our troops are closing in. The noose is tightening. They think it's just a matter of a few days, and we should have the producers of the movie 'Gigli' in custody.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, President Bush is on his 29-day vacation, which is 3 days longer than last year. Well, can you blame him? Have you ever been to Crawford, Texas? You can't squeeze it all in in 26 days.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush passed his annual physical. He is in excellent health. He has a heart rate of 45 beats per minute, which is pretty good. Pretty good. Except when you ask him about weapons mass destruction, then it goes to 800 beats per minute.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, the doctor said the only difference was this year Bush gained five pounds. Well, the White House said it was all muscle. Well, he keeps a pretty rigorous workout schedule that includes jogging, lifting weights and a stretching routine. He stretches a lot. Especially during those State of the Union addresses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love this story. Donald Rumsfeld, Defense Secretary, has hired a gay activist as his special adviser of personnel decisions. Special adviser of personnel. That's what he said. Not personal decisions. Wrong joke.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That shows you times are changing. And this has really opened up the way the military looks at things. In fact, the new policy is 'Go ahead and ask, go ahead and tell, we're queer, we're here, yeah!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean -- Howard Dean is on the cover of both Time and Newsweek. And presidential candidate John Edwards is on the side of a milk carton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Attorneys for California Governor Gray Davis have filed a lawsuit to delay an October recall election. One attorney to Davis said that she thought it was both unfair and unconstitutional, which is lawyer talk for 'Our guy's screwed.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's my favorite part of this whole recall thing. Governor Davis has asked the California Supreme Court to put his name on the ballot with the other candidates seeking to replace him. He wants to be on the ballot. I mean, how stupid is this? Let's see, let's replace him with him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'I wish to replace myself.' To which Saddam Hussein said, 'You can do that?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're all excited because President Bush has started his 35-day vacation. How many of you folks every year get a 35-day vacation? Okay. He is down in there in Crawford, Texas. On the first day of his vacation he went fishing. He didn't find any fish, but he believes they are there and that his intelligence is accurate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Before he left on his vacation, he went for his annual physical and the checkup and they said everything is perfect. They said&quot; he's in &quot;great shape considering all of the pressure and stress of his job. They said he is fantastic. He has the body of 40-year-old -- wait a minute, that's Ashton Kutcher.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former vice presidential candidate Joe Lieberman said today that if the Democrats nominated Howard Dean, it would be 'a ticket to nowhere.' Yeah. Yeah, Lieberman added, 'And if there's one thing I know, it's about being on a ticket to nowhere.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A congresswoman from Texas...is complaining because hurricanes are never given African American names. Yeah. True story. As a result, today, the National Weather Service gave a shout out to Hurricane Tyrell.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to NBC News election headquarters. I'm your host, Tim Russert.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Man, this governor's race in California -- it is just getting crazy. Hear about this? Just moments ago, 'Seabiscuit' announced he's running.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because of this recall thing, experts say the number of people running for governor could reach 500. We got 500 people. We need to bring in Simon from American Idol to thin out the herd.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's how bad California looks to the rest of the country. Do you know this? People in Florida are laughing at us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, Gray Davis got some good news this week. The Clintons are here in California campaigning for him. Actually, Hillary is campaigning for Davis. I think Bill is campaigning for Larry Flynt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you know about that. Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flint, also running for governor. He's serious, he's running. I don't know, on election day you really want supporters of Larry Flint going to a curtained off booth by themselves?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who should run for governor of California? Mike Tyson. Let me tell you. Let me tell you. He's built like Schwarzenegger, he spends like Davis and he sounds like Barbara Boxer. He'd be perfect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush had his annual physical on Saturday. He is in terrific shape. He's in unbelievable shape. The economy is on life support, but he's doing great.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Interesting, President Bush said today the economy is getting better, and people are beginning to notice. To which Kobe Bryant's wife said, 'You know, I've noticed that.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know why they tell us this, but the White House also reported that President Bush has no sexually transmitted diseases. I guess there was some concern he might have picked up something left over from the last Administration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, President Bush is on his month-long vacation. He's out for one month, which is good news for North Korea, which means we won't be bombing them until, oh, at least Labor Day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, President Bush sent seven soldiers to Liberia today. Seven -- eight? Is it eight? Sent eight soldiers to Liberia. Eight. You know what that means? No oil there!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Jerry Springer announced he is not running for senator in Ohio. I guess he felt politics was just too sleazy, you know? He didn't want to sink down to that level.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're all going after one another now. Presidential candidate Joe Lieberman took a shot at frontrunner Howard Dean. Howard Dean. He took a shot at him this week. He said, 'Howard Dean is a ticket to nowhere.' At least Lieberman will have somebody to ride with now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Disgraced Ohio Congressman James Traficant is forming a committee to explore the possibility of running for president from prison. He's running from prison. His number one priority, outlawing sodomy again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what makes me feel good? George W. Bush is still on his 35 day vacation. Hell, I didn't get 35 days off when I had my bypass surgery!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to reports, Korea, North Korea and Iran are working together to make nuclear warheads. That's pretty frightening isn't it? You know, if they wanted to make a huge bomb, what they really ought to do is bring in Ben and J-Lo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today -- big news - Jerry Springer announced that he will not run for the US Senate. Yeah. Yeah, when asked about it, Springer said, 'Politics is a dirty business, but I'm still not interested.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Arnold Schwarzenegger announced that he is going to run for governor on our program last night. You know, I got to tell you something, my staff didn't know. Arnold's staff didn't know. I didn't know. I was as shocked as everyone. I had all these questions about who are you going to support and everything. I tell you something. If he doesn't get elected governor, maybe he should work for the CIA. He can keep a secret better than they can.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you, if Arnold's elected, you know who I feel sorry for? The people on death row. Imagine you're about to be executed, the governor calls, you think it's your reprieve, you hear that, 'Hasta la vista, baby.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Arnold Schwarzenegger said last night on the show he expected his opponents to throw all kinds of dirt at him. And, you know, it started already. First day. It's already started. I don't know if you saw it. Today, they released the one thing that could really hurt Arnold. It turns out he once starred in a movie with Tom Arnold.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This recall thing here in California has actually reached what they call critical mass. You know what that is? That means there are now more people registered to run for governor than there are registered to vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who's running? Gary Coleman. Remember Gary Coleman? I swear to God. He paid his fee. He's running for governor. He says his first order of business, lower the minimum height requirements on rides at Disneyland.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The publisher of Hustler magazine, Larry Flynt -- he is also running. Flynt say he wan to solve our budget crisis by opening more casinos. And what a coincidence, Larry Flynt just happens to own several casinos. You know, that's like having a president whose background is in the oil industry making environmental decisions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, as of today, we have Arnold Schwarzenegger, Gary Coleman, Gallagher the comedian, Larry Flynt, Angelyne. I don't know if it's an election or a bad episode of Hollywood Squares.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush, still on vacation. Aides say the President needs to get away from the White House to relax. See, that's the difference between Clinton and Bush, right there. Clinton could find ways to relax without even leaving.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sure you heard, President Bush passed his annual physical with flying colors. He's in tip-top shape. Doctor says his reflexes are excellent. Every time they hit him on the knee, he bombed Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Arnold Schwarzenegger announced he is running for governor of California. Pretty exciting don't you think? I missed the whole thing. The one night, the one night that I forget to watch Leno and this happens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's official. Arnold said that he will enter the race for governor. At least that is what everybody thinks he said.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush has been silent on Schwarzenegger. Of course he can't pronounce Schwarzenegger.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it's day four of President Bush's 35-day vacation. Is it me or is the country seem to be running a little more smoothly?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is spending his vacation down there on the family ranch in Crawford, Texas. Nice time to be down there. It's about 140. Earlier today he went out looking for stray cows. He couldn't find any but he is confident they are there and that he is using good intelligence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I still can't get over this, President Bush is on a 35 day vacation. Do you folks get 35 days off a year? You don't get 35 days off a year and do you know why you don't? Because at your job, they need you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Arnold Schwarzenegger announced he would run for governor of California. That's the news. Arnold's gonna run. Yeah. That's right. Yeah, the announcement was good news for Florida residents who now live in the second flakiest state in the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apparently, Arnold was inspired by President Bush, who proved you can be a successful politician in this country even if English is your second language.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the Pentagon, since Saddam Hussein has been hiding, he's been moving his location three times a day to make sure he can't be found. That's what they said. The weird thing is, they're saying the same thing about Ben Affleck and J-Lo.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, welcome to day three of California's recall election campaign. Or as we call it, freaky Friday, ladies and gentlemen. Yeah!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More and more candidates getting in, boy. The candidate for the Green Party has jumped into the governor's race today, to which President Bush said, 'Oh, my God. The Hulk is running, truly?'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Arnold Schwarzenegger made another major announcement. He said his lieutenant governor will be Xena, warrior princess.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what's amazing, even Arnold's advisers said they were shocked by his decision to run. I mean, these people were backstage Wednesday night. They had no idea. Nobody had any idea. He totally fooled them. They said they had no idea he was running. Huh? Who knew Arnold was that good of an actor?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Arianna Huffington, you know her - 'Yes, dear, you know, we must have -' you know her. She's running. She announced her candidacy for the governorship, as well. They're talking about a debate, now, between Arianna Huffington and Arnold Schwarzenegger. First, they have to agree on a language.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what's interesting, Arianna Huffington's former husband, Michael, he's the gay ex-congressman -- he has endorsed Arnold. So this is the second time he's left Arianna for another man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Already the negative stuff has started. There's talk, there's whispers -- whispers about steroid use, lying, womanizing. And that's just for Gary Coleman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former child star Gary Coleman has announced his candidacy. He's really running. He's actually running. His slogan is not good. 'What you talking about, California?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess Gary Coleman was campaigning today down at the Glendale Galleria. No, I'm sorry. He's still working there as a security guard. That's what it was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And things are not looking too good, though, for California Governor Gray Davis. In the latest popularity polls, he is now three points behind the movie 'Gigli.' Okay, that's not good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you probably heard about this. Arnold Schwarzenegger is running for governor in California. Yeah. He announced it last night on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno, or at least that's what people think he said.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Arnold is the first body builder to run for governor since Janet Reno. Did you know that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Looks like Al Gore may be thinking about getting back into it. He gave an anti-war speech to a college crowd. It was a riveting speech. You know how exciting riveting is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush, God bless him, is on a 35 day vacation. Before he left he had his annual physical. He had his checkup and it turns out, thank God for this. This is a blessing. He is in great shape. Fantastic shape. His cholesterol now is actually lower than his approval rating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is just a regular guy. What he likes to do when he is on vacation, he goes down there to the Crawford Ranch in Texas where he has the ranch. It's lovely, August it's about 145 degrees. He goes down there and he loves to go fishing. He is a big fisherman. President Bush is a big fisherman. A lot of presidents are -- for example, Clinton was a big fisherman. Clinton liked to go out looking for the large mouthed intern.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of critics are saying Arnold can't get elected because he's just an ambitious guy with a famous name who doesn't know anything about running the government. Didn't hurt George Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush was asked over the weekend what he thought about this California recall. And he said -- this is his exact quote. He said, 'I'm a follower of American politics and I'm confident the citizens of California will sort this out.' He's a follower of American politics. I guess that comes in mighty handy when you're President of the US.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;194 candidates are running, and it may get even higher. 194. In fact, the only two now we can officially rule out are Uday and Qusay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, 194 and a half, if you count Gary Coleman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's amazing. Amazing. You know, you see him today...I mean, I'm watching -- Florida's laughing at us! Ahh!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm watching Arnold Schwarzenegger and Gary Coleman together. It looks like a bad episode of celebrity boxing, doesn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Can you imagine if Gary Coleman did win? Huh? How would you like to be Todd Bridges sitting on death row waiting for a call from Gary Coleman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gallagher, the comedian, is running also. He began campaigning over the weekend. It didn't go well. I guess he kissed three babies and hit four people over the head with that sledgematic thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hustler publisher Larry Flynt and adult film star Mary Carey, they're also running. See, you know what bothers me about this? The two of them, see, this could split the all-important porn vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, I think the biggest problem for Larry Flynt would be campaigning. I mean, think about it, would you let your baby kiss Larry Flynt?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On the Democratic side, our Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante is also running. Have you ever heard of him before? Cruz Bustamante. Doesn't that sound like some sickness you get on one of those Carnival cruises?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to take just a moment to say hello to all our troops in Liberia. Lenny, Bob, Larry, Dave, Sam, Cindy and Wendy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, the US sent seven Marines to Liberia. Seven. Seven. You know, I know the Pentagon slogan is 'An Army of One.' I didn't realize they were taking this literally now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, the President, Charles Taylor, he's the President of Liberia, he stepped down, left the country, left the country after handing over power to his Vice President, Moses Blah. B-L-A-H. Vice President Blah. Wasn't that Al Gore's Secret Service code name?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a copilot for Air France, this guy's in a lot of trouble. He thought he was making a joke when he told security screeners at JFK airport he had a bomb in his shoe. He's a pilot, come on, just the liquor talking, that's all it was.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was so hot today, Governor Gray Davis tripled the tax on ice cream trucks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some interesting information about California. The highest point -- the highest point, anybody know? Mount Whitney. Mount Whitney, the highest point. The lowest point, that will be October 7th.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Arnold Schwarzenegger got a nice note from Kobe Bryant. It said, 'Thanks for knocking me off the front page.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Arnold Schwarzenegger gave a speech in New York. He didn't want to, but it was easier to pronounce than 'California.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the first governor's recall race in 89 years. 89 years. And I believe Angelyne ran in that one, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, this California recall thing, it just keeps getting stranger and stranger. Like today, the California secretary of state said that of the 247 candidates, so far, 115 of them have been certified. He's reviewing the other 132 to see if they qualify. How embarrassing is that? Imagine being turned down because you don't meet the high standards set by Larry Flynt and Gallagher.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're going to invite every single person running for governor to be in our audience on September 22nd. Here is your chance to get on national television with your issues. We're gonna send them all written invitations. They have to respond by, what, it would be September 1st? Something like that. So September 22nd, if you're running, if you're a legitimate candidate, we have 300 seats, so we can fit everybody in and make sure they all -- oh, and Gary Coleman, don't worry, we will have a booster seat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We mentioned Larry Flynt, of course, the founder of Hustler. He's running for governor. You know what his campaign slogan is? Anybody know? 'A smut peddler who cares.' Today, Bill Clinton said, 'Hey, that was my slogan. Hey.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A porn star by the name of Mary Carey, she is running for governor. You know what her platform is? She wants to make lap dances tax deductible. Finally, some good news for Ben Affleck.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love all these politicians, 'cause they all keep saying the same thing. They keep saying, 'We'll give California back to the people. We're giving it back to the people.' Yeah, great. Now it's not worth anything anymore. They want to give it back to us. It's like that guy who borrows your car, wrecks it and goes, 'Hey, thanks, here's the keys. Appreciate it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And all nine Democratic presidential candidates have come out in support of Gray Davis. All nine of them. And today at Disneyland, all Seven Dwarves came out for Gary Coleman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And more problems today for Governor Gray Davis. Did you hear about this? I love this story. It seems the California Highway Patrol caught Davis' motorcade going 94 miles an hour in a 55 zone. They thought he was trying to make a run for the border.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Clinton met with Governor Davis to try and give him some pointers. Good luck, huh? You think Clinton can help Davis be more exciting and appealing in, what, 55 days? I mean, Clinton had eight years with Al Gore, couldn't do anything with that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and President Bush has chosen Utah Governor Mike Leavitt as the new head of the Environmental Protection Agency. Leavitt's toughest job, protecting the environment from President Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, folks, how is this for nerve? Unabomber Ted Kaczynski has asked the government to return his bomb to him that the FBI confiscated seven years ago. I got a good idea. Let's mail it to him, all right? Let's just mail him the bomb.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the latest polls, Arnold Schwarzenegger is leading in California's governor's race by 34 points. Yeah, Arnold. 34 points ahead. Yeah, you can tell that Governor Gray Davis is worried because he spent all day yesterday working on his pecs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Arnold Schwarzenegger is being criticized by the press because instead of discussing issues, he keeps reciting catch phrases like, 'Hasta la vista, baby.' Yeah, when reached for comment, Arnold said, 'Hasta la vista, baby.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And welcome to Day 119 of the Bush vacation. Isn't it 119?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, one thing about President Bush, I don't understand, and I like the guy. I like the man. But I see him on TV. He's clearing brush all day. He's chopping down -- he runs in 100 degree heat. He has a club for guys that run in 100 degree heat. Doesn't bother him. Takes a bite out of a pretzel, boom, he's down like that. Falls off a scooter. I don't understand.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Boy, it was hot today. ... 102. So hot, Satan today entered the governor's race.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And an NBC News poll has found that if the election were held today, 31% of California voters would vote for Arnold Schwarzenegger and 26% were not sure. Today, Gray Davis announced he is changing his name to 'not sure.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Governor Davis stopped at a gas station over here in Brentwood. But bad news, they weren't hiring.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because of the equal time rule, all of the candidates get equal time. If they're on TV, the others have to get the same amount of time. Arnold Schwarzenegger movies will be kept off the air for the next few months because you'd have to give the same amount of time to all these [other candidates]. You know, forget Arnold. Let's see if we can get Carrot Top to run and an end to those stupid 1-800-Collect commercials.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Arnold Schwarzenegger vowed today to get the budget under control. See, how bad are things in Sacramento when you need someone from Hollywood to show you how not to go over budget?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, have you heard about this porn star named Mary Carey who's running for president? Running for president. Running for governor. Porn star and president just seems to come together. I don't know why. I don't know why I make that connection.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She's running on a platform of taxing breast implants. Which, of course, is California's largest natural resource. Did you know that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And election officials here in California are concerned that having 247 candidates will require a ballot so long, it will difficult to count. Today in Florida, they said, 'What? You count the ballots?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as if this whole thing isn't confusing enough, I don't understand this. And I'm trying to follow it. Election officials announced this week - I guess this makes it more fair. They said the alphabet on the ballot will begin with the letter 'R,' then 'W,' then 'Q.' You know, even Sesame Street is laughing at California.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And good news in Liberia. The reign of terror has finally ended. Liberian President Charles Taylor has stepped down. He stepped down this week. And President Bush, a little sorry to see Charles Taylor go because this is one African leader whose name Bush can actually pronounce.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today President Bush said the economy is getting better. He says sales of surface-to-air missiles is up 10%.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday in New Jersey, the FBI arrested three men suspected of trying to smuggle a surface-to-air missile into the US. And did you hear their excuse? I can't believe this. They claimed they were going to Newark and didn't want to be outgunned.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, it's amazing. We spend all this time looking for weapons of mass destruction. Turns out, they're in New Jersey!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been reported that some of Arnold Schwarzenegger's opponents have been circulating naked pictures of Arnold on the Internet. That's right. Yeah. True story. Yeah, in a related story, Arnold is leading the other candidates by four inches.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Arnold Schwarzenegger has hired billionaire Warren Buffett as his senior economic adviser. His latest move, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and not to be outdone, Gary Coleman has announced that his senior economic adviser will be Thurston Howell III.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Also in California, one of the candidates running for governor -- 'cause i think there's a lot of them -- one of the candidates running for governor is a 100-year-old woman. That's the latest. Yeah, good for her. Yeah, the 100-year-old says she'd like to recall Governor Gray Davis, but more importantly she'd like to recall where she left her teeth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A company has come out with a George Bush action figure that commemorates his landing on the aircraft carrier earlier this year. Yeah. Yeah, the company says by posing Bush and making him talk, kids can get an idea what it's like to be Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We hope the lights are all back on back East. You folks know about this terrible blackout they had back East? ... But, major power outages. What? New York, Detroit, Cleveland, Toronto, Ottawa. All around the East Coast. I didn't know Gray Davis was back East.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Manhattan, totally dark. In fact, in the news, they said even the United Nations is in the dark. Oh, what else is new?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, let's see what's happening with the recall election. Or, as Arnold Schwarzenegger calls it -- 'Oktoberfest!' Yeah!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As this gets closer, Arnold Schwarzenegger has a lot of challenges ahead of him. I mean, at some point sooner or later, he's going to have to pronounce the word 'gubernatorial.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A number of candidates, now, are complaining that Arnold's getting so much of the spotlight that it's drowning out their message. Like, Arianna Huffington -- she said she hasn't been this ignored since her honeymoon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you heard Arianna Huffington new catchphrase? 'No new taxes 'cause I haven't paid the old ones.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love this story. Arianna Huffington, you know, she is a Greek woman. ... Anyway, she launched her campaign for governor by criticizing the fat cats who do not pay their fair share of taxes. Well, she paid no state income tax in the past few years and only paid $771 in Federal tax, even though she's a millionaire. Apparently, 'hypocrite' is not the only Greek word that begins with 'H.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Governor Gray Davis has been calling Bill Clinton three to four times a week. Always says the same thing, 'Help!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So how about this turnabout? Gray Davis has changed his mind. He wants to repeal the triple car tax. Remember when he just instituted that months ago? He says, 'No, that's insane. Repeal it.' He says this could save taxpayers over $5 billion. And that's just for me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You all know who Mary Carey is? You know who she is? Look, the guys are going 'Yeah.' No. She's the porn star. She's the porn star who is running for governor. She has this Website where she does naked jumping jacks. You know, I think I speak for most guys when I say, 'Yeah, that's all well and good, but where does she stand on the issues?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, Mary Carey said today she's offered to debate six guys -- all at the same time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll tell you, though, where this recall is really causing problems, over in Hollywood Squares. There are so many B-level and C-level celebrities running for governor they have to shut down production.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush came to California today. He's here to try and raise money. Hey, good luck, huh? What are we? $38 billion in debt? We should be hitting him up for some dough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush today announced the capture of a high ranking Islamic terrorist. So he's being interrogated by the CIA and you can see the effect of popular culture on the government. Like, they're calling it, 'Black Eye for the Al Qaeda Guy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republicans in the Texas state Senate have voted to fine Democrats $5,000 a day to force them to return to New Mexico from where they've been hiding. They've been hiding out in New Mexico to avoid voting on some bill. Republicans want to charge them $5,000 a day. Hey, if Democrats had that kind of dough, they'd be Republicans. Okay?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Fidel Castro had a birthday this week. 77 years old. He's got to be easy to shop for, huh? Cigars.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Apparently, 'hypocrite' is not the only Greek word that begins with 'H.'&quot;Jay Leno:&quot;And Governor Gray Davis has been calling Bill Clinton three to four times a week.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Always says the same thing, 'Help!'&quot;Jay Leno:&quot;So how about this turnabout? Gray Davis has changed his mind. He wants to repeal the triple car tax. Remember when he just instituted that months ago? He says, 'No, that's insane. Repeal it.' He says this could save taxpayers over $5 billion. And that's just for me.&quot;Jay Leno:&quot;You all know who Mary Carey is? You know who she is? Look, the guys are going 'Yeah.' No. She's the porn star. She's the porn star who is running for governor. She has this Website where she does naked jumping jacks. You know, I think I speak for most guys when I say, 'Yeah, that's all well and good, but where does she stand on the issues?'&quot;Jay Leno:&quot;Actually, Mary Carey said today she's offered to debate six guys -- all at the same time.&quot;Jay Leno:&quot;I'll tell you, though, where this recall is really causing problems, over in Hollywood Squares. There are so many B-level and C-level celebrities running for governor they have to shut down production.&quot;Jay Leno:&quot;President Bush came to California today. He's here to try and raise money. Hey, good luck, huh? What are we? $38 billion in debt? We should be hitting him up for some dough.&quot;Jay Leno:&quot;Bush today announced the capture of a high ranking Islamic terrorist. So he's being interrogated by the CIA and you can see the effect of popular culture on the government. Like, they're calling it, 'Black Eye for the Al Qaeda Guy.'&quot;Jay Leno:&quot;Republicans in the Texas state Senate have voted to fine Democrats $5,000 a day to force them to return to New Mexico from where they've been hiding. They've been hiding out in New Mexico to avoid voting on some bill. Republicans want to charge them $5,000 a day. Hey, if Democrats had that kind of dough, they'd be Republicans. Okay?'Jay Leno:&quot;And Fidel Castro had a birthday this week. 77 years old. He's got to be easy to shop for, huh? Cigars.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, the state -- now $38 billion in debt. This is unbelievable. You know, and here's how we solve it. And I'm surprised none of the candidates have done this. Here's what we should do. Have the state buy a gas station, okay? 48 hours later, we'll be even. Boom.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody buy gas this week? $2.20 a gallon for regular. $2.20. Didn't we win the war? Shouldn't it be like 50 cents?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Man, it was hot today, wasn't it? I'll tell you, I was sweating like Arnold Schwarzenegger trying to buy up all the back issues of 'Oui' magazine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apparently, 26 years ago -- so it's relevant -- I guess Arnold gave an interview with 'Oui' magazine where he talked about his sex life and all this kind of stuff. But the good news is, as you know, Arnold is married to Maria Shriver, and now that he's had a sex scandal, the Kennedy family has finally accepted him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Arianna Huffington says she wants to debate Arnold Schwarzenegger. I can't wait for that. It'd be like a bad episode of Boris and Natasha from 'Rocky and Bullwinkle.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Saturday, President Bush returned from his month long vacation. That's typical, isn't it? Bush comes back on Saturday, just in time for the big three day Labor Day weekend.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For the first time ever, a Newsweek poll shows that more Americans want President Bush to lose the 2004 election than want him to win. Sure sounds like it could be a repeat of the last election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, of course, the big excitement today, John Kerry officially announced he is a candidate for president. Exactly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't want to say Kerry's been having trouble getting the word out that he's running, but after he announced, his wife said, 'You're running for president?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Hinckley Jr. -- remember the idiot that shot President Reagan? Has gone to Federal court asking for permission to be able to go out on unsupervised field trips. He wants to be able to go out unsupervised. There's a good idea. Let's let him out in the middle of the presidential campaign. What do we got, ten candidates out there? Oh, yeah, there's just candidates all over. Oh, great idea. Perfect time, yeah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It looks like the US is heading towards another fight with France, this time over the US' intentions to lift all UN sanctions against Libya. Fight with France. Oh. I mean, what is France going to do? Threaten to hold their breath until they turn 'bleu?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to reports, Osama bin Laden had a big terrorism convention in Afghanistan. Honest to God. 5,000 people, they believe attended the terrorism convention in Afghanistan. And that by the way, is why you could not get a cab in New York City today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Federal insiders believe that the terrorism convention in Afghanistan went okay. It was okay. They said. But next year they are going back to Atlantic City.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you heard about this? Senator John Kerry from Massachusetts announced that he is running for president. What do you think? Yeah, okay. Don't kid yourself, the guy is desperate. Today he went in for a queer makeover.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;George Bush is starting to attack the economy. He gave a very forceful speech about the economy. You could tell he was serious because he kept pounding his dog on the podium.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But in the speech, Bush promised that his Administration will work to keep jobs -- will work to keep jobs. Yeah, his and Dick Cheney's.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's apparently a new audio tape from Saddam Hussein. Another recent audio tape from Saddam Hussein. He puts out about one a week or so now. You can tell it is recent because in it he congratulates Jerry Lewis on raising $60 million.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Saddam Hussein moves every two hours to avoid capture. Are you listening Martha? You hear what I'm saying? You could move every two hours to avoid capture.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have had a lot more shark sightings off the coast of California the last two weeks. These sharks, they're smart. Apparently, they can even smell Gray Davis' blood in the water.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, is it me or does Gray Davis look like he could be the third brother on 'Frazier?' Doesn't he? Doesn't he look like he fits right between Niles and Kelsey?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of political experts are now saying the governor's race is so close, that Gary Coleman could sneak in under the wire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love this story. A 1977 Arnold Schwarzenegger interview in 'Oui' magazine has surfaced. And in it, Schwarzenegger describes his fondness for marijuana and sex. You know what's really frightening to me about all this? That some guy still has a 26-year-old copy of 'Oui' magazine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier tonight, they had the big California gubernatorial debate. I love saying that word -- the big gubernatorial debate. And goobers are what these people are, aren't they? Some people are criticizing Schwarzenegger for not going. He's not going to this one. They say Arnold goes around telling people he cares and he's going to be great, and forget about everything he did in the '70s. Hey, it worked for George Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, I'm waiting for the next debate. I'm waiting for the next one when Arnold Schwarzenegger, Cruz Bustamante and Arianna Huffington all debate. I believe the topic will be the proper way to pronounce the word 'California.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Arnold, God bless him, out today trying to get the minority vote. In fact, earlier today, Arnold told a group of African American voters - 'I'll be black.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, the economy is still suffering, consumer confidence is at an all-time low. Gasoline prices, over two bucks a gallon. So in other words, President Bush, back from his vacation. Yeah, back on the job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see this over the weekend? President Bush dropped his dog Barney. Held the dog -- dropped the dog. First he chokes on a pretzel. Then he falls off a scooter. Now he drops a dog. How old is our President, 5?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And John Kerry running for president. You can feel the electricity in the air. Can't you?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Saddam Hussein, remember him? Well, he has released yet another tape. And this one is really different. Apparently, it's a bluegrass album.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Osama bin Laden's son has taken over his dad's operation. Let's hope it works out as well for him as it did for Uday and Qusay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A computerized face recognition system intended to spot terrorists has failed its first test at Boston's Logan International Airport. You know these things, they can automatically pick faces out of a crowd? I guess it's really embarrassing for the people who made the machine. Apparently, the computer kept going, 'You look -- I can't just place it -- Mark, Mike, Mohammed -- I know I know this -- I just can't place it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Federal judge has ordered the Ten Commandments be removed from the capital building in Montgomery, Alabama. Apparently, politicians are not comfortable walking past anything that reminded they shouldn't steal and commit adultery.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, today, they asked former President Bill Clinton about it. He said, 'Ten Commandments? I thought there were just nine.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the reports, Osama bin Laden has been holding a terrorism convention in the mountains of Afghanistan. It's crazy, isn't it? 5,000 terrorists attended, name tags, hello, my name is Muhammad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The highlight of the convention was the demonstration of the new suicide turban.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I understand it was a lot of fun. Convention goers had their pictures taken with Uday and Qusay impersonators.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought this was a good sign, returning to White House tours, they had suspended the White House tours for awhile. Now the White House tours are back. And any time you go down to Washington to visit, you can take the White House tour. It's a little different under the Bush Administration than it was the Clinton Administration. For example, the tour guides now, they no longer have to knock on the Oval Office door. 'Are you decent? Can I -- can we come in?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Arnold Schwarzenegger came under fire this week when it was revealed that he participated in group sex in the 1970s. When asked to explain, Schwarzenegger said, 'I'm a Clinton Republican.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, as Arnold Schwarzenegger was about to give his speech in Long Beach, someone in the crowd threw an egg at him, hit him. Hit him with the egg. But they said on the news, he went on and gave the speech anyway. Of course, he gave it. He's the Terminator, isn't he? I mean, how would that look? The Terminator gets hit with an egg and runs away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, today, Arnold called former President Bill Clinton. He wanted to see if he could get the name of a good dry cleaner.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, they had the first gubernatorial debate. They wanted people to see it so they had it at 4:00.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, in debates like this, there are no winners or losers, there's just losers, if you saw that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I understand, the other candidates in the debate, they wanted to put an empty chair on the stage to represent Arnold Schwarzenegger to make him look bad, you know, since Arnold wasn't there. Then they realized, 'Uh-oh, what if the empty chair wins?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what they're doing in the next gubernatorial debate? In the next one, which is on, what, on September 17th, the candidates will be given the questions ahead of time so they can think them over and then devise the best answers to please the audience. You know, that's not a debate, okay? That's called Hollywood Squares.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's an interesting twist on this stupid recall thing. In order to comply with the equal time laws, TV stations in California cannot run any Arnold Schwarzenegger movies between now and the election, because it would be like giving him free publicity. And because it would mean free publicity for Gray Davis, they cannot show the movie, 'Dead Man Walking.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gray Davis' campaign staff has come up with a strategy they say is guaranteed to make sure this recall thing is defeated. Very smart. What they're going to do is they're gonna have Gray Davis come out and endorse it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a little bit of a scandal regarding Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante, who is also running for governor. It seems he has accepted $2 million from one Indian tribe here in California. On top of $800,000 he took from two other bribes -- tribes. I'm sorry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I like that name, though, Bustamante. Doesn't it sound like some kind of push-up bra for Hispanic women? Put on your 'Bustamante.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The California Assembly has passed &quot;a bill that will allow illegal immigrants from anywhere, we're going to give you a California driver's license. ... If you come from anywhere in the world, you come here, don't need anything, give you a driver's license. I believe the name of the bill is Proposition 'We Give Up, We Don't Care Anymore.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US Army announced today it is in a race against the clock to capture Saddam Hussein. They're hoping to catch him before he dies of old age.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now there are reports that the White House is about to propose a $65 billion spending program for Iraq. See, I don't get this. I mean, if Bush wants to improve the Iraqi economy, why not just give them a tax cut?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Bush met with the Prime Minister of the Netherlands. There was one embarrassing moment at lunch. When Bush said, 'Now you're Dutch, does that mean we have to split the check?' And the guy goes, 'Yeah.' And he didn't understand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, whoa. What a rough crowd. They were horrible. They had just gotten back from egging Arnold Schwarzenegger.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, a political protester hit Arnold Schwarzenegger in the face with a raw egg. That's right, yeah, but -- here's the best part. Arnold says he didn't mind because protests like that are what makes this country great. That's what he said. That's what he said, yeah. Then Arnold ran the guy over with his Hummer.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, Arnold Schwarzenegger unveiled his new campaign slogan today. It's - 'Okay, who threw that?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The other day, Arnold Schwarzenegger got egged. Someone threw an egg at him. Yeah, at a campaign spot. Hit him in the shoulder. No, it wasn't about politics. Turns out it was just someone who had rented 'Jingle All The Way' and was still mad.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I tell you, it's really getting nasty. All the dirt is starting to come out about the candidates now. Arianna Huffington came out with a plan to lower property taxes. Yeah, don't pay them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Cruz 'Dances With Casinos' Bustamante. It turns out now he's taken $2.5 million from Indian tribes, and now his brother got a job as the new general manager of an Indian casino. What are the odds?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because of the FCC regulations during the governor's race, local TV stations here in California cannot show any of Gary Coleman's old TV show, 'Diff'rent Strokes.' Can't show 'Diff'rent Strokes,&quot;cause he is a candidate and it would give him free publicity. And for the same reason, they can't show that porn actress' -- Mary Carey's -- movies. Which I believe is also called - 'Diff'rent Strokes,' if I'm not mistaken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A bill allowing illegal immigrants from anywhere to receive a California driver's license was passed by the California state Assembly. And listen to this, as a bonus, if you snuck into California from the Middle East, they'll not only give you a driver's license, they'll throw in a pilot's license, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now according to USA Today, the price tag for rebuilding Iraq -- $40 billion to $60 billion. Why are we rebuilding Iraq? We still haven't rebuilt south central LA after the '92 riots.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In what political experts are calling a landmark moment in the campaign, Democratic presidential hopeful John Kerry broke down and cried at a campaign event the other night. Shed tears. Apparently, he'd been reading his latest poll numbers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, presidential candidate John Kerry said -- this is the quote - 'I will lead in a way that will bring the powers and force of the entire planet to solve the world's problems.' You know, maybe you should win a primary before running for exalted ruler of the planet earth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How's this for nerve? The House voted to approve Congress a big pay raise. Where is this money coming from, huh? Gee, take it out of that massive surplus, why don't you, pretty much.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The pay raise will bring the average Congressman's salary to $158,000 a year. So apparently, running the economy down into the ground pays very well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They say this money will stimulate the economy. See, it trickles down. You give a congressman 158 grand, eventually that gets into the hands of hookers, waitresses, bartenders. You see it all -- eventually it gets spread out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What was it, the Jets last night? They said the game was aired to our military bases in 165 countries. We were only on vacation a week, how many places did Bush invade? Are we at a 165 now?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know this story by now, a couple of days ago in California, Arnold Schwarzenegger is campaigning in Long Beach, someone lobs an egg on him. Bingo. Not to be outdone, Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante had himself pelted with a Spanish omelet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last weekend, President Bush dropped his dog Barney on the dog's head. You see that? Today Al Qaeda claimed full responsibility.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, anybody watch the other presidential candidate debate the other night? No, nobody watches it, no. Now, I don't want to say that it was boring, but I told my TiVo to record it and it said, 'Why?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Sharpton, Democratic presidential candidatem Al Sharpton said African Americans are tiring of the Democratic Party. He says it has to stop treating blacks as their mistress. Sharpton explained that a mistress is where they take you out to have fun, but they don't take you home. Is that really necessary, explaining to a Democrat what a mistress is? Hello? I mean, if anyone knows the definition of a mistress, I think it's a Democrat. Come on! Please.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, this week, the FBI posted the names and faces of four known Al Qaeda terrorists. They said it is critical that we catch these people before they make it to California and get their free driver's licenses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As I'm sure you know, Governor Gray Davis has signed a bill allowing anyone from anywhere to come to California and get a driver's license. And, you know, it's causing a lot of complaints. Especially among terrorists. They're very upset. 'Ahmed, have you seen my DMV photo? It is worse than my FBI picture. I cannot believe it!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And over the weekend, Mahmoud Abbas resigned as Palestinian prime minister. He resigned. He said he wanted to get out before the whole recall thing started. He said, 'I can't take it any longer.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, bad news for Arnold Schwarzenegger. You hear about this? He went to Beverly Hills today. He got hit with a Faberge Egg.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the big story here in California politics -- you probably heard about this -- Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante allegedly has taken $2.5 million from Indian tribes. All in quarters, by the way, did you know that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Arnold Schwarzenegger was asked to explain his way of fixing the California economy. Here's what he did. He hit himself with an egg and ran away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's getting ugly out there. The governor, the recall Governor, Gray Davis, was making fun of Arnold Schwarzenegger's accent. He said if you want to be governor of California, you have to be able to pronounce it. And so, this upset Arnold, and Arnold said to be governor of California, you should be able to govern it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many of you folks saw President Bush on the television last night with his speech about Iraq? Well, you know what he's asking Congress for, $80 billion to help rebuild Iraq. $80 billion. When you make out that check, remember there are two l's in Halliburton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said he needs that $80 billion to rebuild Iraq's infrastructure, to rebuild Iraq's economy, and to rebuild Iraq's electrical grid. And if it works in Iraq, then he's going to try it in this country, to see what happens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Honestly, I watched the President, I thought it was a pretty impressive speech, except for the part where he dropped his dog on its head.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it looks like the cost for rebuilding Iraq is estimated at $60 billion. But some good news. Today, the guys from 'Queer Eye for the Straight Guy' said they could do it for $40 billion.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sunday night, President Bush spoke to the nation about the war in Iraq. He said we're fighting the enemy in Iraq and Afghanistan so we don't have to meet them on our own streets, you know, driving around with a California driver's license.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't get this. Governor Gray Davis signed a bill allowing illegal immigrants from anywhere in the world to come to California and get a driver's license. Isn't that crazy? And they're also signing a bill next week to get phony proof of insurance. That's the next one.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, there's something wrong in the state when it's easier to get a California's driver's license than it is to rent a video at blockbuster. At least at Blockbuster you need two pieces of ID, don't you?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld said that people who criticize the President are encouraging our enemies and preventing us from winning. That's what Rumsfeld said -- people shouldn't criticize the government. Or was it Saddam who said that? I can't remember.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rumsfeld said we shouldn't criticize the President. In other words, Americans shouldn't criticize our government for attempting to give the people in Iraq the right to criticize their government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and, folks, if you're worried about taxes, don't be, listen to this. Apply for the new Arianna Huffington exemption. This way you don't pay any taxes at all until you run for governor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I didn't know this, Arianna is a Greek word for tax evasion. Did you know that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the LA Daily News, Las Vegas oddsmakers -- gamblers are picking Cruz Bustamante to win the gubernatorial election. How many casinos is this guy hooked up with?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know, Cruz Bustamante, who is running for governor here, he claims the millions of dollars he got from the Indian casinos -- he says no, no, that doesn't mean he's gonna offer any special favors just because they gave him a couple of million dollars, no. But today, he did say if elected, he will bring back the buffalo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Peter Ueberroth has dropped out of the recall race for governor. People in the state are shocked, they had no idea who he was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We can understand why Ueberroth dropped out. He pays his taxes, he doesn't take money from casinos, he's never had sex with three women at once, he can't compete in this race.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier tonight, the Black Congressional Caucus sponsored another presidential debate with the nine candidates, and Howard Dean said as governor of Vermont, he worked closely with the blacks in his state -- both of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US mint now is, they are making new $20 bills. Were you aware of this? Instead of being green and drab gray and black they are going to be peach colored. Honest to God. This is a fantastic idea, and the government is hoping that this will distract us from the fact that we have fewer of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Iraqis are now getting regular garbage pick up service. And I'm thinking 'Well, when are we going to get that here?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush, to help stabilize the situation in Iraq, wants $87 billion. Why is he asking us? He can get this in one Republican fundraiser.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The airlines say they're going to start testing a new color code system that would assign a color to each passenger before they board an airplane.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Next month, extra color is going to be added to our $20 bills by the Treasury Department. Do you hear about this?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Jazeera aired new footage of Osama bin Laden, blah, blah, blah. Did you see, another one of Osama bin Laden's audiotapes? It's the usual staff. Called Bush evil, called him the Great Satan, called him a warmonger. The same stuff we heard last night at the Democratic presidential debate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody watch the nine Democrats debate last night? Did you see it? Look, nobody watched this thing. One of the candidates was wearing a Darth Vader helmet. Did you see? Then I realized, oh, that was just Al Sharpton's hair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what happened this week back in 1850? California became a state. Back then -- don't get ahead of me on this. Don't get ahead of me. Back then, we had no electricity, no money, everybody spoke Spanish. Gun fights in the streets. It was just like today except, of course, back then, the women had real breasts. But other than that, it's very, very similar to now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the latest poll out just two hours ago, 55% of Californians support recalling Gray Davis. 56% if you count Cruz Bustamante.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's the big story. Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante no longer asking people to vote no on the recall. No on the recall. Now he's asking people just to vote for him. He's breaking with Davis and going after Davis' job. Gray Davis was so angry today, he took away Bustamante's driver's license.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Looks like we're getting closer and closer to capturing Osama bin Laden, bringing him to justice. Did you hear today? We think they may have him. Yeah, yeah. Apparently, he downloaded some Coldplay songs off the Internet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Peter Ueberroth, how many of you remember him? He was the commissioner of baseball, and also president of the US Olympic Committee when they had the Olympics in Los Angeles. Well, he was running for governor, now he's dropped out. So Peter Ueberroth dropped out. The guy who makes his living pretending to kill people, he's still running.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barbie dolls have now been banned by Saudi Arabia. It seems that Saudi Arabia's religious police believe the Barbie dolls threaten the morality of the country. It is OK to have 18 wives, but you can't have a Barbie.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush is asking for $87 billion for the people of Iraq. So I guess they must have some of those Boston priests over there, too, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Voters in Alabama rejected a $1.2 billion tax increase proposal. The governor said if it isn't approved, public schools will go bankrupt, police will be cut by one third, and thousands of prison inmates will be released early. So it will be just like California, but with less teeth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you've probably heard, Gov. Gray Davis is taking a lot of heat over making a joke about Arnold Schwarzenegger's accent. He said people who can't pronounce California shouldn't be governor. However, he'd still give him a drivers' license.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An Arizona man has been evicted from a cave in the national forest that he's been living in for the past 11 years. He got kicked out. He told the judge he didn't know it was illegal to live in a national forest. The judge said, 'What, are you nuts? What, have you been living in a cave for the last couple of years?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New York City now has an official beverage. Were you aware of this?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The hot weather's back. What was it, 95 today? It was so hot, Gray Davis was giving illegal immigrants free air conditioners. That's how hot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was sweating like Arianna Huffington at H&amp;R Block. That's how hot it was.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Governor Davis announced that this Sunday, he and former President Bill Clinton will campaign together in South Central, Los Angeles. As you know, Clinton is against the recall. In fact, for eight years, when he was President, whenever they asked him a question, he'd go, 'I can't recall.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, President Clinton's cookbook comes out today. Did you know he wrote a cookbook? No, he really did. He got recipes from all these celebrities and stuff. And, of course, since it's Clinton, every recipe features breasts and thighs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, as if California isn't screwed up enough, yesterday, a Federal appeals court gave a strong indication it may postpone the recall, because of problems with the punch card system. They accepted the argument that the punch card system results in five times as many errors as any other system. That's what they say. In other words, it's good enough to elect the president of the United States, not good enough to elect the governor of California. Basically a problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the latest report, the amount of pornography available in Iraq has increased since the end of the war by 200%. There's pornography everywhere. This is part of our new 'oil for porn' program, which sends our biggest export for theirs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Iraq's wrestling team will not be able to attend the World Championships in New York this weekend. Couldn't get a travel visa to the United States from Iraq. Couldn't get it. Yeah. See, you know what they should have done? They should have flown to Mexico, snuck across the border to California, get a free driver's license and drive to New York.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are reports now that retired General Wesley Clark may enter the presidential race. He may be the tenth Democratic candidate, which could be big problems for President Bush. I mean, Clark is a Rhodes Scholar, first in his class at West Point, and most importantly, he owns his own flight suit, doesn't have to borrow one. Yeah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;North Carolina Senator John Edwards says he will announce he's running for president on September 16th. This is what I love about this election. If no one listens to you the first 40 times you announced it, just announce it again on September 16th.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;China said today, relations between China and the US have been damaged. Damaged by President Bush and Congress meeting with the Dalai Lama last week. In fact, China is so mad, they're talking about recalling all their spies and stealing secrets from other countries instead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sesame Street and Merrill Lynch have teamed up for a program they call 'Investing Pays Off.' It's to teach 3-year-olds to 5-year-olds how to manage money. No, no. And if it works there, they're going to try it up in Sacramento.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Somebody in Florida won the $50 million lottery, but they never cashed the ticket and lost the money because the deadline passed. And here's the sad part. You know who it was? Al Gore got screwed again in Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't kid yourself, fall is in the air. Can you feel it? Earlier today, Arnold Schwarzenegger was hit with a pumpkin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a new video from Osama bin Laden. The thing I find disturbing, you can tell Osama, and he's just weird, but he's getting more and more video savvy, connected to the video world. There's a brief cameo by Johnny Depp.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've seen the video, and you know what I'm talking about, Osama looks good. He's got a shorter beard, there's less gray, looks like somebody had a queer makeover. That's what it looks like.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, I tell you, the circus doesn't stop. The Federal appeals court today postponed the recall election. Did you know this? Yeah. How screwed -- even our recalls get recalled.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Basically, the court ruled, this is what they said -- the California voters are now just as stupid as Florida voters. That's what they said. That was it, basically.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, but they did this because the court says the ballot machines are outdated and prone to error. How ironic is that? The Terminator getting screwed by the machines.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And all of the candidates were stunned by the decision. Arianna Huffington today she hasn't been this surprised since she found out her husband was gay. That's how unbelievable, it's true.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Governor Gray Davis, he said he welcomed the decision. That's what he said. He said, using the punch card machines wouldn't be fair to the people. And he has a point. After all, those machines had helped him get elected in the first place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you hear about this? President Clinton was right here in Los Angeles over the weekend. I guess he heard J. Lo was single again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now President Clinton was here in Los Angeles, campaigning with Governor Gray Davis against the recall. They campaigned at the AME Church in South Central Los Angeles. It's kind of embarrassing. The only black guy Davis knows, and it's Bill Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, Clinton addressed the congregation. He looked good. He could have been a preacher. He stood at the pulpit, ex-President Clinton stood on the pulpit and said, 'Let he among you who is without sin cast the first stone.' And then Hillary hit him in the head with a rock.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This recall campaign, boy, you know, it's just getting ugly. The mud slinging. Now the rumors about Gary Coleman. You hear about this? They say he has a drinking problem. In fact, every night last week, he was spotted at a different mini-bar, that's what they say.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gubernatorial candidate Mary Carey, you know, the porn star who's running. Don't confuse her with the pornographer, no, this is the porn star who's running. She is promising -- and this is her platform -- she says if she's elected, lap dances will become a legitimate tax-deductible business expense. Well, finally a tax break Democrats can support, here you go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here is an unbelievable story. Over the weekend, Immigration officials discovered an underground tunnel that goes all the way from Tijuana to the downtown Los Angeles Department of Motor Vehicles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the latest Zogby poll of American voters -- listen to this -- Al Gore right now, you know he's not running. Al Gore leads George Bush 48% to 46%. Isn't that incredible? Bush two points behind Al Gore. You know what that means? If the election were held today, Bush would win again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Doesn't look good, though. Bush's poll numbers appear to be slipping. If the election were held today, Bush has just a 4% lead over an unnamed Democrat. Which is pretty accurate, because most people can't name any of the Democrats, pretty much.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Saudi Arabia has banned Barbie dolls. They say Barbie dolls are immoral. Here's my question. What the hell are you doing with them?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, the religious police in Saudi Arabia are very, very strict. They said any man caught selling a Barbie doll will end up like Ken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Officials say they've now found the cause of the big blackout last month, that blacked out the whole East Coast of the US. They said it was caused by power lines sagging into a tree in Walton Hills, Ohio. They're blaming the blackout on a tree and today, President Bush said, 'I know those things are no damn good. That's why I want to chop them down.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, folks, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld has said that, since oil money will not be enough to pay for the rebilling of Iraq, Baghdad is now to develop a tourism industry. To help our Iraqi friends get started, we've come up with what we think are a few good tourist slogans, to kind of get them off on the right foot. I like this one: 'Iraq -- we put the 'Gee!' in jihad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Iraq -- come see what you're getting for your $87 billion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This one should make me people feel good. 'Don't worry -- all of our cabbies have California driver's licenses.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a nice postcard one. 'Iraq -- it's like Barstow, with oil.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Iraq, you tried Club Med. Now try Akmed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Iraq there are no strangers, just American-hating extremists who you haven't met yet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is kind of a nice one. 'Iraq -- we'll leave the lice on for you.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And finally - 'Hey, at least we're not Branson.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to the Tonight Show. Boy, you all sound like Gray Davis when he heard about the court recall, yeah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you, I had a disappointing last couple of days. That's what's good, we got this up crowd, 'cause the last couple of days -- Sunday, I was supposed to go to the Ben Affleck/Jennifer Lopez wedding. Then later in the day, I was supposed to go to the Peter Ueberroth for governor rally.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Secretary of State Colin Powell says he cannot speed things up in Iraq. Powell says Iraq is not ready for self-government. At the moment, it can't be trusted to run a fair democratic election by itself, you know? And apparently, neither can California.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, yesterday, a Federal appeals court postponed the October 7th recall election. Or as Gray Davis calls it, a stay of execution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The election is now put off until March, but recall supporters say they're going to ask the US Supreme Court to get involved. If the US Supreme Court gets involved, you know what that means? The next governor of California, George W. Bush, ladies and gentlemen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of the candidates are having problems already. Gary Coleman said today, running low on funds. Yeah, that's what he said. No, he said. He said he never should have let his parents handle his campaign money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Governor Gray Davis and President Bill Clinton campaigned at the Mexican Independence Day festival over the weekend. Davis brought a pinata stuffed with driver's licenses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Friday, a new cookbook written by former President Bill Clinton came out. Clinton wrote a cookbook. No, this is true. Think about that for a second. A couple of years ago, you'd ever think you'd see the day when Bill Clinton would be writing a cookbook,&quot; just &quot;the target of an ethics probe and possibly going to jail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the new Clinton cookbook here. It's all celebrity recipes. Can you get a shot? It is called 'Hey, How About a Little Pork?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a good one. This is 'Wonton Soup for the One-Ton Intern.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some remaining members of the Taliban in Afghanistan are now threatening to cut off the nose of anyone who listens to western music or shaves off their beard. If you shave off your beard, they'll cut off your nose. That would be awkward, don't you think? 'Cause whenever you shave your beard, people are going, 'Bob, you look different. Didn't you used to have a nose?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know something, it's not even logical. Why do they cut off your nose for listening to music? Shouldn't they cut off your ear if you listen to music? What if you smell something - 'That's it, we're cutting off your big toe.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about this Hurricane Isabel? 100,000 people on the East Coast getting ready to flee this Hurricane Isabel. It's unbelievable. But thanks to President Bush's economic plan, many of the businesses already have been boarded up so that people can leave early.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, a judge in California ruled that the state must postpone their recall election until March of next year. They've got to postpone it. Yeah. After hearing this, Gary Coleman was thrilled and said, 'This means I could be in the news two years in a row.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you very much. Welcome to 'Terminator 4: Rise of the Voting Machines.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, this stupid recall. They're now saying this delay in the elections is going to help Governor Davis because the longer the election delayed, the more Democrats come out and vote. Which -- see, I don't understand that. Why is it the later they make the election, the more Democrats come out? What, are Democrats like jazz musicians now, just late all the time?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The court said they stopped the recall, because the punch card system is way too confusing. How confused -- you take the card, you punch it. What part of that don't people understand? You know, if you can't figure out how to punch the hole, maybe you shouldn't be voting in the first place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, when she heard the news that the election was postponed, Arianna Huffington said, 'Does that mean I can stop paying taxes again?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Al Gore, coming to California to try and help the Gray Davis campaign. They make a pretty good team. Well, Al Gore and Gray Davis, you put those two together you almost have a personality.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier in the week, Governor Gray Davis and former President Bill Clinton made a joint appearance at an elementary school here in Los Angeles. Actually, it's kind of embarrassing. I guess Davis lost all the kids' lunch money and Clinton had sex with their teacher.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you know they named a school after President Clinton here in Los Angeles? This is true. The William Jefferson Clinton school. That's the name of it. In fact, at this school, condoms are not only free, they are mandatory.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can see the Clinton influence on the young people at this school. Like yesterday, one kid banged erasers and denied he did it. You know. 'I did not bang those erasers.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our first Constitution of the US will be on display to the public at the National Archives in Washington, DC. See, they're thinking this way, maybe Attorney General John Ashcroft will get a chance to read it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, retired General Wesley Clark announced he is running for President of the US. Pretty amazing guy. Four star general, graduated first in his class at West Point, supreme commander of NATO, served combat in Vietnam. What, he won the bronze star, silver star, the purple heart. Wounded in battle. See, I'm no political expert, but that sounds pretty good next to choking on a pretzel, falling off a scooter and dropping the dog.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Democrats now are very critical, because President Bush can't find bin Laden. Bin laden? Let's find Ben Affleck, then we'll get bin Laden. We can't even find Ben Affleck.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, a new audiotape surfaced in Iraq that is supposedly a message from Saddam Hussein. That's the latest, yeah, a message from Saddam. Yeah, the CIA thinks it may have been taped some time ago, because in it Saddam wishes Ben and J. Lo all the best.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week an appeals court in California ordered that the recall election for governor be postponed until March. They're gonna postpone this thing, yeah. That's right, yeah. Yeah, the court did this in order to give Arnold Schwarzenegger more time to learn how to pronounce 'California.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was so wet in Washington today, John Ashcroft ordered the Justice Department to put rain coats on all the nude statues. That's how bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Israeli officials say they have agreed in principle to getting rid of Yasser Arafat. They just aren't sure how or when. It's kind of like California with Gray Davis. We don't know when.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Ninth Circuit Court has ruled. You know, they ruled to delay the recall until March. Well, now they say they're willing to review the argument over again. See, the ACLU successfully argued the Florida punch cards are antiquated. So what? Florida voters are antiquated, aren't they? We didn't get rid of them. We didn't bring in new voters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, why can't we just vote by telephone? It worked for 'American Idol.' Why can't we do the same thing?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gubernatorial candidate Gary Coleman having trouble raising funds. Yeah. Yeah. He's now flying around California in a crate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday in an interview, former President Bill Clinton said he believes New Yorkers would release Hillary from her commitment to serve six years in the Senate if she wanted to run for President. I'm shocked. A Clinton who doesn't believe in commitment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Seattle voters voted overwhelmingly to reject a ten-cents-a-cup coffee tax. You know about this? A tax on espresso. A coffee tax? You know, I'm glad that got defeated. 'Cause if that had passed, there would have been riots, people tipping over BMWs, looting Pottery Barns, police are doing yuppies with pepper spray -- 'Get back!' Frightening thing that would be.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush spent the day at Camp David, and said he was preparing for Hurricane Isabel by 'battening down the hatches.' Bush then admitted he's now sure what that phrase means, but he heard it once on 'Popeye.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Israel announced this week that they want to expel Yasser Arafat because he isn't fit to be a leader. As a result, Arafat has announced that he is running for governor of California. He'll fit right in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, former General Wesley Clark announced that he was running for president, and right afterwards, his supporters handed out 'Clark Bars.' Yeah, and the promotion was so successful, Richard Gephardt is thinking of changing his name to 'Dick Butterfinger.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, yesterday, the hurricane forced Washington, DC, to shut down. And the Bush Administration sent home all nonessential government employees. Of course, nonessential to Bush would be the economic team, the CIA facts checkers, the environmental people.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I tell you, it really caused a panic down in Florida. Senior citizens down there haven't been this scared since the Republicans wanted to reform Social Security.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, there are now reports that France may agree to train Iraqi soldiers. Why? I thought Iraqis already knew how to surrender? Don't they? What's the problem?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, of course, Saddam Hussein has released another -- I'm getting tired of this guy. Have you heard the latest tape? It's the same thing -- Bush is a demon, Bush is an evil aggressor, Bush is Satan. Hey, let me tell you something, if this guy wants to insult our President and call him evil, he could join the Democratic Party and run for president like everybody else.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And General Wesley Clark announced he is a Democratic candidate for president. And apparently, Bill Clinton is advising Clark. Yeah. Although Clark already has been called into question for changing his story three times about a claim he made on Meet the Press. On Meet the Press, he said the White House called him right after 9/11 and pressured him to connect Saddam Hussein with 9/11, but he's changed his story three different times. So, I guess, Clinton really is advising him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And there is now a move, listen to this, there is now a move to get astrology approved by the Department of Education as an accredited college course. You'll be able to take astrology as your major, then you could look into the future and see yourself out of work, because you took astrology as your major.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But you see, as I look out and see all these candidates, I can't help but think how proud I am to be from Massachusetts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Only in California do we have more candidates than we do registered voters. You know, it's unbelievable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Arianna Huffington could not be here. As you know, she's at home. She's looking for receipts to pay her taxes, yeah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here was an odd quote made by Gray Davis the other day.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As I'm sure you know, last week, the LA City Council voted unanimously to ban lap dancing everywhere in LA. They can forget about us ever getting another Democratic convention in this town.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, you know, this Presidential campaign, it's barely started. It's getting mean and nasty. Dick Gephardt has an anti-Bush Website, called  http://www.a-miserable-failure.com. That's his Website. And today, President Bush reacted with his new Website,  http://www.i-know-what-you- are-but-what-am-i.com.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of excitement about the new Democratic frontrunner. General Wesley Clark -- very educated guy, did you know about this? Among other things, has a degree in philosophy. You see, in college, philosophy majors study the question, 'Is the glass half full or is the glass half empty?' See, this prepares for their careers later in life as waiters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A tough night for us, we did not win an Emmy last night. And not only that, but the one we won last year -- they're trying to recall.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Turning our attention to the world of global politics, Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf is in New York City today. Were you aware of that? Maybe you had trouble in traffic? He's speaking at the UN. And what are the odds of this, his cab driver's name today was Bob Smith.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Arnold Schwarzenegger has a new campaign slogan, you know what it is? It's 'Join me.' That's the new campaign slogan for Arnold Schwarzenegger.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And over the weekend, Gray Davis was in the gay section of San Francisco, which, what section is that, actually? That's what they said on the news. And he said, this was his quote, he was happy to be in the 'hood.' Is there a 'gay hood?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush spoke at the United Nations today. Bush said the nations of the world need to be more united than ever. Yeah, they are, against us.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush also met with French President Chirac for lunch. He's trying to improve our relations with France. There was one kind of embarrassing moment when Bush asked Chirac if he'd like more 'freedom fries.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, last Thursday, France said it would be willing to help the US in Iraq. It would give us some support. Boy, the French work fast, huh?

And if that works, they're going to help us get Baby Jessica out of the well.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Dick Cheney reportedly suffered severe chest pains today. It's not a heart attack or anything like that, he just heard gas was under two bucks a gallon again. He can't take it. It's just too much.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Democratic Presidential candidate John Kerry came down pretty hard on fellow Democrat Howard Dean this weekend. After Dean misspoke several times, Kerry said you can't misspeak 15 times in a week and be president. And today, Bush said, 'You can't?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a Newsweek poll, just a few days after entering the race -- you know this general Wesley Clark guy, he is already the Democratic frontrunner. He's number one. And according to the polls, if the race were held today, Clark and Bush would be a virtual dead heat. And in a related story, Bush announced he's calling General Clark out of retirement and sending him to Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Time magazine reporting that Bill Clinton has been telling Hillary in private he wants her to reconsider and run for president. And I think Bill will be supportive. In fact, he told her, 'Don't worry, honey, I'll be fine. You go on the road for a year. I'll be fine.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the FBI, a man has been jailed in Atlanta for trying to break into the cockpit of an airliner. This same guy was arrested for a similar incident in 1987, but the FBI is emphasizing he is not a terrorist. What does that mean, he's a hobbiest? Is that what it is?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to polls, retired General Wesley Clark now leads all Democratic candidates. If Clark, do you know Wesley Clark? Have you seen him? If he looks familiar, I believe he is the same guy in the Lipitor ads.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The other Democratic candidates are getting worried. Joe Lieberman is worried about the popularity of Wesley Clark. Today, he replaced his wife with Bonnie Hunt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And George Bush was in town. He was going to go over to the UN and make a big speech at the UN. And before his address to the General Assembly, he met with Kofi Annan, you know, or as Bush likes to call him, 'Rico.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are reports now that Saddam Hussein is in hiding and he is running out of hair. Crazy? I'm sorry, did I say Saddam Hussein? I meant Martha Stewart.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, they had the big debate tonight, the candidates. You know this debate with Arnold and Cruz and all these people, they get the questions beforehand. What is that? Even Miss America contestants don't get the questions beforehand. It's like jeopardy for dumb people, this stupid thing.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Arnold Schwarzenegger did say as governor, he would offer a tax amnesty, to which Arianna Huffington said, 'Hey, got my vote.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Bush spoke to the UN and asked the world to help Iraq write a constitution. Today, John Ashcroft said, 'Constitution? What's that?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush's approval rating has fallen to its lowest levels ever. Not good. Let me tell you, it's going to be very tough on President Bush if he's a one term President. I mean, sure, his father was a one term President, but at least his father got elected once.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, this is something that's just got people furious. A judge in Oklahoma has postponed the implementation of this national do not call list. Did many people sign up for this thing? Well, you gave your number to them and now they say, 'No, that's it, it's unconstitutional,' they cannot implement that law. The judge says the telemarketers can call you whenever they want. You know what we should do? Let's all call this judge tonight at home during dinner. All right, let's find out his number, give him a call. Idiot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can tell that it's autumn in New York because yesterday, President Bush got a chilly reception.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, they've got like a dozen Democrats now, and looks like this retired General Wesley Charge is the frontrunner, he comes from like two weeks ago, he wasn't in the race until bang now of a sudden he's the frontrunner, and you know, it was, I guess he owes it all to the queer makeover.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier tonight there was a debate of the California gubernatorial candidates, and this was the first debate that Arnold Schwarzenegger has participated in. And he insisted that the final debate segment be the clean and jerk.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, last night, the California ship of fools made its maiden voyage. Did you watch that thing? How many watched the debate?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It got pretty raucous. The crowd started getting out of control a couple of times. Luckily, the security guard, Gary Coleman, was able to calm them down.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now let me ask you something, from watching that debate last night, was it me or was there some weird sexual tension between Arianna Huffington and Arnold? Could you feel it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Arianna kept interrupting Arnold, attacking Arnold, going on. I think I know why her husband turned gay now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, of course, the big rumor going around now is, I guess she alluded to this last night, that there are naked pictures of Arnold Schwarzenegger floating around left over from his body building days. Oh, how awful for Arnold, huh? What was he, Mr. Universe seven times? If it was me, I'd be handing out the pictures.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's just hope there aren't any naked pictures of Cruz Bustamante floating around.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a lot of people wanted to know why Mary Carey -- you know the porn star? The adult film star -- why she wasn't there. Actually, she was there. She was there. You couldn't see her, 'cause of that new law in Los Angeles, that the strippers have to stay at least six feet away from the guys.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was interesting, at one point, the moderator slipped up and addressed Arnold as Governor Schwarzenegger. Did you see that? Yeah, yeah. Even more embarrassing, when he called Cruz 'Chief' Bustamante.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was watching last night, I finally figured out who Cruz Bustamante is. I think he's the fourth Pep Boy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bustamante keeps talking about this tough-love policy for California. That's what he calls it, tough love. Don't confuse that with Gray Davis' policy, that's tough luck. Yeah, tough luck.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the one thing all the candidates did agree on, this is interesting, they all want to make California business-friendly. As opposed to what it is now, illegal immigrant and celebrity murder friendly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to a new CNN poll, President Bush's approval rating has dropped to its lowest level ever. The President's rating is now at 50%. The last time Bush had a score of 50%, he was taking his finals at Yale.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know former Congressman James Traficant? You know the guy that's in prison? He went to prison? Well, he was running for president from prison. He's now ending his campaign for lack of support. He said he will return all donations. His campaign war chest included three Luckys, two Camels, a pack of Marlboros.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You hate to see this. The US Air Force airman, this guy who worked at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba -- did you hear about this? He's been arrested for attempting to pass along military secrets in Syria. Been charged with espionage, aiding the enemy, disobeying orders and credit card fraud. Now, aren't the first charges serious enough? You're a traitor to your country, you betray your fellow soldiers. You put everything you know and love in danger. Do you have to throw in the credit card fraud, too?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I don't mind the other stuff, but when he went to Circuit City and bought the plasma TV, that was it for me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The city of Seattle has a program now to help the homeless. It includes teaching them how to make espresso. It sounds like the Republican solution to a major problem, doesn't it? We're going to teach unwed mothers how to play polo, too, now. We feel that would help.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A strip club in Detroit is now offering to pay the college tuition of any college girls who work at the strip club. They work there and they'll pay your tuition. College girls working as strippers. Which I believe -- wasn't that part of President Clinton's after school program?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You folks been watching the survivor show on the CBS network? Anybody? They have a grocery clerk. They have a former Marine. They have a lawyer, they have a bartender -- they have a mortician. Sorry, those are the Democratic candidates for president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Arnold Schwarzenegger got into a huge debate with Arianna Huffington about immigration. They were going back forth and back and forth, and finally immigration came in and hauled them both away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But for the Democratic presidential candidate, you know who the frontrunner is now? This retired General Wesley Clark. Are you familiar with this guy? If Clark looks familiar, he is the guy on the Fixodent commercials saying, 'Now can I eat corn on the cob.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wesley Clark is being coached by former President Clinton. Yeah. I believe this is the first time a general is being advised by a pot smoking draft dodger.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know at the gubernatorial debate Wednesday night, I thought Arnold Schwarzenegger stayed pretty cool during Arianna Huffington's attacks. See, apparently he is still under orders not to kill any humans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think I figured out why Arianna is running as an independent, I don't think any party wants her.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And what was with Cruz Bustamante? He seemed kind of out of it, didn't he? Just kind of floating along. Apparently some of those Indian tribes must've donated some peyote toward the campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, President Clinton is now denying that he is endorsing General Wesley Clark. They thought he was, but no. You know the difference between General Clark and Clinton, anybody know? See, the General knows how to control his privates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, God bless Bruce Willis, he's over there entertaining the troops, he took his band over there. And Bruce Willis told the troops in Iraq, he will offer a one million dollar bounty for the man who captures Saddam Hussein. And he offered two million dollars for whoever brings him the head of Ashton Kutcher.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Starbucks is finally opening a store in France. You know it's very hard to get an American store over there because the French are very protective of their culture and their customs and their food. It took Starbucks years; in fact they kept Starbucks out longer than they kept Hitler out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US government will introduce a new $20 bill that will be peach colored. Not surprisingly this announcement came after a visit to the treasury by the cast from 'Queer Eye for The Straight Guy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the latest Democratic presidential debate, Dennis Kucinich said he's stop the death penalty, cut the defense budget and setup a department of peace. He made the remark after being asked the question of 'Why is it you have no chance of winning?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some political news out of Russia today. It seems the leader of Chechnya is okay, after someone tried to poison him just days before the big election. And today, California Republicans said, 'You can do that?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Two suspected Al Qaeda militants have been arrested in Pakistan. They were arrested at an Internet cafe. Let me tell you something. If these guys were downloading music, they are in big trouble.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The LA Times had a big story about how hard it is to cut off the money that funds these terrorist organizations. See, this would be a great job for Governor Gray Davis. Put him in charge of Al Qaeda, they'll be broke in a week. All their money will be gone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Bush Administration now asking Congress for $87 billion to help rebuild Iraq. On Meet The Press, National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice said, 'You can't put a price tag on security.' Well, I guess you can. It's $87 billion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After Lockheed Martin named its new warship the 'Seablade,' Navy officials said the name sounded too gay. That's what they said, it sounded too gay. Then Lockheed had to change the name. You know, the Navy's worried about things sounding too gay. How about getting rid of the rank called 'rear admiral?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House now has disputed allegations by members of a House Intelligence Committee that President Bush went to war with Iraq based on vague intelligence. Well, of course he did. Everything he does is based on vague intelligence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a recent article, the Bush campaign is convinced the election of 2004 could be won or lost on just a handful of votes. Those votes would be Sandra Day O'Connor, Clarence Thomas...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have director Quentin Tarantino on the show tonight. I love this movie. He's got his new movie out called 'Kill Bill,' which, if I'm not mistaken, was the original title of Hillary's book.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Martha Stewart is in trouble with PETA -- you know, the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals -- for frying soft shell crabs alive in a frying pan on her show. PETA asked her how would she like it if someone did that to her, and today, the Justice Department said, 'We're working on it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know John Edwards, the Democratic candidate, running for president? This is his book, 'I haven't heard of me either.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And former President Bill Clinton has a cookbook out. And here it is right here. This is number one. It's called, 'Careful, This Zipper's Hot.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, George W. Bush has asked Congress for $87 billion to rebuild the New York Jets. Did you know that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, anybody here from California by the way? How much longer do you suppose that will be a state, California?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it's amazing, Arnold Schwarzenegger is now the frontrunner in the polls. He is the run away leader in the polls. Isn't that remarkable? As a matter of fact, Arnold is so confident that he is posing naked again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to US intelligence, Saddam Hussein is in hiding. I guess we knew he was in hiding. And he is running out of hair dye. And they say he is so desperate that last night he sneaked into west Baghdad for a queer makeover.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Governor Gray Davis visited a retirement center in west Los Angeles. I'm not sure if he's campaigning or looking for a place to live after next week.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And reports say that Arianna Huffington is threatening to drop out. Oohh-h-h. Isn't that like Saddam Hussein threatening to commit suicide?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can tell Arianna's campaign's starting to lose momentum. Like today, she called Schwarzenegger and said, 'Hey, were you serious when you said you had a part for me in 'Terminator 4?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's now being reported that when Cruz Bustamante finally got his college degree in 2003 -- you know he just got his college degree now? 30 years is a long time to go to college.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Presidential candidate Howard Dean is on the show tonight. You know, it's interesting. Well, I'll tell ya, see...here's the thing. We wanted to keep it a secret, but somebody in the Bush White House leaked it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House has denied that President Bush's chief political strategist Karl Rove was involved in leaking the name of a CIA officer to a reporter in order to intimidate her husband. You following this story? They said, 'This is simply not the way the White House operates. The campaign staff, yeah.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dean is &quot;a medical doctor, a politician and a Democrat. So he has three reasons to tell women to take their clothes off now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Presidential candidate Wesley Clark said yesterday he believes that technology will one day make time travel possible. He wants science to develop time travel, where people can go back in time. He wants to turn back the clock, so maybe he really is a Republican.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The bad news is the unemployment rate is expected to increase next month by like a million people. But the good news, they're all telemarketers!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, yesterday, President Bush signed the do not call bill. And this bill has caused a lot of controversy. This is nothing new, this do not call thing. You know, Hollywood has had a do not call thing for years. I think Pauly Shore is on it. Carrottop's on it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, I don't understand why these Democrats dislike President Bush so much. I mean, according to a new report, more than a million people sunk into poverty last year. That's a million more Democrats Bush has created.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wesley Clark, &quot;two weeks ago he announces. Now he is the frontrunner. Listen to this. Over the weekend he is at a Democratic fundraiser and he is explaining how he believes in the time travel. Paging Al Gore. Paging Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So today, Clark time traveled to the Democratic convention and found out that he wasn't nominated because of stupid time traveling remarks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In California, &quot;Arnold Schwarzenegger is so confident about winning this election that he is having group sex again.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the big story in Washington continues to be this leak of this CIA agent's name. You been following this story? Anyway, someone leaked the name -- and President Bush is furious. He told his staff today, he said, 'This one time, I want the truth and I want the truth now.' And they told him, 'Okay, you lost the election, you're not really President.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as you know, President Bush wants $87 billion for Iraq. $20 billion of which is going to rebuild their roads, their railroad bridges and their public buildings. You know, is there any way we can get California to declare war on the US? You see, Bush could invade us, we could lose and we get money for our railroad bridges, our public -- you see what I'm saying?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Arianna Huffington has pulled out of the California gubernatorial race. Yes. Yeah, that's what California needs, another unemployed alien, great, great.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She had less than one half of 1% of the votes. That's what she had in the polls -- one half of 1%. Now most polls have a margin of error of 3%. So she may have had a negative -- she may owe us votes. Do you realize that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She said today she pulled out of the race to do something important -- to prevent Arnold Schwarzenegger from being governor of California. I think she's being modest. I think she did something far more important. She proved she could not be governor of California.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's now being reported that when Cruz Bustamante finally got his college degree in 2003 -- he just got it this year, his college degree -- he received credit for a class he never even attended. Yeah. But he said it wasn't an important class. I think it was just ethics or something.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Doesn't look good for Cruz, either. Even the Indian casinos are betting against him now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you're starting to see a lot of negative ads about Arnold now. They're all kind of ganging up. But, you know, Arnold can take it. You know it's interesting, all his critics say he's not an administrator, he's an actor. He's not an environmentalist, he's an actor. He has no government experience, he's an actor. And Arnold's thrilled. For the first time in his career, critics are calling him an actor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After Lockheed Martin named its new ship the 'Sea Blade,' the US Navy complained, because it said the name sounded too gay. That's what they said. The Navy made them change it. You know, if this is a new trend in the military, getting rid of names that sound gay, I think the next one should be Fort Dix, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And how about North Carolina, Seymour Johnson Air Force Base? Hello?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the stock market was up today. Went way up. In fact, Martha Stewart actually made money legally today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have to tell you something, you are here on a great night. The entire balcony is filled with exposed CIA agents.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new frontrunner is former General Wesley Clark. He is at a fundraiser last weekend. He tells people there that he believes it's possible to time travel. Travel at the speed of light. That's what he tells them. As a matter of act earlier today he went back in time to remove his foot from his mouth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And also Clark said he won't be campaigning this weekend. He will be at Ford's Theater saving Abe Lincoln.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Cheney is building a bomb shelter. Building a bomb shelter. Our Vice President going to have himself a bomb shelter. I was thinking to myself gosh, if the guy is serious about surviving, how about having a salad every now and then.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Arnold Schwarzenegger's wife, Maria Shriver, announced that, after next week's election in California, she will return to work at NBC. That's what she said, yeah. Meanwhile, Gary Coleman announced that, after next week's election, he'll return to work at KFC.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It warmed up a little bit today, wasn't it? I tell you, I was sweating like Rush Limbaugh at the Apollo Theater. That's how hot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, that's the big story. Rush Limbaugh has resigned from ESPN as a football commentator over racially insensitive remarks he made about quarterback Donovan McNabb. At first, he said he wouldn't back down and then he quit, he quit. See, Cubs' manager Dusty Baker was right, these white guys, they can't take the heat. You see what I'm saying?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear Rush's excuse? He now says he was so high on painkillers, he doesn't know what he was saying.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, that's the other big story with Limbaugh now. He's being accused of abusing large quantities of prescription drugs. He was turned in by a former housekeeper who said she supplied him for four years. Four years. You know, if you're selling somebody drugs for four years you're not the housekeeper, you're the drug dealer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, folks, in less than a week, the election will be over and all this recall stuff will be behind us. Yeah, and I tell you, we'll go back and the most embarrassing thing about California will once again be the San Diego Chargers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, what do you call a Californian who can't figure out how to punch a ballot? A Florida voter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The latest wrinkle in this whole recall thing -- six women have come forward to say that over the last 30 years -- 30 years -- they come forward just days before the election -- to say that Arnold Schwarzenegger groped them without their consent. Again, this proves he would be a hands-on governor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Six women over 30 years, or as Clinton calls that, Thursday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now Arnold said this is a last-minute attack by Democrats. And here's my -- how did Arnold know to grope only Democrats?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, of course, all the other candidates are jumping on this, they're all attacking him now. Like today, Cruz Bustamante said that during the debate, he caught Arnold staring at his cleavage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's not the only one. Today, two women came forward to say they had their legs humped by Gary Coleman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Governor Gray Davis, God bless him, he doesn't have these kind of problems. In fact, he said today, he has never even groped his own wife, so there you go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Arianna Huffington said she will devote 100% of her time -- she is devoting all her time now to make sure that Arnold loses the next election. In fact, she's come up with a sure-fire way to ruin his campaign, she's going to endorse him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Gray Davis has a new campaign slogan -- help!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To give you an idea how unpopular Davis is, today, he called the prisoner on death row to pardon him -- the guy wouldn't take the call.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante, he just got his bachelor's degree from Fresno State, the college, this year. Just got it this year. And like most recent college grads, his prospects look bleak. He may have to move back in with the folks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in Washington, Republicans are now saying President Bush has no idea who leaked this CIA agent's name to the press. See, you got to feel sorry for Karl Rove and Bush's handlers on this. I mean, for the last couple of years, what have they been telling us? 'The President's in charge, he makes all the decisions, nobody makes a move without his say-so.' Now their only defense is, 'He's out of the loop. He's Bush.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Pentagon has contracted for a $40 million helium filled balloon, a giant blimp. It's 25 times the size of the Goodyear blimp, will be part of our homeland defense. This huge blimp. Yeah, this is true. Good to know we're spending this much on security that can be brought down with a bow and arrow basically.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rush Limbaugh &quot;made controversial remarks about Philadelphia Eagles quarterback, Donovan McNabb, and he resigned his job. And he's out of a gig. I'm thinking it's too bad, because Rush was looking so good after that queer makeover.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know the Democrats. There's about a hundred Democrats that want to be president, and they all seem to be about the same. And then retired General Wesley Clark comes along and he's the frontrunner. Do you know General Wesley Clark? Are you familiar with him? Yeah. He's a good looking guy. He's at a fundraiser and tells people he believes in time travel. Paging Al Gore. Paging Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So right after the fundraiser, he tells people he believes in time travel, excuses himself and goes back to warn General Custer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some bad news for Arnold Schwarzenegger. The LA Times accuses Arnold Schwarzenegger of groping six women. Six women. I'm telling you, this guy is presidential material.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's what was odd about that. The LA Times accuses him of groping six women, and out of habit, Hillary Clinton forgave him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, the Los Angeles Times broke a huge story that quoted six women that claimed that Arnold Schwarzenegger sexually harassed them. Yeah. Yeah, when asked about it, President Clinton said, 'Six? That's not enough experience to be governor.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a huge story, though, and a couple of hours ago, Arnold Schwarzenegger apologized for 'behaving badly.' And said that from now on, he will be more respectful of women. It's true, yeah. In fact, Arnold promised that in the next Terminator movie, instead of saying 'I'll be back,' he'll say, 'You're not fat.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Arnold Schwarzenegger's wife, Maria Shriver, announced that, after next week's election in California, she will return to work at NBC. That's what she said, yeah. Meanwhile, Gary Coleman announced that, after next week's election, he'll return to work at KFC.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well folks, here in California just four more days until we find out if there's going to be a 'Terminator 4!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Guess you heard the latest. Bad news for Arnold, six women have come forward to say that Arnold groped them without their consent. But the good news for Arnold, today Bill Clinton is now endorsing him.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This woman who now claims Arnold groped her thirty years ago, now coming forward. Thirty years ago, or as the 'LA Times' calls it, breaking news!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The woman claimed that Arnold told her he'd like to Cruz her Bustamante.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the smear campaign continues, today there were allegations that Arnold once admired Hitler. And the odd thing is, Hitler is now three points ahead of Gray Davis in the polls.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, it was all a misunderstanding; Arnold said he was never a fan of Hitler. And today Pat Buchanan said, 'Well that's it, he's lost my vote.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Gray Davis today, God bless him, said he had nothing to do with these stories coming out about Arnold. And if this doesn't hurt Arnold in the polls, he'll have nothing to do with the next two stories coming out either.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you, you know who's really getting lost in this recall race is Cruz Bustamante. In fact he was so desperate for attention today he fondled himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Rush Limbaugh had to resign from his football commentator job at ESPN because of those racial comments he made. See I don't think ESPN even gets it, today they named Rush's replacement. Did you see who they hired? Trent Lott. That seems like a step backwards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is going to Las Vegas, his first time as President. It's his new economic plan. A billion dollars on red! Hey, he might as well try it, nothing else is working.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see Bush's speech today? President Bush said today that free countries do not develop weapons of mass destruction. And Rumsfeld's going, 'Shut up!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, the Bush Administration is having this big scandal about a leak. See that's the big difference between Democrats and Republicans right there. Republicans have leaks, Democrats have stains.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the Administration said today they remain confident that we're going to find bin Laden and Saddam Hussein. We can't even find Kobe Bryant, where is he?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dr. Laura Schlesinger says in her new book, that women should look at their husbands as gifts from God, and they should give them sex whenever they want. I believe Hillary is writing the rebuttal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's Friday, it's a big day for President Clinton. His protege, Wesley Clark, is doing well in the polls, and Halle Barry is now single.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The people of California are just desperate. If Arnold&quot; Schwarzenegger &quot;can't change the state they're going to change over to Iraqi rule.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, of course, you know, today is Yom Kippur. It's a day set aside for atonement, except in California, where it's a day set aside for liable, slander and defamation of character.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Are you all ready for the big election tomorrow? I'm still not sure who to vote for. You know what I'm saying? You got Arnold, who groped a few women. Or Davis, who screwed the whole state.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Arnold revealed his health care plan. Every woman gets a free breast exam.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, now I know why they call this election a recall. Suddenly women are going, 'Yeah, I know he touched me 30 years ago. I just recalled it now.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More allegations about Arnold came out today. Turns out he was at a Democratic fundraiser a few years ago, which his wife, Maria, made him go to, because she's obviously a big Democrat. And, I guess, as Arnold reached under the table to touch a woman, he felt Clinton's hand coming from the other side.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While campaigning Saturday in Merced, California, Arnold made a surprise visit to an In and Out Burger. You probably saw that on the news. You see, now, this is where you need advisors. If I was Arnold after these allegations, avoid any place called 'In and Out.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are really split on this thing. Like Jamie Lee Curtis, you know, Jamie Lee Curtis, the actress. She said when they made the movie 'True Lies,' Arnold -- perfect gentleman. Although Tom Arnold said he did grab his breasts. So I don't know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Gray Davis, he told reporters that Arnold Schwarzenegger's behavior towards women warrants a criminal investigation. And then he had to leave to go meet Bill Clinton for a campaign rally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Arnold is not the only one. Today, six inflatable women claimed they were groped by Cruz Bustamante.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the subject of race was raised today. When they asked Arnold about it, Arnold said, 'Race does not matter.' He said, 'Underneath, we are all cybernetic organisms, living tissue over metal endoskeleton.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know what Gray Davis is going to be for Halloween? Unemployed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A civilian translator in Guantanamo Bay was arrested last week -- you probably saw this -- at Boston's Logan airport for possible espionage. He was searched. In his possession, a copy of a CD-Rom, and it was marked 'secret.' What kind of moron steals a document and then writes the word 'secret' on it? I mean, if you don't want anybody to look at it, don't you put, like, 'John Tesh Live?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This morning I'm coming in, I'm listening to Ozzy Osbourne on the radio. You all know Ozzy, right? The guy with the history of abusing drugs and saying outrageous things. Oh, no, it was Rush Limbaugh.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, a lot of people on that Rush Limbaugh diet. You have tried this? It's Vicodin for breakfast, Oxycontin for lunch and then a shake for dinner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pretty ironic, isn't it? The only Republican with a prescription drug plan, and it's Rush Limbaugh. The only guy. You get, like, 5,000 pills a year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, today Rush said he would have no comment on his drug problem until he could figure out how to blame it on the Clintons.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeff Lurie, &quot;owner of the Philadelphia Eagles. ... Well, he is furious that ESPN would hire a man with Rush Limbaugh's views on minorities. You know, he got fired for making those comments. He said, 'There's no place in the NFL for racism.' And then, Sunday, he told his team to go out and beat the hell out of the Redskins.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A guy here in New York City in like a one bedroom apartment or studio apartment has a 400 pound tiger. 400 pound tiger. ... They crawled up in a window above the tiger and they shot him with tranquilizer darts, and then they were able to put him in a net and carried him out of the building that way. I believe is the same way that ESPN got rid of Rush Limbaugh.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last minute, all of this trouble, and Arnold Schwarzenegger, the campaign they have the new slogan, are you aware of it? Win one for the groper!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Los Angeles Times reported that Arnold was groped by six women, that was the official count, six women. Two more gropes and he's an honorary priest.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, of course, is the election day in California, or as we call it here, the People's Choice Awards! Yeah!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you love the recall, you're going to love the recount. That's what I have to say.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's amazing, they say this could be the largest number of people that have voted in California since 'American Idol.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The polls are not closed, we don't know who won yet, but tonight, Gov. Davis will find out if he still has a job in Sacramento. And, of course, tomorrow, Gary Coleman will find out if he still has a job at the mall.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Voting in Beverly Hills is so strange. My polling place is also a tanning booth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;135 people on the ballot, and still, nobody to vote for, you know? This election is like satellite TV, there's 500 channels, there's nothing to watch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's the big thing now, these high-tech, touch screen voting machines they have now. See, the good thing about those is, the nice thing is, you get to touch Arnold for a change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, on talk radio, they've been comparing Clinton and Schwarzenegger -- you know this whole thing, like, 'Oh, what's the difference between the Clinton women and the Schwarzenegger women?' I'll tell you the difference, about 200 pounds. That's about the difference.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not sure Arnold has learned from this controversy. Like at a campaign stop today, he was kissing a baby while it was breastfeeding. That seems wrong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And some of the charges are so ridiculous. Like today, six more women came forward, claimed they were rear-ended by Arnold's bus, so I don't know what that means either.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Arnold had to address these charges against him regarding the improper behavior towards women. He now blames it on a faulty computer chip. Yeah, that was replaced.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Cruz Bustamante went into the voting booth, pulled the lever to shut the curtain, won a $25,000 jackpot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now there are charges against the Green Party candidate. Peter Camejo, the Green Party guy? Apparently 25 years ago, he groped a tree. Did you hear about this? Now he claims he was just hugging the tree, but the tree says no, he was pulling on the limbs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's one thing about Cruz Bustamante, never heard any charges like this against him. I think the only breast Cruz ever fondled was in a bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Florida Senator Bob Graham dropped out of the Democratic presidential race. Yeah, he dropped out. Yeah, down to nine. He said he didn't think he could get a majority of the country to vote for him. Today, George Bush said, 'So?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Federal Government has a new proposal. They want to put surveillance cameras on commercial airline flights to prevent trouble. The theory being, surveillance cameras will scare away the bad guys. Yeah, that works so well at 7-Eleven.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's how dumb I am. I've heard so much about the Arnold Schwarzenegger and the Gray Davis. And for some reason, I wake up and go looking for a high school gym to vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Arnold Schwarzenegger is very shrewd. This morning he tried to expand his lead by groping minorities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the business bureau, in the last five years, the population of California has decreased by 250,000. In the last five years, a quarter of a million people have left California. I can't wait until tomorrow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They were able to shoot&quot; the 400 pound tiger found in a Harlem apartment &quot;with tranquilizer darts and then trapped him in a net and hauled him off. It's the same method they use to get Arnold Schwarzenegger off movie sets.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As I'm sure you know, Arnold was declared the winner last night, just one minute after the polls closed. 8:01. So see that, Florida, at least we can count.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We can now tell every other state that our governor can kick your governor's ass.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Arnold announced his first official act as governor, deporting Arianna Huffington.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush called Arnold to congratulate him today, and after he got off the phone, Arnold said, 'I thought my English was bad.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll be honest. I had a couple candidates I was considering. Gary Coleman, he was on my short list.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, now that the recall is over, my wife made me finally take down the 'Mary Carey for Governor' sign we had in the front yard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former Governor Gray Davis spent the day today revoking the driver's licenses of all the illegal aliens who didn't vote for him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was very hard for Gray Davis to compete against a Hollywood personality. Two reasons. He's not from Hollywood and he has no personality.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This past weekend, voters across the state got a recorded phone message from Bill Clinton. ... Even though it was just a recorded message from Clinton, if a man answered, the phone message would hang up, just like the real one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cruz Bustamante was the big winner yesterday. Apparently, earlier in the day, he went to the casinos, bet all his money on Arnold.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, you know, it wasn't even close. In fact, Bustamante lost so badly -- you know what his Indian nickname is now? Custer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, he will be Lieutenant Governor. And he said he's going to cooperate with Arnold. His theory is, 'If you can't lick them, join them.' And Mary Carey said, 'If you can't join them, lick them.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said today -- he told reporters, rather, he has no idea if we'll ever find out who leaked information about a CIA operative to the press. We'll never know. Why can't we find anybody these days? We can't find who leaked the information. We can't find Saddam. We can't find Osama. Do you realize at this rate, OJ's going to find the real killers before we find anybody.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's some good news. Turkey has agreed to send 10,000 troops to Iraq as peacekeepers. But see, I think President Bush still a little confused about foreign policy. Like he said today, 'I appreciate their support, but I realize how important it is to get Turkey's troops home by Thanksgiving.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During his acceptance speech last night, Arnold said -- this is a quote - 'I will not let you down.' That's right, yeah. Unfortunately, at the time, Arnold was holding a woman over his head and looking up her dress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a speech after the election, Arnold Schwarzenegger said, 'I came here with absolutely nothing, and California has given me absolutely everything.' That's right, yeah. Very nice, yeah. Meanwhile, Gary Coleman made a speech saying, 'I came here with nothing, and I still have nothing.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A toy company announced this week that it is coming out with a Muslim version of Barbie. That's true. The company says the Muslim Barbie comes with a car she's not allowed to drive.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Boy, you can really tell it's fall, can't you? You know, today, I saw Rush Limbaugh storing up painkillers in his cheeks for the winter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Rush Limbaugh said he can't talk about the prescription drug scandal he's involved in, because he said, 'I don't yet know what I'm dealing with.' Hey, it didn't stop him from talking about black quarterbacks. Doesn't know anything about that either, does he?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Kobe Bryant blamed all his troubles on 'rowdy room service.' ... Doesn't look good for Kobe. I think Gray Davis had a better week than Kobe pretty much.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Workers moved the Liberty Bell to its new permanent location. And President Bush was furious when he heard there was a crack in it. He said, 'We will find the evildoers who did this! We will track them down!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a speech in New Hampshire, President Bush defended the war in Iraq saying, 'I was not about to leave the security of the American people in the hands of a madman.' So I guess he's firing Donald Rumsfeld. Is that what's happening?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday, in her speech, Condoleezza Rice said right up until the end, right up until the end, Saddam Hussein harbored ambitions to threaten the rest of the world with weapons of mass destruction. Up until the end? What end? There's no end. He still has a TV show on Al Jazeera, doesn't he?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the latest report from the US military says they still have not found any Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. However, today, they did find several Iraqi women who claim they were fondled by Arnold Schwarzenegger in the 1970s.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush called Arnold yesterday to congratulate him. Arnold was very polite. He thanked Bush for the economy. Because let's face it, he couldn't have won without that Bush economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And during the news conference yesterday, Arnold said he would ask President Bush for a lot of favors. And today, the oil companies said, 'Hey, get in line! No cutting! We're first!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The porn actress, Mary Carey, you know the one that was running for governor? She was actually on the ballot, the porn star, Mary Carey. Got over 10,000 votes. So apparently a lot of guys were pulling for her.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you know there was a guy on the ballot named George Schwartzman? And he also got over 10,000 votes. I think people may have voted for him thinking they were voting for Arnold. You know, I didn't realize there were that many people from Florida living in California.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I went to Arnold's victory party the other night. You know, I was lucky I got in that thing. Security was unbelievable. In fact, everybody was patted down by Arnold himself as they came in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They even brought in an extra security guard, Gary Coleman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And former governor, former Governor Gray Davis' wife Sharon said that she was a flight attendant and she knows what it's like to be sexually harassed. And today, Frank Gifford went, 'Sharon?' Yeah.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cruz Bustamante will still continue to serve time under Arnold. What kind of workout regiment is Arnold going to put him on?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is unbelievable. Utah Senator Orrin Hatch is now working on legislation to change the Constitution of the US to allow foreign born citizens to run for President. This is what I love about Republicans. They're 100% against giving immigrants driver's license -- you can be president, that's okay, but you just can't drive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A huge scandal today with the Homeland Security Department. The agency's inspector general said that airport baggage screeners were given the answers in advance to their job tests. Given the answers in advance. Like they're Ohio State football players.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know how to make sure these guys really inspect the luggage? Make them get on the plane. Okay? Check the luggage, then make them ride on the flight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about this controversy with Britney Spears? Did you hear about this? I love this. Apparently, the wife of the Governor of Maryland said if she had a chance, she would shoot Britney Spears. She is so upset about Britney Spears' influence, she said, 'I would shoot Britney Spears.' Well, now she's apologized, saying it was just a figure of speech, she said she meant nothing by it. How many think an apology isn't good enough? How many would rather see them kiss and make up?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Listen to this, here is how strange life can be. One day you are Governor of the state of California, and the next day you are in Long Beach running Gray Davis Pontiac.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But you know Arnold says that while he's governor, he won't make I any more movies. No more movies. I'm thinking to myself, maybe we can get Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez to run for office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Executives in Hollywood are upset because now that Arnold is Governor, he has no time to make movies. That's right, yeah. In a related story, Ben and J. Lo are being urged to run for President.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a recent press conference, Donald Rumsfeld said that he had no idea that the US was reorganizing the leadership structure in Iraq, and that nobody had consulted him. Yeah. Yeah, Rumsfeld was furious and said, &quot;I'm tired of being treated like President Bush.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the latest on the big Yankee-Red Sox rivalry -- Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy and New York Senator Chuck Schumer made a bet -- and this is the bet -- the loser has to wear the other team's hat. That's the bet, yeah. Yeah, Senator Kennedy isn't worried, because they'll never find a hat big enough to fit his giant head.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To celebrate Columbus Day and commemorate the day, our Governor Gray Davis gave driver's licenses to everyone named Nina, Pinta or Santa Maria.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know how Columbus discovered America? You know how he did it? Anybody know? He was drawn by the light from the Indian casinos.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In all the Sunday morning news shows yesterday, all the talk was how to control Don Rumsfeld. How do we control Don Rumsfeld? And the people are saying, 'Don Rumsfeld? We can't even control Don Zimmer.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush vowed, vowed to weaken Fidel Castro's hold on power. I didn't even know Cuba had oil. Did you know that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, President Bush says he wants to increase the number of Cubans allowed into the US, and he says he's willing to help Cubans find safer routes to enter the country. I believe the first two routes are the American League and the National League.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know President Bush has been traveling around the country giving speeches on how well things are going in Iraq. He says there are schools opening every day. Okay, they're terrorist training schools, but hey -- at least the kids are learning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On his Christian Broadcasting Network, Pat Robertson said the US State Department should be blown up with nuclear bombs. That's what he said. Pat Robertson said we should blow it up with an atomic bomb. I guess he just asked himself, 'What would Jesus do?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, Rush Limbaugh admitted he has a drug problem. Apparently, he ran out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rush Limbaugh admitted he is addicted to painkillers, and, over the weekend, checked himself into rehab. And fellow conservative William Bennett gave him five-to-two odds he's going to make it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, there's an investigation into it, now, because I guess he got the drugs illegally. They say Rush could go to prison. You thought he was against gay marriages before. Whoa!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Arnold Schwarzenegger's announced he's going to ask President Bush for help, and what better way to deal with a $38 billion deficit than get advice from a guy that created a $450 billion deficit?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To help raise revenue for the state, Arnold Schwarzenegger vowed to rewrite Indian casino deals for California. Going back on a deal with the Indians. Has the white man ever done that before?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new report, the recall cost the state of California $66 million, but ended up bringing in $107 million in revenue. It actually made money. You know what that means? If we can recall a governor every two months, in a year, we'll be fine. We'll be fine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the A&amp;E Network announced they are making a movie about the California recall. I guess Gary Coleman auditioned -- this is true -- Gary Coleman auditioned for the part of Gary Coleman, but they gave it to Emmanuel Lewis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And happy anniversary to the Clintons. Bill and Hillary celebrated their wedding anniversary over the weekend. Yeah, they celebrated quietly -- you know, not talking to each other.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have some good news. This weekend, Mom, my Mom, my Mom did a great deal of soul searching and she has decided to stand by Rush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congratulations to our old friends, former President Bill Clinton and Senator Hillary Clinton, they've been married 28 years. It's their 28th wedding anniversary, that's right. This weekend, 28th wedding anniversary. Bill celebrated by going out and getting laid.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know we have a bus and train strike here in Los Angeles. It's so bad, listen to this. Illegal aliens have no way to get to the DMV to pick up their free driver's licenses. It's awful.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Dick Cheney has given another speech linking Saddam Hussein with the terrorist attacks of 9/11. Now, didn't President Bush already say that Saddam Hussein had nothing to do with the terrorist attacks? Here's my question -- whatever turns out, Dick Cheney is the dumb one? Ah! How frightening would that be?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush wants to make it easier now for Cubans to get into the US. And I think his heart's in the right place, but, you know, sometimes his solutions can be a little simplistic. Like, now, he's asking all Americans to throw their used tires into the ocean.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush says he is now working on a plan to destabilize the Cuban economy and drive it into huge deficits. He knows this works, because he's been testing it here since the day he took office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government says the US medical community is ready for quick response in the event of a biological attack. A quick response, unless, of course, you have an HMO.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congressman Dennis Kucinich from Cleveland has officially announced that he is running for president of the US. And, girls, he's single. Do we have his picture? There he is. There he is. Ladies, he's single. Yeah. Running for president. If elected, he would be the first bachelor president since -- well, since Bill Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to today's New York Post, Arnold Schwarzenegger will probably be the keynote speaker at the Republican National Convention, which is very smart, see, 'cause after Schwarzenegger speaks, Bush's English won't sound so bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In one of his final acts as Governor, Gray Davis has signed a bill that would create a marijuana card. Do you know about this? The marijuana card? Look, suddenly, the band wakes up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The marijuana card. So medical marijuana users can smoke without fear of arrest should carry this card. Of course, the hardest part for most dope smokers is remembering to bring the card.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Indonesia considering drafting a new set of laws that would outlaw both extramarital sex and witchcraft. Witchcraft and extramarital sex would be against the law. Well, that's like Bill and Hillary's worst nightmare.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an upcoming interview with Barbara Walters, Martha Stewart says prison is the last place she wants to go. You know, after Kmart, of course.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Osama bin Laden apparently now has turned the running of Al Qaeda over to his son. He's got a son now who is in charge of Al Qaeda, and the kid's name is Gary, is it? But the kid says that he will be more accessible than his father is what he said, and he told his followers, he said, 'My cave is always open.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now US authorities believe that Saddam Hussein is actually hiding in his hometown of Tikrit. This is fascinating when you think about it, how the world works. One day, you've got 12 palaces, and the next day you're living with your parents, Mort and Adele Hussein.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What do Cubs' fans have in common with Arnold Schwarzenegger? They should learn to keep their hands to themselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the most recent Gallup Poll, this is interesting, Bush's approval rating has risen to 56%. The stock market is up. The economy is doing better. See, that's the good thing about these baseball playoffs. Bush gets so distracted, he can't screw anything up. 'Leave me alone. I'm watching the game.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House now has a big PR campaign to convince the nation that things are going well in Iraq, but their slogan is not the best: 'This is not your father's Vietnam.' Bad slogan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush says he wants to help Cubans find easier routes to the US. Right now, of course, the easiest way -- go to Mexico, follow the crowd pretty much.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our new Governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, said today that he will seek financial help from Washington. The bad news? We're second in line behind Iraq. Yeah, so good luck. It's going to be a while.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And last night, and God forbid, I hate talking about people when they're not here, but last night's the audience was rough, rough crowd last night. Here's what happened, during the program they were using their cell phones to order prescription painkillers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's this foul ball, and you saw it, and they say that a kid may have prevented&quot; the Cubs' outfielder &quot;from making the catch. ... And then security hustled the guy out of Wrigley Field, and the Bush Administration believes now that he is hiding in the mountainous region between the Afghanistan and Pakistani border.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rush Limbaugh is in rehab, and am I, am I the only one that thinks we were better off with him sedated?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Limbaugh's housekeeper &quot;calls the National Enquirer and she said that she delivered enough prescription painkillers to kill an elephant. Wow. Well, apparently not.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Isn't it stupid that they're threatening this guy [the Cub fan who interfered with the foul ball]? I mean, they're really threatening him. Nine millionaires give up what? Seventeen runs in 2 games, and they blame the fans. That's like Gray Davis blaming the recall on Gary Coleman.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I thought this was very nice. You know who sent condolences to the Cubs today? Al Gore. He said he knows what it's like to get screwed in Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today, Arnold Schwarzenegger met with President Bush. Arnold told President Bush he was born in Austria. I think, you know, Bush gets a little confused. He said, 'Well, then I'll throw another shrimp on the barbie for ya.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, this week, China sent its first man into space. Pretty amazing. Experts say China's space program is just intended to direct people's attention away from the country's economic problems. Hey, beats going to war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to reference experts, we still don't know exactly what kind of chemicals Saddam Hussein may have had. Hey, we don't even know what kind of chemicals Rush Limbaugh had.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see Newsweek magazine, their story? They said Rush Limbaugh's home was worth $30 million. Isn't that amazing? With a street value of $80 million.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Governor Gray Davis has signed a bill that would create a marijuana card that would allow medical marijuana users to smoke marijuana without fear of arrest. All they do is show the card. It's a marijuana card. Their slogan is, 'Everywhere you've forgotten you've been.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Maybe you can tell. I'm a little on edge. I'm a little jumpy. I'm a little kind of beside myself. Today is my first full day of prescription pain killers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh is addicted to prescription pain killers and went into rehab. He has been in there three or four days. Apparently he is doing unbelievably well. Earlier today he announced his engagement to Elizabeth Taylor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to rumors, now Saddam Hussein is being hidden by relatives in his hometown. Wait a minute -- now that's that Chicago cubs fan who tried to catch the -- forget that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday in California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Governor-elect met with President Bush. It's amazing if you think about it. It was the 'Terminator' and the 'One Terminator.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a recent interview, Martha Stewart said she is 'scared about going to prison.' Yeah. Yeah, not surprisingly, her future cellmate said she's even more scared.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Chinese astronaut that took off this week is back on earth after 21 hours in space. Oh, 21 hours. Hey, I've been on Southwest flights from Burbank to Reno that took longer than that. Shut up. 21 hours.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is kind of scary. Today, three suspicious bags filled with clay-like material, bleach and box cutters were found on two Southwest Airline planes in New Orleans and Houston. That's the bad news. That's the bad news. The good news, we have been so successful in cutting off the terrorist funding, they're now forced to fly Southwest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;National security adviser Condoleezza Rice got into a little trouble today when she referred to President Bush's stop in Japan as a layover. She called it a layover, which angered the Japanese. In fact, they were so mad, they were steamed at Rice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's more proof that President Bush is in complete control of the White House. You know, I want to show you this in the paper. This is the Philadelphia Inquirer. I want you to read this quote. I think this is wonderful. Can you get in tight there? Says President Bush told his senior aides Tuesday, he didn't want to see more stories quoting unnamed Administration officials in the media anymore, and if he did, there would be consequences, said an Administration official who asked that his name not be used.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're now saying Tom Arnold may run for Governor of Iowa. I guess he got turned down for the center position on 'Hollywood Squares.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel sorry for that kid who went to the Cubs game and tried to catch the foul ball in game number six. ... But according to the latest reports, the fan is being hidden by Baath Party loyalists in the town of Tikrit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rush Limbaugh, you know Rush Limbaugh? Yeah. He got fired at ESPN and it turned out he was using prescription pain killers, Rush Limbaugh. Now he is in rehabilitation. It's going pretty well. It's interesting. One minute you are Rush Limbaugh, you are a great conservative radio talk show host. And the next day you are standing in line with other patients waiting for Daryl Strawberry's autograph.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, the Yankees won last night, and because the Yankees were losing until after midnight -- true story -- the New York Post mistakenly printed an editorial saying that the Red Sox had won. It was printed in today's paper, yeah. Not surprisingly, the editorial ran next to a story about President Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, big announcement, Ashton Kutcher announced that he has decided to back Senator John Edwards for president. He's throwing his political might behind Edwards, yeah. Yeah, when asked why, Kutcher said, 'Cause his mom is really hot.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about this? Apparently, government officials raided a bunch of Wal-Marts. Found over 300 illegal immigrants, or, as we call that on our border, a slow Monday, basically.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the good news -- every one of them had a California driver's license, so there you go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big scare last week at Southwest Airlines when bleach was found in the lavatory of two of their airplanes. What does that say about the cleanliness of airline toilets? When they're going, 'Bleach? We never clean the bathrooms, it must be terrorists.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The head of the FDA says America's prescription drug supply is the safest in the world. Well, yeah, now that Rush Limbaugh is in rehab, duh.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Washington, DC, the Senate voted 97-0, 97-nothing, for an anti spam bill, those annoying email things you get on you computer. Yeah, I think that's very good. The Senators made it very clear that, when you start misleading the American people and start taking money by making promises, that's our turf, buddy, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last week, a guy jumped over Niagara Falls and lived. Did you see this guy? He wasn't in a barrel or a suit. Just, in his clothes, jumped in, lived. He said he jumped because he was depressed and now he feels just fine. You know, let's just hope your HMO doesn't hear about this new cure for depression, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This past week, Kmart introduced their latest commercials with the new Kmart slogan: 'Kmart -- your last chance to see Martha before she goes up the river.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, folks, as I'm sure you probably know, the White House is on a big PR campaign to try to convince the American people that things in Iraq are going great. We're doing fine. Don't worry about it. Things are on the right track. In fact, the White House has been kicking around a few new slogans to try to get people behind this. This is some of the ones they're experimenting with. Like this first one, 'We didn't get Saddam, but we sure as hell got his statues.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Or this one - 'Iraq, it's everywhere you don't want to be.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is my personal favorite -'Hey, it got Geraldo out of the country for a while, didn't it?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And finally, the one they're going to go with - 'Hey, got goat?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight, here in our studio audience tonight, the entire balcony was picked up at a raid at Wal-Mart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now we know how they can sell everything for such low, low prices. They weren't paying anybody.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you all remember to set your clocks back for daylight savings time? I like daylight savings time. The only bad thing is, when you get out of work, it's dark now. Unless, of course, you live in a state that's on fire!&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In world news, President Bush said today that people attacking our forces in Iraq are getting more and more desperate. They're getting desperate, because we're making so much progress over there. That's the Bush philosophy. The worse it gets, the better it is. Sure, it's hard to follow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now Bush said the attacks in Iraq are intended to cause people to run. And he's right, at last count, there were nine Democrats running against him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush also said that part of our problem in Iraq is that Syria and Iran are not doing a very good job of keeping people from crossing their borders. Gee, why don't we send some of our experts from California over. I bet they could probably teach them, you know .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of that, you hear about this today? 10,000 illegal immigrants ran across the border from Mexico. You know what that means? Wal- Mart's hiring again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In California, you've probably all heard about this. Wildfires are still burning out of control and destroying thousands of acres of trees. Losing a lot of forest there, yeah. Yeah, but everything's going to be fine, because this morning, Governor-elect Schwarzenegger told residents, 'Don't worry, I played a fireman in 'Collateral Damage.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In other celebrity news this week, Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston traveled to the Middle East to bring Israelis and Palestinians closer together. Yeah, and it seems to be working, because the Israelis and Palestinians keep going up to each other, saying, 'What the hell are they doing here?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you heard, yesterday, President Bush declared California a disaster area, while saying everything is going well in Iraq. Pretty fair when California's now a bigger disaster than Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Governor Gray Davis said today, this fire may be the worst disaster the state has ever faced. So, the good news for him, at least he move downs a notch.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was so smoky today, I stopped at a Wal-Mart, I couldn't see the illegal alien in front of my face. That's how smoky it was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you heard, Federal agents are raiding Wal-Marts after they caught them using undocumented workers from Europe. You know, let me tell you, you know, the rules are very clear. If you're from Europe and you want a job here in America, you can just run for governor of California like everyone else.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today in Washington, Governor-elect Arnold Schwarzenegger had lunch with Senator Ted Kennedy. Arnold and Ted having lunch. I understand Gloria Allred, now representing the waitress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many watch that stupid new 'Joe Millionaire?' You been watching this thing? Well, I guess they tricked these women into believing this cowboy guy has something like $80 million worth of oil. Some of the girls don't really seem to be into him. However, when they heard he had $80 million worth of oil, both Bush and Cheney proposed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On An American Airlines flight the other day, an alligator got loose in the baggage compartment. An alligator on the plane. How does an alligator even get passed airport security? Apparently, it wasn't carrying any nail clippers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Senate has voted to ease travel restrictions to Cuba. They're doing this to make it easier for Steinbrenner to send some of his players back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They had a big parade yesterday in Florida for the world champion Marlins. Did you see that? ... They threw a ton of confetti. Well, it wasn't confetti, it was old dangling chads they had left over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Governor-elect Arnold Schwarzenegger is paying a visit to President Bush in Washington, DC. And I was thinking about this. Yeah, I think now is a great time for him to be leaving California, nothing really big going there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, the post office announced that it's coming out with a brand new stamp honoring Dr. Seuss. Oh, good. Very nice. Yeah, after hearing about it, President Bush said, 'Finally, an author I'm familiar with.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday, they said these fires may be the work of arsonists. I don't think President Bush quite understands this. Like today, he told reporters, 'It's wrong to hate all the followers of arsonism just because a few arsonists have done something bad.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush also says the increase of attacks on our forces in Iraq is proof that we're making progress. He also said the increase in global warming shows they're doing a better job of cleaning up the environment. And the fact' we're paying more and more for prescription drugs just proves our healthcare system is in great shape. So it's nice to see everything is looking good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And earlier today in Washington, our Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, met with Vice President Dick Cheney. So 'The Terminator' met 'The Defibrillator.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The difference between Schwarzenegger and Cheney is when Cheney grabs a chest, it's his own.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, yesterday, Arnold Schwarzenegger met with Sen. Ted Kennedy. Did you see the two of them standing next to each other on the news? Looked like one of those before and after ads for the 24 hour fitness centers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, Schwarzenegger went to Washington to meet with President Bush and get some money for California. Then after the meeting, he took Ted Kennedy to lunch. Feeding Ted Kennedy? How much did that cost?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, after the bill came, Arnold had to go back to President Bush to get more money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the nation's Capitol today, but it shows you what a heightened state of alert everybody's on. The House office building shut down, shut down after two people passed through a security checkpoint with a gun. Turns out it was just a toy gun, part of a Halloween costume. Shut the whole place down. In fact, President Bush and Cheney searched the knapsack ten times, they are convinced the guy had weapons of mass destruction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You all ready for Halloween? I understand Donald Rumsfeld dressing up as a guy who thinks the war in Iraq is going well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the Smoking Gun Website, the Unabomber, Ted Kaczynski, remember him? Complaining about his prison mail. The nerve of this guy? He claims the prison doesn't pick up his mail in time. Well, duh, if your job was to pick up the Unabomber's mail, would you hurry?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, Governor-elect Arnold Schwarzenegger is in Washington, DC. Yeah. It's pretty exciting, don't you think? He and Ted Kennedy went to lunch. Yeah, your state is on fire, what do you do? A three martini lunch with Ted Kennedy. That's what you do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's an interesting time. Arnold is in Washington, DC, and this is the first time a former Mr. Universe has been to Capitol Hill since Janet Reno.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Public schools in California are so strapped for money that they are dropping foreign language classes now. Gonna drop them.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US economy grew by seven percent last quarter. That's the biggest increase in twenty years. Of course the White House is taking credit for it. Today, President Bush landed on an aircraft carrier dressed as an accountant.&quot;</SPAN></P>

This woman, this mom with three kids in a Toyota crashes through security as he's getting into his limo, drove the car right into the building 40 feet away from President Bush. In fact, the minute it happened, Donald Rumsfeld declared all Japanese cars weapons of mass destruction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;40 feet. 40 feet away. In fact, the last time Bush had this close a call, he needed the Supreme Court to bail him out. It was that close.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love this story. In Orlando, Florida, the last of four people convicted of stealing moon rocks from a NASA safe and trying to sell them were sentenced to eight years in prison. You know, these have got to be the dumbest crooks ever. Selling moon rocks. Who's not going to know a moon rock is stolen?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a new report out today saying that the disease that President Franklin Delano Roosevelt had may not have been polio. That's what they said. He may not have had polio. How bad is his HMO, huh? You get the test results back 58 years after you're dead. 'Hey, good news! Mr. President, you might not have had polio. Yeah!'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;CBS is taking it off the network, but they're moving it to Showtime. So, apparently, you can libel and slander people, as long as it's on cable.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A frightened CBS has decided to drop their Ronald Reagan miniseries after claims by Republicans that it was historically inaccurate. That's what I love about Washington. It's okay to make up stories about weapons of mass destruction, but lie about dialogue on a TV show - 'Oh, oh, oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa, over the edge.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But to be fair, some of the scenes were definitely, made up, like that one where Reagan goes on the blind date with Trista. I don't remember.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who I feel sorry for? James Brolin, the actor who plays Ronald Reagan. I feel sorry for him. He's bossed around by conservatives at work, and ordered around by a liberal at home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Gov. Davis visited fire damaged areas of California yesterday. President Bush empathized with the residents, and he said, 'I can't imagine what it's like to have lost everything.' To which Gray Davis said, 'Hey, I can.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said the devastation was terrible. He said, 'What a shame all those trees were destroyed before the logging companies could come in and cut them down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But he did say, 'On the bright side, with the annoying trees out of the way, we can finally drill for oil, so thankfully, there's a good side.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean taking a lot of flack for his recent comment, where he said he wants to be the candidate for guys with Confederate flags on the back of their pickup trucks. That's what he said. And now Dean, now he says he regrets any pain those comments may have caused. And he said, 'And I mean it, too.' He said today, 'Hey, I'm not just whistling Dixie.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In his new book, 'Winning Back America,' Howard Dean talks about his wealthy prep school and how, when he was younger, he liked to get drunk. Let me get this straight. He had rich parents. Drank a lot, went to prep school, avoided Vietnam. He's the alternative to George Bush?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mexico's President, Vicente Fox, is in Phoenix, Arizona, giving a speech. He told Americans it's time to reform immigration laws and make it easier for his people to legally cross the border. Easier? What does he want, moving sidewalks?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President of Sri Lanka has suspended his country's parliament, fired three top government officials and ordered the troops to surround all government buildings. And today, John Ashcroft said, 'Why didn't I think of that?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fox has canceled its new series called 'Skin.' That was the show about the adult pornography industry. It was canceled after three episodes. Yeah, Fox canceled the show under pressure by Democrats, who said it wasn't an accurate portrayal of the porno industry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The CBS miniseries on Ronald Reagan has been pulled because it is too controversial. That's too controversial, but they had no problem with the Hitler movie?'</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, listen to this. At the Democratic presidential debate, they asked all the candidates if they had smoked marijuana.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess there's a there's a big Howard Dean fundraiser tonight, $500 a plate, but you have to pay with Confederate money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you heard CBS has taken their miniseries about the Reagans off the network, and they're putting it on Showtime, where less people will see it. But now, well, Republicans say that is not enough. They say they want to put it on the CBS morning show, where no one will see it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They've taken it off network and put it on cable. What does that mean? Cable? We're gonna see the Reagans naked now? I don't want that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This whole controversy is unbelievable, 'cause everybody's mad. Conservatives are asking how CBS could've made the show. Liberals are asking, 'Oh, how could CBS cave in like that?' And Jessica Simpson is asking, 'Who's Ronald Reagan?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Martha Stewart is upset, too. She's upset they pulled The Reagans off the air, because it was inaccurate. That's CBS's official line. 'It was inaccurate.' But they allowed the movie about Martha Stewart to be broadcast. Well, I can see why she's mad. She's Martha Stewart. Reagan was only President of the United States.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in a new interview with Barbara Walters airing for ABC's 20/20, Martha Stewart says she believes she believes she will be exonerated. So she's still getting inside information.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Treasury Department announced there are plans to redesign the nickel. Well, thank God. Why? Why are we redesigning is this to thwart counterfeiters? Are there bogus nickels being passed around out there? These bogus nickels are costing Americans over $1.25 a year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Howard Dean, in a recent interview, he admitted that he used to drink and smoke pot. So now all he needs to put him over the top is a sex scandal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been reported that ever since Arnold Schwarzenegger was elected governor, Schwarzenegger impersonators have been making as much as $400 an hour. Yeah. Which is a lot, considering the real Gary Coleman only makes $4 an hour.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barbra Streisand is reportedly furious that CBS has canceled its Reagan miniseries, starring her husband, James Brolin. She's furious. Yeah, furious.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Howard Dean told a group of voters in Tallahassee, Florida, this week that Southerners need to quit basing their votes on race, guns, God and gays.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as you know, CBS has canceled its miniseries, 'The Reagans,' after complaints that it portrayed Ronald Reagan as nothing more than a bumbling B-list actor controlled by a domineering wife.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Russian scientists now say it's possible for a human to conceive and give birth to a child in outer space. And Gray Davis said today, 'Any child born in space will get a California driver's license.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a press conference yesterday, Mexico's president, Vincente Fox, mispronounced our new governor's name. Called him Arnold Schwartzen-burger. Arnold Schwartzen-burger. That was an insult to every single person who lives in Calee-forneea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know these allegations about Arnold. 'Yeah, the groping. Yeah, remember the touching?'

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an interview with Barbara Walters, I think it aired tonight just an hour ago on 20/20, Martha Stewart says she doesn't know why people hate her.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear the news former New York City Mayor Giuliani is thinking about running for governor. Did you hear about that? That's exciting. He's serious about this because he is already posing naked and having group sex.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More bad news for President Bush. According to a new survey in Newsweek magazine just out this week, 50% of Americans would not vote to reelect President Bush.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And former Vice President Al Gore gave a blistering speech where he accused President Bush of undermining civil liberties. Well, it wasn't really a blistering speech. He was in his backyard, pretending the rake was microphone.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, Air Force fighter jets scrambled to intercept a privately owned plane that flew too close to the White House. Luckily, it was a false alarm.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know about that, right? CBS canceled that Reagan miniseries, canceled it. But CBS said they did not cave into pressure from conservatives. Now, you know what the 'BS' stands for in CBS.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, Kucinich the only bachelor running for president. Did you know that he's a bachelor? He said this during the debates, he's looking for a single dynamic woman who likes underdogs. Which, let me tell you, it's tough dating when you're running for president.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;CNN admitted that they planted a question in the Rock the Vote debate last week. You know that Rock the Vote where the kids the kids get to ask the kind of the questions? CNN planted a question. Seems they gave a college student from Brown University questions they had written. Yeah. Luckily, it was a Democratic debate, so, you know, nobody saw it. But, you know, if anybody had watched it could have been terrible.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Democratic candidate General Wesley Clark said today he has a plan for catching Osama bin Laden. Osama bin Laden? He can't even catch Howard Dean. What are you talking about? Please.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, Clark says he has plans to deploy Saudi Arabian commandos to catch the terrorist. The only problem is the Saudi Arabian commandos are the terrorists. Yeah, that's kind of the main problem with Saudi Arabia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush has blamed the problems over there on foreign groups that have arrived in Iraq with the goal with the goal of setting up their own style of government. To which Cheney said, 'Psst, that's us.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;California Attorney General Bill Lockyer has suggested that a special toll-free number be set up for women to call in allegations about Arnold Schwarzenegger's past behavior. It's a toll-free number. Who is this for? Women who are upset about the 20-year-old allegations but don't want to spend the 3 cents a minute to actually pay for the call?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Rush Limbaugh announced he's going back to work on Monday, assuming he passes the urine test.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, he went he went to that rehab thing. You know, they said when he comes back, this could be his biggest audience ever. Because besides just the he could now have the crack heads, the deadheads, the cokeheads. Laughter pill heads, you know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was a scary development down there in Washington yesterday, a small plane entered White House air space. Its always a little frightening when that happens. President Bush was rushed to an undisclosed fundraiser.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, during a speech on Iraq, President Bush warned Americans to avoid what he called 'a blanket of fear.' Yeah, President Bush might have lost some credibility, because he actually called it a 'blankie of fear.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Bush met with his foreign policy advisers to talk about how to give power back to the Iraqis by finding a powerful leader the Iraqis know and respect. Not surprisingly, the only name President Bush could come up with was 'Saddam Hussein.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday CNN admitted, this is shocking, admitted that they planted someone in the audience during the question and answer part of last week's Democratic debate. Which explains why someone asked the question, 'Isn't Larry King hot?&quot;&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, what a storm we had. Was that unbelievable? Like the storm of the century in Los Angeles. No, it was. Traffic was so bad -- listen to this -- illegal aliens were actually giving back their driver's licenses.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is going to London on Monday. And he's taking along extra security, you know, in case Prince Charles tries anything funny.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;American officials in Iraq are reportedly very frustrated with the Iraqi government, because instead of making progress, Iraqis are fighting about who's gonna be in charge and who's gonna make the most money. Well, we said we wanted to give them an American-style democracy. Sounds like they got it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know where President Bush was today? Disneyland. He was in Orlando, Florida. He was in Disneyland, and he spoke about his plans for health care for all Americans. I believe he delivered the address in 'Fantasy Land.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rush Limbaugh announced he's going back to work on Monday. Doctors say his rehab was successful, but it could be weeks before he's 100% self-righteous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Democrats are filibustering the Republicans in Congress and now the Republicans say they'll filibuster back. It's going back and forth like a perpetual filibuster. By the way, this is the kind of government we hope to bring to Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Good news, Rush Limbaugh is out of rehab, ladies and gentlemen, after being gone for a month. He sobered up and realized he is a liberal Democrat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rush Limbaugh spent the last few weeks at a rehab program. But now Rush says he's ready to head back to work. He's going back. Yeah, apparently, Rush apparently, Rush first realized he had a problem with drugs when he said something nice about Hillary Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just about a half hour ago, the US Senate finished a marathon session on judicial nominees that lasted 30-straight hours. 30-straight hours. Yeah. In fact, around 5:00 AM, Ted Kennedy was so tired, he put his head down on several desks.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Arnold Schwarzenegger, now launching his own investigation into the sexual harassment allegations against him. He is investigating himself, which-- well, doesn't that sound like an excuse to get another crack at these women, you know? 'You say I touched you. Did I touch you here? Did I touch you there? Was it firm? Did I touch you like this?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And 'Operation Iron Hammer' is going on in Iraq right now. 'Iron Hammer' -- isn't that the name of the Paris Hilton video? I thought that was the Paris Hilton video, 'Iron Hammer.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I got to be honest. After watching all those depressing and menacing Osama bin Laden videos, this Paris Hilton tape is kind of refreshing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The FBI broke into a New York City ice cream store, busted in. And they jumped them and shut them down because they were laundering funds for Al Qaeda. An ice cream store right here in New York. Do you know the one? It's just up on Third Avenue. It's Mohamed and Jerry's.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Democratic candidate Dennis Kucinich, he is one of the eight or nine guys running for President and he says that he looking for a wife. He says he wants to get married so he can run as a married candidate. And when Bill Clinton heard this he said, 'Hey, take mine. Go ahead. Whatever you want.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Bush Administration announced that it is starting its own news channel in Iraq so they can deliver the Administration's point of view without any interference. Not surprisingly, they're going to call it the Fox News Network.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Today's Washington Post says that of the nine Democratic presidential candidates, Wesley Clark has the most presidential hair style. Not only that, the Post says that Al Sharpton has the best hair style for a first lady.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know, you're all excited because we have a new governor, I know. Earlier today, Arnold Schwarzenegger sworn in as the new Governor of California. Yeah. He put one hand in the air, the other hand on the Bible, which is a good start. At least we know where his hands are now.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Immediately after Arnold was sworn in, Gloria Allred jumped up and said, 'Listen, while you have your hand on the Bible, I would like to ask you a few questions.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, I saw Governor Schwarzenegger. He gave a great speech. It was long, ten minutes, he spoke. This is interesting trivia. He said more words in that speech than in all his movies put together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Rush Limbaugh went back to work today. He said the five weeks he spent in rehab were the best weeks of his life, and the Democrats said the five weeks he was off were the best weeks of their lives, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He said -- this is what I love -- he said the rehab process was wonderful. Of course. Sure. When you're rich, you don't have to go through that whole being arrested for drugs process like normal people do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President's trip to England tomorrow -- this has the White House guys going crazy. I saw footage of them. They're learning how to bow before the Queen, practicing saying 'Your Highness,' learning how to act in front of royalty. No, I'm sorry. Those are the Democrats in Iowa, when Hillary Clinton showed up. I'm sorry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, some Democrats are talking seriously about Hillary Clinton running for President in 2004. I tell you, see, I don't think they're serious. Know what they're doing? I think they're trying to get Rush Limbaugh to go back on drugs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Saddam Hussein has put out another new tape to his followers. Have you seen the new tape? It's really weird. In this one, he's having sex with Paris Hilton. I couldn't believe it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Boy, I'm so happy you people are here because we had an audience Friday night, you remember those folks? I hate talking about people when they're not here, but my God! They were, talk about barbarians! Talk about a rough crowd. Halfway through the show, they demanded self rule.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, I want to tell you, things are back to normal at my house. Rush Limbaugh's voice is booming out of mom's trailer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rush is back on the air, you know he was away for a month at drug rehab. And he's happy now to be off the drugs, and he's gone back to being addicted to pie. That's what he's addicted to now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought this showed real progress, the US will help the Iraqi nation write their own constitution, and their constitution will be almost exactly like ours. So that's a pretty good thing, don't you think? Yeah. And they're serious about it, they have even found a guy to sign it named Ahmed Hancock.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big day, anybody here from California? Congratulations, they finally put your state out, so you can go home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today Arnold Schwarzenegger officially became governor of California. So congratulations to Arnold Schwarzenegger. And after the inauguration, Arnold wasted no time, he got right down to groping.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, yesterday, Arnold Schwarzenegger sworn in as Governor of California. My favorite part -- you see this? When he walked up to the governor's mansion and said to Gray Davis - 'Get out!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Arnold told the people of California, 'I will never forget you. Unless, of course, I groped you, then I can't remember anything.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our own President Bush is currently in Britain visiting with Prime Minister Tony Blair. Bush said it was cool driving on the wrong side of the road. He said it reminded him of his college days in Yale.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess the trip is going well. There was one embarrassing moment when the Prime Minister said to President Bush, he said, 'Would you like to see the English Channel?' And Bush said, 'Oh, you gotta get satellite dish. You get 500 channels.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now as you know, Saddam Hussein released yet another tape week. It was played on the Al Jazeera network. Here's my question. You think they have sweeps over there, too, like the big ratings period? You know what I'm sayin'? Do they wait to release the tape? Like, does Al Jazeera tease it on11:00 news? 'Saddam's latest message -- how will it affect breast implants? Film at 11:00.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a number of JFK specials on this weekend, 'cause it's the 40th anniversary of his assassination. And this is interesting. According to medical records, JFK was taking painkillers, tranquilizers, amphetamines, sleeping pills, antibiotics, steroids and testosterone all at the same time. In fact, he is the only Democrat Rush Limbaugh really admired.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After five weeks of drug rehab, Rush went back to doing his radio show. He told his audience just because he was doing something that was contradictory to what he was telling other people to do, that doesn't mean he's a hypocrite. I thought that was the definition of a hypocrite. I don't know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, he told his radio audience he never lied to the public. He lied to himself. And today, Bill Clinton went, 'Boy, this guy's good.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Democratic front runner Howard Dean, Howard Dean being called a hero this week. It seems he was going to a campaign rally in Iowa. One of his campaign volunteers collapsed from a seizure. And since Dean is a doctor, he ran over and treated the guy until the ambulance came. It was pretty good, yeah. He's not the only candidate that helped, since the trial lawyer, John Edwards chased the ambulance all the way to the hospital.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new movie 'Master and Commander,' have you seen this movie? It's pretty good. Yeah, it's a great movie. Takes place in 1805, when a British ship battles a French ship that's bigger, faster, better armed, but the French still lose. So not much has changed in 200 years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today was the second day Rush Limbaugh was back on the air. How many of you have heard Rush Limbaugh since he has been back from drug rehabilitation? How many of you miss the mellower, drug-addled Rush?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My mom has been so inspired by Rush, she is giving up booze.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rush Limbaugh spent five weeks in a drug rehabilitation clinic. And he says he is a new man, a brand new man. And as a matter of fact, he said he is head over heels in love with Liza Minelli.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're furious over in England over President Bush's visit. He visited the country and they're all getting upset. And in fact -- this is the latest -- in a speech, the Mayor of London described President Bush as -- and this is a quote - 'The greatest threat to life on this planet.' ... Yeah, after hearing this, President Bush said, 'That's ridiculous, what about Godzilla?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The other day in LA, Madonna held a fundraising party for former General Wesley Clark. That's right. And actually, when you think about it, Madonna and General Clark have a lot in common. They both had thousands of soldiers under them.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is in Great Britain, as we speak. You know, I don't think he has a real good grasp of geography. Like yesterday, as he got off the plane in London, he asked one of his aides, 'Did this state vote for me or Al Gore in 2000?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is also the first US President to spend the night at Buckingham Palace at the request of the royal family. First one ever. As he was showing the President around, Prince Charles asked President Bush to go on to see Big Ben. And Bush said, 'Oh, I'm from Texas.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At midnight, almost all the electricity in Baghdad went out. The whole city blacked out. No electricity. So it sounds like Gray Davis has started his new job, yeah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a Justice Department report, an FBI official took a prostitute -- a prostitute with him on an out of town training trip.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Jesse Jackson attacked Rush Limbaugh today regarding Rush's drug addiction, and you know, Rush, who was always against drugs, and he's turned out to be addicted, and Jesse attacked him for that. Jackson said that Rush Limbaugh can't have it both ways. You know, it's not like being a minister while nailing your secretary. It's a totally different thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll tell you -- you know who really likes Thanksgiving? Our new Governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger. This is the one day he can fondle the breasts without getting in trouble.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what Rush Limbaugh had for Thanksgiving? Cold turkey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Hillary Clinton is spending Thanksgiving in Afghanistan and Iraq. She says she wants to see for herself just what President Bush has been telling her. That makes sense. I think she's used to presidents lying to her.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier this week, President Clinton released a list of his 21 favorite books. And today, a disbelieving President Bush said, 'Yeah, right. Nobody's read 21 books. I don't think so. I don't think so.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, President Bush, not a big reader. In fact, this is the actual book they put together to explain the war to the President. Do you have that? This is the book they use. It's called 'The Cat In Iraq.' It's about a cat that causes a big mess.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's a strange story. Did you hear about this in Iraq? The terrorists are now firing missiles from donkey carts, which is -- donkey-cart terrorists. Sounds like some Iraqi Playstation 2 game.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's an interesting story. The New York Times reporting that, back in the '60s, Howard Dean -- you know, he's the leading contender for president for the Democrats. Listen to this. He used a letter from a doctor about a back condition to keep himself out of the draft, from going to Vietnam, and then spent the next ten months skiing. Well, he's done the impossible. He's made Clinton and Bush look like war heroes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Wesley Clark -- you like this guy? Yeah, he's a good guy. Well, he revealed this week his father was Jewish, but he's now a Catholic, but he attends Presbyterian Church. My guess -- he's celebrating Kwanzaa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know about Neil Bush, President Bush's brother? You know about this divorce? He's going through this horrible divorce. And in his deposition, he testified -- these were his words -- that, during business trips to Asia, he testified he was unfaithful to his wife. And he said, during business trips to Asia, women would knock on his hotel room door. They would come in. He would have sex with them. But he didn't know if they were prostitutes, because they never asked for money. And he didn't pay them. They would just come in the room, and he would have sex with them and then leave. And today, Clinton said, 'What was the name of that hotel?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to today's LA Times, Michael Jackson owes over $200 million to creditors. $200 million -- who is his accountant, Gray Davis? What is that? $200 million?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had, of course, we had the annual big Letterman family Thanksgiving dinner, and sadly, my uncle Earl could not attend. Did not make it. He was detained at an airport in Yemen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You hear about this? President Bush flew over to Baghdad, had dinner with the troops. How about that? Yeah, it was it was $1,000 a plate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Bush surprised the troops in Baghdad. I understand that [Bush will do] anything to get out of having dinner with Cheney at the ranch.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many of you folks saw the parade earlier? What do you think?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And there's a new balloon this year, 'Little Bill.' How many of you saw Little Bill? Do you remember Little Bill? He is the one that one that got 'Big Bill' impeached.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This year's parade featured a giant Uncle Sam balloon -- a giant Uncle Sam balloon for the first time in 60 years. Isn't that amazing? First time in 60 years. Yeah. Yeah, unfortunately -- unfortunately, halfway through the parade, the Uncle Sam balloon accused the Pikachu balloon of being an evildoer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush continued a White House tradition, and he pardoned the Thanksgiving turkey. Pardoned it. Yeah, that's a nice thing to do. Yeah, immediately afterwards, Michael Jackson hired the turkey's lawyer.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to the Tonight Show. Nice to have you here. It is now 11:36. Do you know where the President is? No, nobody does.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's a pretty amazing story. I guess you all know that, by now, on Thanksgiving Day, President Bush shocked 600 US troops stationed in Iraq when he showed up to have dinner with them. And, at first, some of the troops were so stunned, they didn't believe it was really the President. And then Bush went ahead and mispronounced some words and they went, 'Oh, my gosh.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's pretty amazing. He flew all the way to Baghdad, had dinner, and then flew home. Don't you wish your relatives were like that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The background story is fascinating to a thing like this, because the President's staff told him nobody would suspect that he would go to Iraq, and Bush said, 'Well, sure, since it's Thanksgiving, everybody would think I went to Turkey, yeah.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He gave quite a stirring speech to the troops while in Baghdad. He said, 'We will stay until the job is done,' and then he hopped on a plane and went back to Texas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President took a pretty big risk with this thing. Not just because of continuing attacks, but those people -- they still have those weapons of mass destruction over there somewhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They said this was the biggest Thanksgiving surprise involving a US President since Hillary jumped out of the turkey and caught Bill with the Hilton sisters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And toy industry analysts say that the talking Bill Clinton doll is outselling the talking President Bush doll two to one. Well, sure, that's because people would rather hear the Bill Clinton lie about Barbie than the President Bush doll lie about GI Joe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, the Clinton doll is a better value, because it's a talking Clinton doll. You get two answers to every question.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As I'm sure you know by now, President Bush snuck out and flew over to Baghdad Thanksgiving Day on this secret mission. He met with our troops for 2 1/2 hours and then flew home. In fact, this is fascinating. The only people who knew were his wife, of course, who had to keep up the cover story, the Secret Service, who had to protect him, and of course, former President Bill Clinton, who had to teach him how to the sneak out of the White House for a night without getting caught.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell ya, I think President Bush is pushing his luck a little bit with this. Like, today, he flew to North Korea for lunch. I don't think that was a good idea.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;White House advisers now urging President Bush to roll back the tariffs on steel imports. But Bush said before he would agree to do anything, they had to answer some tough questions. You know, like, 'What's a tariff?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our good friend, Saudi Arabia, Saudi Arabia announced today they're going to hold back on giving the money they pledged to Iraq for rebuilding until Iraq can become a more secure place.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the latest terrorist tactic now is this thing, the suicide donkeys. Have you heard of these? They use suicide donkeys packed with explosives. Are they really suicide donkeys? Are the donkeys going, 'Let me try that vest on.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush hosted the NASCAR drivers at the White House yesterday. Bush is a big NASCAR fan, did you know that? Well, NASCAR is a lot like Iraq, really. I mean, you go really fast around and around, then you end up in the same place, basically.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, President Bush signed what's being billed as the healthy forest restoration act. This is part of what he calls his clear skies legislation. You know why they call it that? Because once you cut down all the trees, you have a clear view of the sky.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oil prices are now at their highest level in 20 years. And today, Exxon declared the war in Iraq a complete success.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Democratic frontrunner Howard Dean admitted to Chris Matthews on the Hardball show that he got out of the draft because of a bad back. He has a curvature of the spine. Apparently, it's curved too far to the left.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big toy retailer, FAS Schwarz, is going bankrupt. Bankrupt! How does a toy store go broke in December? It's like a brothel going out of business during the Democratic convention.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of Democrats, Dennis Kucinich, you know who he is? He's the bachelor, the single guy running for president. Nobody knows who he is.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's actually looking for a wife out on the campaign trail. He's single, and he's advertising on his Website he'd like to meet a First Lady. He's said he's looking for 'a dynamic, outspoken woman who knows about healthcare.' And today Bill Clinton said, 'Hey, be careful what you wish for. Be careful what you wish for, buddy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Washington, President Bush has signed a bill to invest $3.7 billion billion -- $3.7 billion into nanotechnology.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush also signed a law this week that will allow the timber industry to cut down excess trees. See, if you're in the timber industry, excess trees are the ones that haven't been cut down yet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush said this week he also wants to send men to the moon. And then he was told, 'We already did that back in '69.' And he said, 'I was drinking then. I don't remember the '60s.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Rush Limbaugh announced that the authorities in Florida have seized his medical records. He's like a kingpin now. They seized his medical records. And Rush Limbaugh's lawyer said that his medical records will show that he had a legitimate reason for taking pain medication. Now if he can just come up for a legitimate reason for buying 10,000 pills in the parking lot behind Denny's, I think, I think he may be onto something, yeah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to USA Today, researchers now believe as many as 5% of adults suffer from attention deficit disorder. Actually, a lot of famous people have attention deficit disorder. President Bush has it. No, he does. You ever notice? He has trouble focusing attention on the deficit. Have you noticed that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's a creepy, horrible story. You hear about this guy in Germany known as 'The Cannibal Killer?' You hear about this guy? This guy pled guilty. ... He advertised online for someone who wanted to be murdered and eaten. And he got 400 responses. No, no, this is true. It's not like I'm not making it up. He said, 'Anybody that wants to be murdered and eaten, contact me.' 400 people. And he picked this guy and killed him and ate him. On the other hand, Dennis Kucinich, who's running for president, is advertising for a wife. He hasn't met anybody yet.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to ABC News, they say Saddam may have withdrawn $1 billion from Iraq's central bank the day before we invaded. $1 billion -- you know, my ATM stops at $300, OK?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Police in Iran have shut down four McDonald's-style fast-food restaurants where young people have been meeting members of opposite sex.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld met with the two biggest warlords in Afghanistan. I guess they wanted his autograph. Yeah, pretty much. 'Hey, you da man.&quot;No, you da man.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said today he would like America to establish a permanent base on the moon. This is all part of his plan to get Americans used to an environment where the air is unbreathable, and there are no trees.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You probably know -- Southern California voted number one in both the college football polls. Voted number one, but they were totally left out by the people at the BCS national committee. You know this? ... This seems terribly unfair, because this is the number one team. But the computer makes the decision. And because the computer didn't pick them as one of the two teams, they won't get to play in the national championship game. Even Florida voters are going, 'What the hell is this all about?'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me tell you, people, people are outraged about this. I mean, that Florida thing, that was about the presidency. This is college football.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an interview in Rolling Stone, Senator John Kerry, who's running for president, said that when he voted for the war in Iraq, he didn't expect President Bush to 'F' it up as badly as he did. He used the 'F' word. But you know, just to talk so freely, well, I kind of had a hunch this was coming. Remember when he was on our show? Show Kerry when he was on our show three weeks ago.&quot; Leno (from tape): &quot;You were selling a bike -- do you know the thing I'm talking about?&quot; Kerry (from tape): &quot;Oh, [bleep], I do. First of all, [bleep] you. It's great to be here.&quot; Leno (from tape): &quot;Oh, sure, thanks for coming.&quot; Kerry (from tape): &quot;It's good to be with a [bleep] [bleep] from Massachusetts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tomorrow, former Vice President Al Gore expected to endorse Howard Dean as the Democratic nominee for President of the United States. You thought John Kerry was using four-letter words before. Oh, man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, to John Kerry, 'Dean' is a four-letter word, if I'm not mistaken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The ratings are in for last week. 13 million people watched Paris Hilton in her new TV show, 'The Simple Life,' which sounds like a lot until you realize 70 million saw her porn video. ... Have you seen the program? It takes place on an Arkansas farm. The local residents really weren't that shocked about the videotape. After 30 years of Clinton, it's hard to shock the people of Arkansas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, they had the big blizzard in Washington DC, it was really bad. It was so bad, President Bush had to cancel six fundraisers.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Not getting to play. And you wonder who's in charge of this -- this BCS rating thing. We have footage of the guy who tabulates the ballots. I remember this guy. Do we have him? Look, remember him?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They won the polls, but they don't get to go to the big game. And today, Al Gore said, 'Hey, welcome to my world.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The forecast back East -- bitter. Bitter, bitter cold. And that's just between Joe Lieberman and Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Al Gore skipped over his buddy, Joe Lieberman, and decided to endorse Howard Dean for the presidency.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, General Wesley Clark commented on Gore endorsing Howard Dean. He said -- he said, 'Endorsements don't win elections.' Hey, in this country, [votes] don't even win elections anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, there's a huge controversy with presidential candidate Senator John Kerry. Seems he used the 'F' word when describing President Bush's efforts in Iraq. He said Bush 'F'd' up. In fact, when Bush heard he said the 'F' word, he said, 'fundraiser?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For most Democrats, the worst 'F' word of all? Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last week, Congressman Nick Smith said that he was offered a bribe -- he was offered a bribe to vote for this Medicare bill. But now he says he doesn't want the ethics committee to investigate it. So you know what that means. I guess the check cleared.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love this. Vice President Dick Cheney spent yesterday hunting in West Pennsylvania - Western Pennsylvania at the Rolling Rock Club. He shot more than 70 pheasants and an unknown number of ducks. He shot 70 pheasants. At least he only kills what he can eat. I think that's the important thing, really.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How do you shoot 70? What you are using, a machine gun?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was an earthquake today in Richmond, Virginia, a 4.5 earthquake was felt as far away as Washington, DC. Unbelievable. 4.5, that's big. In fact, at the White House, people haven't jumped under their desks like that since Clinton was in office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The godfather of American funk George Clinton -- you hear about this? George Clinton arrested. ... Arrested for drug possession. How 'bout that? Finally, a Clinton Rush Limbaugh can relate to. There you go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you don't know George, he's the other black guy named Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On this date, 1952, pregnancy was first acknowledged on television on an episode of 'I Love Lucy.' Prior to that, pregnancy had never even been mentioned. The word had never been used on TV before. In fact, up until the '70s, married couples on TV didn't even sleep in the same bed. Or as the Clintons call that, 'Reality TV,' yeah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I saw one of those perfect Yuletide scenes at Wal-Mart today. Their Santa Claus in Wal-Mart was dragged off in an immigration raid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Gore has endorsed Howard Dean for president. Huh? That's right. That's pretty fitting. The guy who didn't beat Bush endorses the guy who won't beat Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And when Joe Lieberman found out about Al Gore endorsing Howard Dean, he said, 'Oh, thank you, Jesus.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Early today, President Bush met with the Premier of China. This is big. Isn't this nice? Yeah, apparently, the Chinese Premier asked Bush to loosen trade restrictions and Bush asked the Premier if he was Jackie Chan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, Al Gore endorsed presidential candidate Howard Dean instead of endorsing his former running mate, Joe Lieberman. Amazing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, when asked why, Gore said, 'I could never endorse Lieberman, he supported Al Gore.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Bush signed a new bill that will overhaul Medicare. Yeah. ... Afterward, the President called the bill the greatest victory for America's seniors since 'JAG' moved to Friday night.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In political news, Howard Dean was endorsed by Al Gore. Now, if Dean can get Gray Davis to campaign for him, too, that will put him over the top. Yeah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gore and Dean announced it together in Harlem. You know, it's just a couple homeboys hanging, you know.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Howard Dean and Al Gore in Harlem. Doesn't that sound like the plot to one of those Farrelly Brother movies? 'White &amp; Whiter,' ladies and gentlemen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After they made the announcement, they flew from Harlem to Iowa. This surprised me. Are there a lot of direct flights from Harlem to Iowa?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know, it's interesting to watch all the pundits speculate about this. Like, Tim Russert said -- he said Gore's endorsement of Dean may be just the way to set himself against Hillary Clinton for the nomination in 2008. What a dilemma that would be for Bill. I mean, a man who was under him for eight years versus a woman who hasn't been under him in 20 years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, this endorsement means Howard Dean is no longer the angriest candidate. Joe Lieberman is now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, Lieberman, Gore's friend and running mate in the last campaign, he said he got blindsided by Gore. But see, he should have seen it coming. You see the button Gore had on yesterday? Show -- show the tape. See the -- can we go in close? What does that button say? See, 'Lose friends now, ask me how.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, of course, none of the other Democratic candidates -- they were stunned. They didn't see this coming, either. Now here's my question. If these guys want to be Commander-in-Chief, shouldn't they see this kind of thing coming? I mean, forget predicting what Osama bin Laden is going to do. They can't even predict what Al Gore's going to do. See?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Vice President Dick Cheney went out hunting for pheasants this past weekend, shot 70 pheasants. Seems like an -- 70, yeah. Seems like an awful lot. You know, Cheney really has the heart of a hunter. And before that, I think he had the heart of an accountant and then he had the -- then the heart of a mailman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And remember when Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said he was going to investigate himself over these charges of sexual harassment? Remember, he was gonna -- we was gonna investigate it himself. Well, he's now decided not to do that. He said he sat down. 'The left hand talked to the right hand. It was decided that there -- there was nothing there much to talk about really.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night they had one of those Democratic candidate presidential, want-to-be-debate kind of things. How many of you saw the big debate? You look at these guys, I can't believe Bush has to raise $200 million to beat those clowns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier in the week, Howard Dean was endorsed by former Vice President Al Gore, and now Howard Dean is getting campaign advice from Al Gore.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, Colin Powell named James Brown, the hardest working man in show business, James Brown, named James Brown the Secretary of Soul, and Foreign Minister of Funk. And I think this is great because before, before the Bush Administration, you probably remember this, Soul and Funk were two different agencies.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday at the White House, President Bush hosted the Premier of China, Wen Jibao. The Premier of China, or as President Bush calls him, 'Benny.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What an unusual thing, but it does happen, down there in Washington DC, they had an earthquake. An earthquake, very unusual thing, but it happened, my God they had an earthquake, things went crazy for a while. For example, over at the Clinton townhouse...now wait a minute. Hillary, because of the earthquake, Hillary was accidentally thrown into bed with Bill.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During last night's debate, Howard Dean was the only candidate -- the only candidate to raise his hand when Ted Koppel asked, 'How many candidates think Howard Dean can beat President Bush?' Yeah. Meanwhile, all eight candidates raised their hands when Ted Koppel asked, 'Who thinks I have the worst comb over ever?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Iraqi governing council now includes a woman dentist, which is very controversial. Because the Iraqis, they don't know how to relate to her, 'cause she's a woman. And the British, they don't know how to relate to her, 'cause she's a dentist.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I got my Christmas card today from Senator John Kerry. I think he's losing. Anybody get one of these? See, 'Have a Merry F***ing Christmas.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you probably know, Senator John Kerry caused quite a controversy this week. He was in an in interview in Rolling Stone, the current issue. He used the 'F' word in describing President Bush's policy towards Iraq. He said Bush 'F'd it up.' See, that's the difference with these new Democrats. Kerry talked about it, but Clinton, he went out and actually did it. You know what I'm saying?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, our new Governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, lit the state Christmas tree, and then he sang his famous -- favorite Christmas song - 'Do you feel what I feel?' Yeah. 'Do you feel what I feel?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you. That was just great. That was very nice. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. That makes up for not being endorsed by Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;James Brown, the hardest working man in show business, James Brown has been named by Colin Powell as the Secretary of Soul and the Foreign Minister of Funk. Congratulations. His mandate will be to stem the alarming decline of funk. Try to reverse that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Governor of California, earlier today, I thought this was great, said it will not be necessary, this is what Governor Schwarzenegger said, it will not be necessary to investigate sexual harassment charges against him. Arnold Schwarzenegger says it will not be necessary to investigate the sexual harassment charges against him. Bill Clinton heard that and he said, 'You can do that?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week in Washington, President Bush attended a concert given by a newly reformed Iraqi symphony orchestra. Yeah, very nice. Yeah, it was a lovely evening of classical music, until President Bush asked them to play the theme from 'Bonanza.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, the Pentagon announced that only -- only the countries that supported the United States in the war in Iraq can participate in rebuilding Iraq. That's what they said. Yeah, among the eligible countries -- England, Spain and Halliburtonstan.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Boy, I got screwed, I paid way too much for my Christmas presents this year. I was really overcharged. I bought them all on the Halliburton store. $61 million.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Pentagon says that Dick Cheney's old company Halliburton has been overcharging the government in its 'no bid' contract in Iraq. Boy, how bad are you overcharging when the Pentagon notices?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new study, 14 days of complete rest can be enough to drop your IQ by 20 points. Which is really scary when you consider President Bush took almost the entire summer off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone down in Washington is getting into the holiday spirit. You know, former President Clinton finished his decorating. He put mistletoe under his desk.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush will be seeing a performance of 'The Nutcracker.' This is the first time 'The Nutcracker' has been in the White House since...well...I guess since Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's being said by the White House that this year President Bush will be sending out 1.5 million Christmas cards - one million of which will start with 'Dear Santa.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to the Tonight Show, everybody. And of course, happy Groundhog Day, everybody. America's most wanted Groundhog, Saddam Hussein, captured in Iraq over the weekend.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Great job, United States Army. He was captured in a hole under a farmhouse. Apparently, he was doing the Iraqi version of 'The Simple Life.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, it's ironic that they found him in a hole, since the term 'A- hole' has been used to describe him so many times.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, when they found him, Dick Cheney wanted to know -- how deep was the hole, and was there any oil in it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, it seems old Saddam was turned in by some family members. Boy, you thought you didn't get along with your relatives during the holidays.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The rumor is, he was brutalized during the arrest -- well, that's according to his brother, Jermaine Hussein.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, you all saw that tape of him being examined by the doctor. They took a DNA sample from him, which has got to be humiliating. One day you're president of the entire country, the next day, being forced to give a DNA sample. Clinton said, 'Tell me about it!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the time of his capture, he had $750,000 in cash on him. They think he may have been trying to buy three gallons of gas from Halliburton. Yeah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Isn't that unbelievable? $750,000 in cash? You know what that means? He's now eligible for the Bush tax cut.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, reaction coming in from all over the world. The British government praising the United States today. The Spanish government said it was a great day. The French government praised Saddam for the way he surrendered. 'We couldn't have done it so quickly ourselves.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you, it shows what a coward this Saddam guy really is. Remember, he always said he would never be taken alive? Even though he had three guns on him, he didn't struggle. He didn't try to run. He put up no resistance at all. Even Glen Campbell put up a better fight when he got arrested.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, when he was captured, he was surrounded by the only nine remaining people who didn't want him caught - the Democratic presidential candidates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's an amazing story, and what a downfall that is. He went from living in a palace to living in a two-room mud hut with just a few pieces of clothing or, as guys in Beverly Hills call it, divorce, basically.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, now there will be all kinds of charges brought against him. Hopefully, the Santa Barbara DA will not be handling the case.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You go through that whole sequence of public events -- you know, you have the indictment, then you have the trial, then the sentencing, then the appeals, then, of course, the tearful interview with Barbara Walters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Listen to this -- more good news for the government. Earlier today, they found Martha Stewart hiding in a hole in Connecticut.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, congratulations to Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson. They have the number one movie in the country, 'Something's Gotta Give.' Terrific film, terrific film. It's interesting, I guess you do a lot of ad-libbing in this movie. In one scene, Jack pats Diane Keaton on the rear end. Critics say this ad-lib was so refreshing and honest, it may give him another nomination. Is that fair? Jack does it, it's good. Arnold does it, he gets sued.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sunday morning, I get up early and I'm stringing lights out on the house. And about 11:00, my mom comes running out of house, screaming, 'They caught the bastard, they caught the bastard!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know by now that Saddam Hussein was captured and he was living in this like hole, this like six by eight foot hole in the ground, and it had a shaft for ventilation. Here in New York City we call it the subway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And he was dirty, he had not bathed, he had a full kind of scraggly, frightening beard, he had a bag full of cash, he was carrying a pistol, he had several unopened packages of underwear. I want to...it's like I have a twin!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So now he, you've seen the pictures, he had the long beard, they say he was confused, disoriented. It's the same conditional Al Gore was in before he endorsed Howard Dean.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you think about it, it's a strange world. One day you're the leader of Iraq, the next day you're being checked for fleas on Fox News.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was very surprising, because Saddam Hussein just gave himself up. Just gave himself up. I mean, hell, Michael Jackson put up more of a fight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I'm telling you, this guy, he was a wreck. I mean you saw the pictures, just, and they had to clean him up in a hurry, so what they did was they gave him an emergency queer makeover. That seemed to do the trick.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey here's some great news - today France offered to help join the hunt for Saddam Hussein! They've come onboard!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell, first the economy gets better, now Saddam Hussein has been captured. For the Democrats, this is like the Grinch that stole Christmas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess by now, you all saw that hole in the ground that Saddam was hiding in. Here's my question - why did we take him out of it. Why not just fill it in?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to CNN, before the soldiers pulled him out of the hole, Saddam yelled, 'I'm wiling to negotiate!' I'm no expert on the art of the deal or anything, but when you're in a hole with 600 soldiers pointing rifles at you, what exactly is your bargaining chip? 'If don't let me go, I'll kill this rat!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Give you an idea how bad Saddam's living conditions were. ... Fox News employees couldn't find one thing to steal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When they found Saddam, he had $750,000 in cash, a pistol and two AK-47's. They now believe he was trying to start a new career as a rap star.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During his interrogation, Hussein was asked about weapons of mass destruction, he said, 'The US dreamed them up as a reason to go to war with us.' This made Howard Dean furious, he said, 'Hey that's my line.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All the pinheads are coming out of the woodwork -- Democratic Congressman Jim McDermott from Washington is questioning the timing of the capture of Saddam Hussein. Yeah...that his capture would come....while we were looking for him!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Saddam is currently being held in an undisclosed location. So apparently, he's with Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's a quick note from the estate of the late Senator Strom Thurmond - Happy Kwanzaa!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love this story - a 78 year African American woman has come forward claiming that she is Strom Thurmond's daughter. She was the product of an affair young Strom had with the family maid. The maid kept quiet for years so as not to hurt the famed Republican's career. And today, Rush Limbaugh said, 'Where can I get a maid like that?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A male nurse in New Jersey by the name of Charles Cullen has admitted to killing 30 to 40 patients in hospitals that he claims were mercy killings. Or as HMO's call this guy - 'Employee of The Month.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've had an interesting time at home lately. Mom keeps watching Saddam's flea exam over and over again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Saddam was found near a hut. Not just a hole, but a hole that was adjacent to a hut. You're doing good if you can find that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the hut they found unopened underwear, guns, a can of 7-Up and the Paris Hilton video.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My favorite is the 'Guns and Underwear.' Have you got their new CD, Paul? Guns and Underwear. They're going to be on the show in a few weeks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They also found pairs of Saddam's boxer shorts - by the way that's the closest we've come to finding weapons of mass destruction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Saddam just came out with his hands up. Hell, Winona Ryder put up more of fight than that!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's expected that charges will be filed against Michael Jackson by the end of the week. Right now Michael is in Tikrit looking for a hole.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone is still buzzing about the capture of Saddam Hussein. That's still the big story. He was found in a six foot by eight foot hole that was covered with garbage, mice and spiders. A New York apartment like that could go for $6,000.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During Saddam's questioning he was said to be smug, curt and sarcastic. When he was asked to apologize he said he was just doing his impression of Donald Rumsfeld.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The day after Saddam's capture Howard Dean was supposed to give a major speech. At the last minute the speech had to be dramatically altered. The new title of the speech was 'Oh Crap!'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At his press conference this week, President Bush said he does not want to use the capture of Saddam Hussein for political gain. Oh, no. No. He says he wants to see a very public, very slow trial that would last until, like, next November.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry, Dick Gephardt and Joe Lieberman all agree the capture of Saddam Hussein was a wonderful thing. But they said now we have to keep our eyes focused on the real enemy: Howard Dean.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush got an MRI on his sore knees. They forced him to cut back on his running. This is nice, though. While he was at the hospital, he stopped in to see Dick Cheney, who was having his daily heart attack.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;James Carville is on the show tonight. For those of you that speak English, you might want to watch this segment on the closed captioned TV.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You thought Howard Dean was angry.&quot; Carville &quot;makes Howard Dean look like the Dalai Lama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're learning more and more about former Senator Sperm Thurmond. I'm sorry, Strom Thurmond.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems Strom was a pretty tough guy to work for. He made sure people did their job. In fact, he really stayed on top of the maid, from what I understand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it turns out Strom's daughter is a school teacher from Los Angeles. And to her credit -- to her credit, she waited 78 years before making the sexual allegations public, to which Arnold Schwarzenegger said [imitating Schwarzenegger] 'Why couldn't I meet women who'd wait that long?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to the Late Show. My name is Dave, and I want to negotiate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody is still excited about the Saddam Hussein arrest. ... We thought he was a punk and a thug and a tough guy. Then he just turned himself in. They pulled him out of his hole and that was it. Phil Specter put up more of a fight than that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're learning more and more about the capture of Saddam Hussein. For example, it seems that US forces acted on a tip from Rush Limbaugh's maid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For the last four days they've been interrogating Saddam Hussein. ... During that four-day period, he denies knowing Osama bin Laden. He says, oh, yeah, I'd run into him at industry functions, but I didn't really know him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is an avid runner. He jogs two or three miles a day. ... His doctors are giving him an MRI exam. I've been thinking about this. I don't know anybody who's had this much wear and tear on their knees - well...&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, the ratings are in. The ratings are in. And the other night, Paris Hilton's TV show got a got a bigger rating than President Bush's interview with Diane Sawyer. Isn't that amazing? People would rather see 'The Simple Life' than the 'Simple President.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, Bush was in the hospital yesterday for an MRI on his knee. And that can be a painful procedure. In fact, they had a pretzel standing by, in case he needed to be knocked out.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, they say the pain in his knees was caused by the constant pressure of carrying huge sums of money out of fundraisers. See, the pressure on the knees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although, I don't think President Bush really understood the operation. Like when they told him he was getting an MRI, he said, 'You know, I'm really happy with AT&amp;T.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I thought this was nice. While he was at the hospital, he stopped off to see Senator John Kerry, whose presidential campaign, as you know, is on life support.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, want to wish our best to Secretary of State Colin Powell. I understand his prostate surgery very successful. Wish him the best. Although, I understand now they're gonna have to change his name to Semi-Colin Powell.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You want to drive Howard Dean nuts? I mean, he looks mad all the time, doesn't he, Howard Dean? He's always fired up. Sneak up behind him and whisper, 'They just captured Osama bin Laden, too.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, Howard Dean took a swipe at former President Clinton today, yeah, which is kind of interesting. See, they say the problem with Dean is he shoots from the hip, you know? Clinton did that, too, but in a, you know, totally, totally different way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is pretty amazing. Moammar Gadhafi announced he is renouncing terrorism and giving up his weapons of mass destruction. This is true. Gee, I wonder why he did that? Maybe seeing his buddy, Saddam, living in that hole had something to do with it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, that's good news. And let's see what's going on with Saddam, or as Jessica Simpson calls him, 'Chicken of the Desert.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When Saddam was captured did you know this? You know what he had on him besides the $750,000? You know what he had on him? He has three packs of brand-new underwear in his possession. See, that shows you how powerful a mother's words can be.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, even though Saddam is 66, he still remembers his mother's advice, 'Always have clean underwear, in case the army of the Great Satan pulls you out of the rat hole you're hiding in and puts you on CNN.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what I love about this Saddam guy? The guy hates the United States. He curses our leaders. He denounces our way of life. When it comes to keeping money around, boy, he loves those US dollars, doesn't he?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Saddam now is being interrogated by our, I guess, the CIA or somebody. But he's claiming he doesn't know anything about anything. So either he's lying, or his vice president ran the country, too. But we don't know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this week, a judge ruled that failed presidential assassin John Hinckley Jr. can be let out on family visits unsupervised. This makes no sense to me. You know what we should do to protect ourselves? The guy's wacky already. Let's give him his own reality show. This way, there will be cameras on him all the time, and we kill two birds with one stone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to mention today is the first day of Hanukkah, ladies and gentlemen, the first day of Hanukkah. That's right. As you know about Hanukkah, it commemorates the miracle of the oil and the miracle is that they weren't overcharged by Halliburton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Are you still excited about Saddam Hussein? Wasn't that thrilling? Now, here is what I like about this the capture of Saddam Hussein. It was the poetic beauty of the whole scenario. Because for years and years we have been told what a vile, evil rat bastard this guy is. For years and years, for decades he is a evil rat bastard and then, you know, we pull him out of a hole. It's perfect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I tell you who is a little worried about this, the Democrats, because they were making all kinds of noise about, 'Yeah, what about this?' And suddenly we find Saddam. Now they have been upstaged, they are struggling for attention. Earlier today, presidential hopeful Dennis Kucinich asked to be checked for fleas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you have any idea of what today is? Do you know what happened five years ago today? Any idea? President Clinton was impeached. I think all of us remember where we were when we heard about this. Yeah, Clinton remembers, because he was at his desk having sex.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So now in honor of 5th anniversary of Clinton's impeachment, I'm going to tell a Clinton classic joke. First, I told this joke in 1998. This is a Clinton classic joke. It goes something like this. Prosecutor Kenneth Starr says he has 75 photos of President Clinton with Monica Lewinsky. 75 photos and most of them are head shots.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many of you felt the earthquake today? Wasn't that scary? 6.5. Or as we say in California, 'Who needs terrorists?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of that, as you know, today the government raised the national terror threat to orange, or high risk. Authorities are asking people to report anything out of the norm, anything unusual, like John Hinckley Jr. walking around unsupervised.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, President Bush also announced today -- listen to this, some good news. He said if we can just capture 17 more guys in holes in Iraq, we can open a golf course, so that's good news.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's another mystery finally cleared up. I guess we all know why Strom Thurmond always called in sick on take your daughter to work day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, now it's a high alert Christmas. Are you aware of that fact? They bumped it up a notch, it a high alert Christmas. Last night mom and I duct taped our tree.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My family is arriving tomorrow, which means one thing: I'll be spending the day in my spider hole.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're learning more and more about Saddam Hussein, in his cell, have you heard about what he has in his cell now? In the cell of Saddam Hussein, here's what we have. We have an army cot, he sleeps on an army cot, there's a pitcher of water and a photo of George Bush. Coincidently, that's also my mom's guest room at my house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought this was interesting. You know, we saw the footage of him being pulled out of the hole, and then we saw him having his has mouth inspected, and they were checking him for fleas and ticks and stuff. And apparently now, what happened as he was being apprehended and taken into custody, he spit at one of the American soldiers, and the guy decked him. And I was thinking this is quite a coincidence, because the same thing happened with Martha Stewart.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I always think about my dad this time of year and what he'd be gettin' me for Christmas if he was still alive, you know? Like, if I was 9 years old right now, and my dad was still here, you know what he'd be doin'? He'd be in the backyard. He'd dig a hole. On Christmas morning, he'd go, 'Hey, Jay! Look, I got you Saddam Hussein's secret hideout. Come on out here. Look at that, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many guys still have shopping to do? How many guys are gonna get out of it by saying, 'We're at Code Orange?'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government has raised the terrorist threat to orange, which stands for high risk of a terrorist attack. You know, the government always gives you a color first, and then they tell you what the color stands for. So why do we need the stupid color? Just say it's high risk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Oh, we're teal! We're teal!&quot;What does that mean?&quot;Look it up.&quot;What's teal?&quot;I don't know.' Just say high risk, low risk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge said he has contacted his counterpart in Mexico about increasing border security. And apparently, Mexico taking this very seriously. Listen to this. They now promise to search every 1 millionth person sneaking across the border.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's some good news. Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has decided to end his weapons of mass destruction program. He's gonna allow inspectors into the country, which, of course, is good news for Bush. In one week, he's disarmed Saddam, Moammar and Howard Dean.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Department of Homeland Security also asking all security officers and airline passengers, as well as airline personnel, to be on the lookout for anything dangerous at the airport, like a drunken Virgin Airlines pilot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I never remember this happening when I was a kid, drunk pilots. Now it's happening all over again. Friday night, a 55-year-old pilot for Virgin Airlines showed up drunk to fly a planeload of passengers from Washington to London. And to make it worse -- listen to this. He was not only drunk. Turns out he's not even a virgin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The judge ordered the pilot to turn over his passport. And now his lawyer's arguing that his client has a heart condition and needs his passport to get home to London to see his cardiologist. Well, that's reassuring. He's not only drunk, he's got a bad heart, too, and he's flying 400 people to London. You know, we don't need terrorists anymore. We have -- we have our own people doin' it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Miami, they arrested a man after he tried to board a plane with razor blades and hacksaw blades hidden in his shoes. Police said they got suspicious when they saw him walking through the airport.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, yesterday, we had a 6.5 earthquake. It was felt all over the state. ... In fact, up in Sacramento, Governor Schwarzenegger had to grab four women to keep from falling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They had a huge power outage in San Francisco over the weekend. Over 100,000 people were without power. Or as Gray Davis calls it, 'The good old days.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here is an interesting statistic. Listen to this. Do you know how many babies were born exactly nine months after the last power outage in San Francisco? None.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rush Limbaugh now claiming he was blackmailed by his maid. His maid blackmailed him. Yeah, and Strom Thurmond's maid tricked him into getting her pregnant. When are these rich white men gonna stop falling prey to these tricky maids? When is that gonna happen?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to begin the program with good news. It looks like New York has the chance to finish the year with under 600 murders. Yeah. We're not there yet. Everybody has to pitch in and do their part. So please, if you kill someone, dump the body in New Jersey. All right?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody is excited about Christmas. Earlier today, out there in Sacramento, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger had a holiday feel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My Uncle Earl arrived earlier this afternoon. When he showed up, the first thing we did was check for fleas and looked in his mouth with a flashlight. He's fine. He's going to be okay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about this Saddam Hussein, now that he has been in captivity? They say now that he is apparently despondent. He is a broken man. Describe him as a broken man. He sits in his cell all day staring at a picture of George Bush. This also could describe Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, if you are thinking about a gift for Saddam Hussein, how many of you have him on your list? Well, you can't go wrong with the Sharper Image Turbo Nose Clipper.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi denied that he had weapons of mass destruction and this was his quote. He said, 'We have not these weapons.'&quot; Yeah. Yeah, in response, President Bush said, 'Oh, yes, have you.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

Did y'all see Namath with that reporter? What was her name? Suzy Kolber, is that her name? She's an ESPN reporter. She's interviewing him, and he's trying to kiss her. He has his arm around her. He keeps pulling her clothes. She's doing this. You laugh, but hey, Joe Namath, he could be our next governor of California.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Back on that security -- that's a very tough gig. This is a really frightening story. They're now saying some terrorists may be trained pilots working for these foreign airlines. But on the bright side, Islamic fundamentalists don't drink. So if you smell liquor on your pilot's breath, go ahead and get on. He's probably okay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think this is the day we take a moment and be thankful for whatever we have. Don't you feel like that? ... Someone once said -- ever hear this saying?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the latest reports from Iraq say that Saddam Hussein is a broken man without hope. They've been showing him videos of mass graves and his soldiers torturing people, but even that didn't cheer him up, no.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Right now in Iowa, candidate John Kerry driving around in this big bus called the Real Deal Express. He's got this bus, and here's his trick, you see? His campaign is going out to where people are working, and he's meeting people who wouldn't normally come to a campaign rally. That's not campaigning. Isn't that called bothering people? If I wanted to go to see you, I'd go see you. Don't pull into my driveway with your stupid bus. 'Honey, the Kerrys are here!' Great.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On his radio show this week, Rush Limbaugh is blaming all his legal troubles now on the Democrats. You have to understand how Rush Limbaugh thinks, you see? See, Bill Clinton was a real pain in the neck, right? So he got some drugs for the pain, then he got addicted to the pain. He started buying drugs illegally, so this whole thing is Clinton's fault.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, I'm in a good mood. I finally got rid of all my relatives hanging around all over the house. Know what I did? Grilled up a bunch of Washington state beef. Yeah! Hey, who wants some Mad Cow Ribeye?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When that story first broke about the mad cow in Washington, Bill Clinton said, 'here we go again.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Listen to this. Due to the increased terror alert, security's been stepped up at the Sugar Bowl this year. ... Officials will be looking to stop anyone who doesn't belong at the Sugar Bowl, and today USC turned in Oklahoma.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;U.S. officials thought terrorists on those Air France flights might attack Las Vegas, but then the terrorists changed their mind because they want publicity and, as you know, 'What Happens in Vegas, Stays in Vegas.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ben Affleck &quot;visited our soldiers in the Persian Gulf. He was over there for a couple of days, and took along copies of the new movie, 'Paycheck.' ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, the first case of mad cow disease in the United States was discovered in Washington. ... The government said, 'Don't worry, it is not terrorist-related. However, if you are at the airport and you do see a cow acting suspiciously, you should alert authorities.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Federal agents say they're now trying to track down 73 other cows that may have been infected. In fact, earlier today, they found one cow at a farm hiding in a spider hole.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To help find the other cows, the government has just come out with these. These are 'Mad Cow' playing cards.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush says he is still eating beef. He says beef is safe. In fact, President Bush said today, 'Once we stop eating beef, that means the cows have won.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But McDonald's, Burger King and Wendy's say worries about mad cow disease have not affected the sales of their hamburgers. Of course not.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, the government announced they listed a no-fly zone over Las Vegas for security reasons tomorrow night at New Year's Eve. Not because of terrorism, just the airline pilot was so drunk, the last place you need him going is Vegas, basically.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a poll in USA Today, Americans chose President Bush as the most admired man of 2003. That's right. Most admired man. Good for him. Yeah. Yeah, apparently, the President narrowly beat out the guy in the Paris Hilton video.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In California, that's a serious state. In California, a new beer is being sold called 'The Governator,' in honor of Arnold Schwarzenegger. Yeah, apparently, if you drink six of them, you start to talk just like Arnold.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today the government issued some guidelines how to tell if your cow has mad cow disease. Interesting. If it's short-tempered, if it seems confused, if it's foaming at the mouth, in other words, if it's acting like Howard Dean -- there's a good chance your cow could have mad cow disease.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, earlier this week, Howard Dean called President Bush 'the most dangerous administration in his lifetime.' And today, Saddam Hussein said, 'me, too!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's something really frightening. Turns out, 200 keys, 200 keys are missing at our nuclear power plants around the country. Well, they say at the present time, none of the missing keys appear to be related to terrorist activity. They all appear to be just incompetence. Whew! What a relief that is.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, here you go. The Food and Drug Administration is banning the weight loss supplements that contain Ephedra. They say it's been linked to strokes, heart attacks, even death. Hey, it still beats the hell out of diet and exercise.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know, even though Christmas is over, there's still a lot of those annoying Lexus commercials. I saw another one today. You know the one where the couples give each other Lexuses? What is this, some kind of Republican Christmas? What is that? How do these commercials make regular people feel?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This past weekend, it was so cold, when Howard Dean got angry, the foam around his mouth actually froze.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love this story. TV evangelist Pat Robertson said last week that God told him that President Bush is going to win in a landslide. Robertson said -- this is his quote, 'I really believe I'm hearing from the Lord. It's going to be a blowout in 2004.' Now, I am not a Biblical scholar, but I have read the Bible. I don't remember seeing the word 'blowout.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here in California, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger gave his State of the State Address. He called for huge cutbacks in government programs. The biggest cut? Legal services for sexually harassed women. That's the first to go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New Jersey has become the first state to legalize human cloning. New Jersey. Oh, yeah. That's what the world needs, more trashy girls with too much hair spray.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy birthday to Rush Limbaugh. Rush Limbaugh's birthday today. Want to get him a gift? He could use some new medical records. That would be nice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a fascinating book, Pete Rose's new book. In the book, he admits he used to date cocktail waitresses, groupies and strippers. I don't know if that'll keep him out of the Hall of Fame, but he's now the leading candidate for the Democratic nomination.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought this was interesting, did you see 60 Minutes last night here on CBS? That's a good sign. Well, former Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill has written a book about his years with the Bush Administration, and he said that President Bush, when he's in action, now at Cabinet meetings, he was disengaged, he's uninformed, he's distracted, he's passive. And the Democrats are saying to themselves, 'How can we possibly beat this guy?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is in Mexico right now, he's meeting with Mexican President Vincente Fox, or as Bush calls him, 'Chucho.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Friday, President Bush he announces that here's what he wants to do. He wants to go to the moon, and he wants to build like a space station on the moon, and then from the moon, he wants to launch people to Mars. You know what this means, ladies and gentlemen? He's been drinking again. That's what that means.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, I guess you heard today, President Bush announced a major new plan for the United States to put a man on the moon, which would be a really big story if this was 1962.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Put a man on the moon? You know, when Bush said he didn't remember anything about the '60s, he wasn't lying.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this Mars rover, this thing is pretty amazing. Have you seen the pictures? Unbelievable. It's expected to go for its first ride tomorrow, or tonight -- I guess late tonight, or early tomorrow morning. And they're directing the rover by remote control here on earth. This thing's 140 million miles away, they're using remote control. You know, I stand under my garage door for an hour - 'Hey, hey!'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The other big story continues to be President Bush's controversial immigration plan. Bush says he wants to give green cards to illegal immigrants who are willing to take jobs Americans will not take. In fact, I understand because of this, there's now a new act in Vegas, Siegfried and Jose. Yeah, Siegfried and Jose.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday the Pentagon announced that it will soon take over Halliburton's role in transporting fuel to Iraq. The Pentagon's going to do it. They figure, by getting rid of Halliburton, they can cut out the middle man and just screw the American taxpayer directly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, less than one week before the Iowa caucuses. And Senator Joe Lieberman says his campaign is now picking up momentum, which tends to happen when you're rolling downhill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today presidential candidate Wesley Clark called for a new probe into the war in Iraq. He wants to know why he was initially in favor of it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I've been watching all these Democratic candidates, and I finally figured it out. Howard Dean is the mole. See, he's trying to ruin it for the other guys. You see that? It's 'political mole.' That's what they're playing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, whenever I see Dean on the campaign trail, he's always by himself. And according to the New York Times, Dean's wife does not like the spotlight. She doesn't want anything to do with it. You know, if she wanted to stay out of the spotlight, she should have married Dennis Kucinich.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New Jersey has become the first state in the union to legalize human cloning, which surprised me. I thought they already had cloning in Jersey. No? You ever been down to the Jersey Shore and yelled out the name 'Tony?' 20 guys in identical Trans-Ams, 'Yo, yo! Yo!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to the show, I have an announcement. The global warming conference has been canceled.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Are you excited about going to Mars? President Bush wants to go to Mars. He wants to, he says in 20 years they'll put a man on Mars, in 20 years put a man on Mars, and in 30 years, he wants a man on Will and Grace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's news from the world of trans-Atlantic travel. The Queen Mary 2, you know what that is? It the largest ocean liner ever, it's the biggest ocean going sea vessel ever. And it launched its maiden voyage on Monday. I believe no one has boarded anything this large...well, I guess since the Clinton years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush gave a big speech earlier today. I'm sure you all saw it. Their silence was a yes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, this is big. Earlier today, President Bush announced plans to create a permanent lunar space station. That's right. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, President Bush said if the lunar space station works out, then we'll build one on the moon.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new survey about the Democratic candidates for president, most of Howard Dean's support comes from urban voters. Most of Wesley Clark's support comes from rural voters. Yeah. Yeah, the survey also revealed that all of Dennis Kucinich's support comes from his family.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you probably know, yesterday, President Bush announced a new plan to colonize the moon and put a man on Mars by the year 2030. He calls it the 'intergalactic guest worker program.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He feels space aliens will work for a lot less money than illegal aliens. That's basically the way it works.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush also said that, although robots have done well in space, humans still need to see, examine, and touch for themselves. You know who told him that? Governor Schwarzenegger. 'I was a robot. I know. I'd rather touch the other things than the robot.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is also announcing plans for a $1.5 billion election year drive to promote marriage. He wants to promote marriage for a billion and a half dollars. He also wants another $1 billion to send Americans to the moon. See, that's when you know we have a big divorce problem in this country -- when it costs more to keep a couple together than it does to send a man to the moon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The last person to walk on the moon was astronaut Eugene Cernan in 1972. And Cernan said yesterday he'd like to go back and see what it's like now. Like it's changed somehow?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The New York Times is reporting that conservative groups are demanding that President Bush support a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage in next week's State of the Union address. You know, gay marriage is not the problem. How about a ban on celebrity marriages? That's what we need.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former Senator Carol Moseley Braun has dropped out of the race for the Democratic nomination. If you don't know who she is, she's the Democratic candidate who spent less than three hours a day on their hair. She's the one that spent the less amount of time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now that Carol Moseley Braun is out of the race, this will give Dennis Kucinich a firm grasp on last place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Any Dennis Kucinich fans here? I don't want to say Dennis Kucinich is doing poorly, but they're already calling him the 'Iowa carcass.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Governor of Iowa said today, it's still up in the air, he said, 'No one knows what's going to happen on Iowa caucus night.' Probably the same thing that happens in Iowa every night. Nothing!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think we set a new record. We had Pete Rose Monday night, Donald Trump Tuesday night. Al Sharpton on the show tonight. Between the three of them, we had 30 hair stylists quit. They said, 'That's it, we can't..'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Sharpton, he's speaking out. I like Al. He's very critical, even of his own party. Sharpton said the Democratic Party has to stop treating blacks as their mistresses. This is what he said. Sharpton then explained that a mistress is where they take you out to have fun, but they don't take you home. Was that really necessary, to explain what a mistress is to Democrats?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today on the coldest day in over 50 years, Al Gore gave a speech where he attacked President Bush on global warming. Good timing, Al! Hard to believe he lost.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The coldest day of the year! You know, what is it with Al? First he grew a beard right before the terrorist attacks. Remember that? That was smart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now he's talking about global warming in the middle of winter. And I understand next week he's going to cut the ribbon on the new Michael Jackson day care center. You know, this is bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And how is this for stupid? I hope I'm saying this right. A Saudi Arabian man has been charged with carrying fireworks on board a plane heading for Boston. The man's name is Assam Mohammed al Mohabis. I don't want to be insensitive here, but if your name is Assam Mohammed al Mohabis and you're flying to America, why are you carrying fireworks in your bag? That's like a guy from Colombia walking in with a big bag of flour.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought this was kind of interesting. It was like ten degrees here in New York City today and Al Gore, remember Al Gore, used to be Vice President. Actually for a time looked like he would be president. Then that thing in Florida. Al Gore, bless his heart. Today he is giving a speech on global warming. It's ten degrees. Yeah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You folks excited about -- this is really big story. This big Mars rover. What a deal. And we send a thing all the way to Mars. It's like a billion miles away, Mars. It can't get there. It takes a long time, seriously. Finally we land the thing. Have you seen the photographs of Mars? I have never seen clearer, more high resolution photographs of sand and rocks. It's unbelievable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's crazy. Today, the Mars rover. This was a big day. It became untethered, pivoted and stood up. It was just like the end of a Paris Hilton video.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the latest polls -- this is interesting -- the race in Iowa between John Kerry, Howard Dean and Dick Gephardt could end in a three-way tie. Isn't that amazing? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, political experts say there hasn't been a three-way in politics since Bill Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Carol Moseley Braun announced that she was dropping out of the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. Dropping out. Yeah, Braun said she's dropping out 'cause 'I don't want to be remembered as the person who stopped Dennis Kucinich from finishing last.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a brand-new study, most Americans under 25 get their information about politics from the Internet. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, which may explain why the Democratic frontrunner is 'Senator You-Can-Add- Inches-To-Your-Penis.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, the Bush Administration now reportedly planning a new initiative to promote marriage. He wants to promote marriage. And right after it was announced today, of course, Bill Clinton gave the rebuttal.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the New York Post, Clinton has lost almost 20 pounds. He's on the South Beach diet, lost 20 pounds. He said his secret is no more cheeseburgers, no fries, no pizzas, and no desserts. He still orders it, but now he just gives it to his girlfriend.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And conservative groups are demanding that President Bush support a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriages. They feel that, when the Founding Fathers were putting the Constitution together, they made a mistake by not outlawing it. Which, I don't know. You ever see the paintings of those Founding Fathers? Show the paintings. Now, take a look. The powdered wig, the frilly collars. Look at those pedal pushers. I think they were for it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Mars rover taking amazing pictures and sending them back to earth from Mars. They're unbelievable. You seen these pictures? The interesting thing about this vehicle, it's only expected to last about 90 days before it breaks down completely and falls apart. It was a joint venture between NASA and KIA. Basically, that's how they did it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush said again today he wants to send Americans back to the moon, then to Mars, and then onward into space. Well, of course, he realizes America doesn't have any friends on earth any more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, President Bush being criticized a lot for this idea. A lot of people thinking America doesn't need to spend this kind of money going into space. What, are you kidding? As fat as we're getting, we need to go somewhere where we're weightless. We're going to explode here. We're getting bigger and bigger every day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Starbucks has opened their first franchise in Paris, France. But in order to be successful, they had to change the formula. They had to make the coffee much more bitter and weak, you know. Just like the French.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush wants to put a man on the moon by 2015. I'm thinking, Well forget about the moon. Why don't we go to Afghanistan and find Osama bin Laden. How about that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Are you excited about the Democrats who want to be president? It's -- honestly it's an exciting bunch of guys. The frontrunner of course is Howard Dean. And you know, I didn't know this about him, but people are saying he may be too short to be president. I had no idea that he is diminutive. He is a short. He was campaigning at a mall in Iowa and security kept coming up to him and asking, 'Are you lost?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you been hearing about former Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, who has written this book? In the book he says that President Bush at the Cabinet meetings was distracted and disengaged. He was disengaged. I thought that was odd. I got to thinking about it. I believe the last time a president got disengaged was - I think it was when Hillary walked into the Oval Office.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Quick survey -- how many people are following the Democrats in Iowa? Are you following this? How many people know which of the candidates are competing tonight? How many people here don't even know where Iowa is?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, by the time this airs, we should know who won, but, boy, they said this race was so close even Pete Rose wasn't betting on it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The other candidates continue to attack Howard Dean. They question his electability. That's what they call it, 'elect-ability.' They point out that the Democrats need a candidate that can win the most votes. You know, like Al Gore did.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because he's dropped a little bit in the polls for the first time, Howard Dean has begun to wear sweaters. He's wearing sweaters on the campaign trail now to soften his image. You seen Howard Dean in a sweater, huh? He looks like Mr. Rogers with rabies, basically.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, as you know, President Bush has announced plans to send astronauts to Mars. But, you know -- I don't think President Bush really understands our space program. In fact, when he first heard about the Mars rover, he said, 'Hey, if we can put a dog on Mars, we can put a man on Mars.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's some good news. Because the photos sent back show that everything seems to be quiet on Mars, today the Department of Homeland Security has downgraded Mars from the Red Planet to the Yellow Planet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Friday, the United States Army awarded the $1 billion contract to rebuild Iraq's oil industry to Halliburton, the Halliburton Corporation. God, it's like they know somebody or something.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush announced that even though Canada did not support our invasion of Iraq, they will be allowed to bid on Iraqi reconstruction contracts. However, in return, Canada must promise to support our next three invasions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, earlier tonight in Iowa they had the Iowa caucuses, you folks been following the Iowa caucuses? Well, the last word we had was the results are apparently too close to call. Unless you're Dennis Kucinich, and then...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ted Kennedy, Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy is campaigning for John Kerry. And Ted, if you're watching, I have two words for you: Low carbs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So Ted Kennedy is endorsing John Kerry, and I'm thinking to myself, 'Do you really want the endorsement of a guy with a Bloody Mary mustache?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this was exciting and interesting and puzzling, Howard Dean, long- time Democratic frontrunner, finally introduced his wife for the first time during the campaign. After all these weeks and months, the first time he introduces his wife on the campaign. I tell you, these two make the Clintons look close.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love these politicians that go crazy trying to do anything they can to get support. For example, yesterday Howard Dean goes down to Georgia, and he goes to church with Jimmy Carter, see. And today, he shoots a sex video with Paris Hilton. So they'll do anything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The people are always coming up to me...they'll say to me, 'Well, what really is, you have the primaries and you have the caucuses, what is a caucus.' Here, now is what the caucus is. The Iowa caucus is nonbinding. See that's the difference. The Iowa caucus is a nonbinding event, it's like a Britney Spears marriage.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, I guess you know -- John Kerry, the big winner in Iowa last night. John Kerry, the big winner. ... Ted Kennedy introduced Kerry as 'the Comeback Kid.' That used to be Bill Clinton's name on the campaign trail. No, wait. You know, they used to call him the Comeback Kid. Every time he would come back to a city, he would find out if he had a kid or not.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And John Kerry said in his speech last night that this is the beginning of the end of the Bush Administration. I agree. Hey, it may take five years, but believe me, this is coming down.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry's victory over Howard Dean has completely changed the presidential race. Now, instead of a rich, white guy from, you know, from Yale who lives in the White House facing off a rich white guy from Yale who lives in Vermont, he might have to face off against a rich white guy from Yale who lives in Massachusetts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Plus the big surprise -- John Edwards came in second. Edwards is quite eloquent. He said, 'We have two Americas, one for the rich and one for the poor. We have two countries, two tax systems, two school systems, two medical systems.' And today President Bush said, 'Great. Why don't you become president of the crappy America? I'll keep my job.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And good news today for Howard Dean's wife. Looks like she's finally going to get some of that privacy she wanted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, my God. Did you see Dean's speech last night? Oh, my God. Now I hear the cows in Iowa are afraid of getting 'Mad Dean' disease.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me tell you something -- hey, believe me, I'm no pundit. I'm no expert in politics, but I think it's a bad sign when your speech ends with your aide shooting you with a tranquilizer gun.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Dean is a doctor. Man, he acts more like a postal worker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Jeez. I mean, he's a doctor. What kind of bedside manners is that for a doctor? &quot;We're going to pull out your spleen! Then your appendix! Then we're going for your tonsils! Then we're going to take your damn heart and replace it!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Dick Gephardt dropped out of the presidential race today. Because, apparently the country is not ready for a really, really white president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Senator Joe Lieberman, you know, he skipped Iowa. He's now devoting all his energy to losing in New Hampshire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about Dennis Kucinich? Oh, my God. He finished behind Martha Stewart. That's how screwed he is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as you know, NASA has landed the Mars rover on the surface of Mars. It's sending back pictures. Now it's drilling into the surface -- this is fascinating -- to get samples. Have you seen this thing? It looks like a little golf cart with a drill in the front of it. It's like a Republican's dream come true, right? You can play golf and drill for oil at the same time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you very much. How do you do, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you. Thank you. Well, that lasted about as long as Howard Dean- mania.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You folks see the Iowa caucuses last night? How many of you saw the Howard Dean speech? Did you see Howard Dean ranting and raving? How many of you got to see that? Here's a little tip, Howard. Cut back on the red bull. That will do it for you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Howard Dean has been like the frontrunner and then last night he finishes a distant third in Iowa. Here's what happened. This is the way it works. The people in Iowa realized that they didn't want a president with the personality of a hockey dad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Meanwhile, in New Hampshire, Joe Lieberman is not doing very well. Currently, he is two points behind the Taliban candidate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Television networks covered President Bush's annual State of the Union address. And it was...well, it was a real crowd pleaser. Bush promised 16 new contracts to Halliburton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But President Bush's speech was very ambitious. He promised, listen to this, and I think this is what you got to do when you're the President. He promised by the year 2010, we will have a man on Liza Minelli.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, of course, Iowa caucus, y'all followed this. Howard Dean came in a disappointing third place. Third place. Yeah. Yeah, afterwards -- afterwards Dean said, 'Iowa is behind me. Now I'm looking forward to going to New Hampshire and screaming at voters there.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That was crazy last night. He was like the Incredible Hulk last night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday in the Iowa caucuses, Democratic candidate Dennis Kucinich got only 1% of the votes. 1%, yeah. Yeah, apparently Kucinich knew he was in trouble when he saw a sign that said, 'You must be this tall to win the Iowa caucus.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While most TV channels were covering President Bush's State of the Union address, the Cartoon Network aired 'Pokemon.' That's true. That's true. True story. Everyone else showed the address. The Cartoon Network showed 'Pokemon.' True story. Yeah, but don't worry. President Bush has TiVo.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, last night, President Bush gave his State of the Union address, interrupted 70 times by applause and 45 times by really big words.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night the President's address was exactly three years from when he was first sworn in. Think of what America was like back there in 2001. The Eagles are this short of winning the big one, right? Came this close. Pete Rose was banned from the Hall of Fame, and Howard Dean was a guy with no chance of being elected president. It's amazing.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In last year's State of the Union address, Bush said there was no doubt Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. Last night, Bush said they had weapons of mass destruction-related program activity. What's he going to say next year? 'Iraq had weaponishy thingamajig watchmacallits. You know, those weapony things.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many watched American Idol last night? How many watched the President's speech? There's the problem right there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, the Democrats should run on American Idol against Bush, so this time next year, we could have a President Clay Aiken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush also said last night that our children must be taught how to read. He said if his aides had never learned to read, they'd never be able to tell him what was in the newspaper every day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush also said last night that Americans are the hardest- working people in the world. Well, duh, the problem with the economy, everybody's got to work two jobs just to stay here. We're working our ass off! What do you expect? Please!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush also says that American workers will need new skills to get the new jobs in the 21st century. Some of the skills we're going to need are Spanish, Chinese, and Korean, because that's where the jobs went, basically!&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And who better than Bush for an example of what can happen when you take a job without any training.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about Ted Kennedy shaking his head, rolling his eyes? He looked like a bobblehead doll going down a dirt road, didn't he?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, it's interesting, but Kennedy and Bush -- they really haven't gotten along since they both gave up drinking. You know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush also spoke about the dangers posed by people who spread sexually transmitted diseases. See, typical Republican. Always taking a shot at Clinton. There's no reason.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush also came out against gay marriage. He came out for abstinence for teenagers. And he came out against performance- enhancing drugs. So he's against sex, drugs, and gays. Well, there goes California, pretty much.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, at the end of the President's speech, he said, 'All of us must work together to counter the negative influences of our culture and what it sends -- and that we send the right message to our children. We must counteract the negative influences of our culture.' He just spent an hour talking about how wonderful America is. Then he goes, 'By the way, it's corrupting our children. Good night, everybody!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Under everyone's seat in the House of Representatives last night, there was a foil package containing a hood in case there was a chemical or biological attack. One embarrassing moment, Trent Lott opened it up and said, 'Shouldn't there be a white robe with this?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Homeland Security chief Tom Ridge raised the security alert to a code red. Apparently, Howard Dean has escaped. Yes, Howard Dean has escaped.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see Dean's crazed speech the other night? Yelling and screaming. I realize why his wife won't campaign with him now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, Dean has a new slogan. 'Aaaaaghh!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Dick Gephardt, who campaigned hard -- oh, boy, he worked hard, came in a distant fourth. He has dropped out of politics. That's it. He's out for good. See, I like that. That should be the rule for every politician. You lose once, you're out of politics for good. You can never come back. There you go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and jury selection began this week on the Martha Stewart trial. They're picking the jury, which is tough for her lawyers -- trying to find homemakers who are also billionaires.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I think Martha's getting a little bit nervous. Like, today, she was spotted going over her financial records with club soda and lemon juice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Legendary country singer Jimmy Dean said the Sarah Lee Corporation has dropped him as spokesman for the sausage company he founded over three decades ago. He was dropped from his own company. You know something? If your last name is Dean, this has not been a good week for you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You folks see President Bush's State of the Union address last night? How many of you got a chance to see the...yeah. How about that surprise announcement, President Bush said last night that Howard Dean has been captured and he's in the hands of interrogators, amazing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're going to South Carolina, we're going to Arizona! Oklahoma, North Dakota, New Mexico! And Pennsylvania, we're going to Ohio, Rhode Island, we're going to Wyoming, we're going to Hawaii!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I asked around, and God forbid, I should be the last one to criticize, but I think maybe Howard Dean has a bit of a problem, because earlier today during a debate in New Hampshire he bit off Joe Lieberman's ear.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Indiana, Texas and Alabama and Oregon! California! Florida! Illinois, Alaska, Georgia! Then we're going to Puerto Rico!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, last night in his speech, George Bush had a lot of new proposals, listen to this. He's announced that he's adding aquamarine to the terror alert color chart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was a touching moment during the speech last night when President Bush introduced Eliza Minelli's battered husband, he was up in the...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But you know, due to budget crunches, Bush has had to scale back some of the programs and he has a program new program, it's called 'Leave a Couple of Kids Behind.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Japan, Indonesia, France and England! And Germany! And Brazil! And the Philippines! And China! And the Virgin Islands!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Then Bush's speech, you know, it was interrupted by applause 68 times, interrupted 68 times by applause, yeah. Five times by Ted Kennedy getting up and going to take a leak.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Montana! Kentucky!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I keep hearing of all these people that have lost weight eating low-carb foods, cutting out all the carbs from their diet. Where are these people? I don't see them. ... Actually, it does seem to work for some people. I understand Dick Gephardt was on it, and now he's completely disappeared. So I don't know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I got to tell you something. I had a nightmare last night. Oh, man, I woke up. I was sweating. I dreamed that Howard Dean had somehow gotten a hold of a weapon of mass destruction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's see what's going on with Dr. Dean and Mr. Hyde, as they're calling him on the campaign trail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Howard Dean's staff is doing everything they can to try and mellow him out after that shouting incident in Iowa. In fact, today, I understand they gave him a tennis ball to chew on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What was that noise he made? 'Yeow!' What was that? Hey, at least Clinton had the decency to make those kind of noises in the privacy of the Oval Office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a huge turnaround, Senator John Kerry has taken a ten-point lead over Dean in the polls in New Hampshire. And aides to Howard Dean are still trying to figure out -- who's going to tell him? 'I'm not going to tell him. You tell him.' 'I'm not going to tell him.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess Dean's wife, Judith Steinberg, she made a rare appearance in New Hampshire. She's a doctor, so I guess they brought her in to stop the hemorrhaging in the campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry apologized this week for saying that, when he returned from Vietnam in 1969, John Edwards was still in diapers. And John Edwards said that, in 1969, he was sitting around the kitchen, you know, sitting around the kitchen table with his parents trying to figure out how to pay for college. And George Bush said, in 1969, he was trying to figure out 'where the hell I parked my car.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Edwards continuing. He came in second in Iowa, you know, and Edwards keeps saying there are two Americas. And today President Bush said, 'No that's wrong, there's only one America.' And then he repeated that in Spanish, you know, for the other America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're learning more and more about Senator John Edwards. Did you know much about this guy? Turns out he's a multimillion-dollar personal injury attorney. Did you know that? That's how he made his money. In fact, that's how he's going to solve the deficit. Go up to the Capitol, trip on the steps, fake a back injury, collect billions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Democratic candidate Wesley Clark revealed this week that he got a half a million dollars last year lobbying the Bush Administration for a security software firm. You know what you call a Democrat who makes half a million bucks lobbying the Bush Administration? A Republican! Hello?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Richard Gephardt, who came in fourth in Iowa, says he is dropping out of politics. See, that's not the quality I want in my leader. A quitter. I mean, George Bush lost the entire 2000 election to Al Gore. Did he quit? No. He went on to become President of the United States.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I saw something at the end of the State of the Union speech. It was so subtle, but I'd never seen this on a State of the Union speech before. Run the end of Bush's speech.&quot; President Bush: &quot;May God continue to bless America.&quot; Announcer: &quot;Tonight's presidential State of the Union address was brought to you by Halliburton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In his speech the other night, President Bush asked Congress to preserve the institution of marriage. You know, asking a bunch of congressmen to preserve marriage is like asking Michael Jackson to help with the 'Leave no Child Behind' program. I'm sorry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush also said we might have to have a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage. And this amendment -- gay men would only be allowed to marry Liza Minnelli.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Ohio legislature approved a ban on same-sex marriage. I understand Kentucky now is thinking about a ban on same-sibling marriage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in Iran, the government's religious authorities have banned half the candidates from running in their national elections next month because they're too liberal. They can't run in Iran. This ban was issued by their religious cleric, Ayatollah Ashcroft, I believe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, today, NASA reported they can't reach the Mars rover. The Mars rover is stuck up there, and they can't seem to get through. In fact, NASA brought in an expert. They're trying to shock it. They do that? They send a shock wave to try and make the Mars rover react. Well, take a look.&quot; Howard Dean: &quot;Yeaaa!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that Howard Dean? Did you see that thing after the...did you see him screaming at everybody. 'Then we're going to Oregon and Las Vegas and Milwaukee and Washington and California and Arizona and New Mexico and Montana and Wyoming.' I don't know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was like at a rally up there in New Hampshire and somebody was heckling him. So here is what he did. He started to sing the national anthem. He is singing the Star Spangled Banner while the guy is heckling him. Then he followed up with 'A Man Loves a Woman.' It was beautiful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm starting to worry about Howard Dean. He was debating earlier tonight. He was debating Dennis Kucinich and he head-butted him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I really believe about Howard Dean, I think we're about a day away from him announcing that he is addicted to pain killers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a special anniversary today. Do you have any idea what the anniversary is today. 6th anniversary. 6 years ago today -- President Clinton said to the American people, 'I did not have sex with that woman.' Six years ago today. ... That's right. I did not have -- or as we call it here at the Late Show, the 'Dawn of the Golden Age of Comedy.' That's right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We first told this joke July 8th, 1999. President Clinton visited a Sioux reservation in South Dakota. The chief presented him with a new intern, Kneeling Fox.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top Ten Ways I, Howard Dean, Can Turn Things Around (as read by Howard Dean): '10. Switch to decaf. 9. Unveil a new slogan: 'Vote for Dean and get one dollar off your next purchase at Blimpie. 8. Marry Rachel on the final episode of 'Friends.' 7. Don't change a thing. It's going great. 6. Show a little more skin. 5. Go on 'American Idol' and give 'em a taste of these pipes. 4. Start working out and speaking with an Austrian accent. 3. I can't give specifics yet, but it involved Ted Danson. 2. Fire the staffer who suggested that we do this lousy Top Ten list instead of actually campaigning. 1. Oh, I don't know - maybe fewer crazy, red-faced rants?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Political experts say Democratic Senator John Edwards did well in Iowa because he emphasizes optimism and kindness. Yeah, it doesn't always work though. Today, Edwards tried to kiss a baby, but it turned out to be Dennis Kucinich.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, listen to this. The good news -- the Mars rover and NASA are communicating with each other once again. That's good news. The bad news -- Ben and J. Lo aren't. Yeah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The cold wave is still covering parts of New England. In fact, in some parts of the East, temperatures are dropping faster than Howard Dean's numbers. Oh, my gosh.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll tell you, that little outburst in Iowa, I think that really cost him. But God bless him, he's managed to turn it into a positive. He's turned it around. Have you seen this commercial that's running in Vermont? Take a look.&quot; Announcer: &quot;Howard Dean is having a huge nationwide TV blowout! He's selling TVs for less at locations in...&quot; Dean: &quot;California and Texas and New York and South Dakota and Oregon and Washington! Yeah!&quot; Announcer: &quot;At Crazy Howard's TV and Appliances.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, the Democratic debate -- how many watched the Democratic debate last night? ... Much more toned-down, Howard Dean, he's much quieter. So apparently, the medication is working.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Democratic presidential candidate Joe Lieberman insists -- he insisted that he is not thinking about the polls, which is ironic, because the polls show nobody's thinking about him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today up in New Hampshire, Dennis Kucinich -- he's another presidential candidate -- went on a ten-stop bus tour. Finally, the driver said, 'Look, pal, it's the end of the line, you've got to get off.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in his State of the Union address the other night, President Bush said our nation must defend the sanctity of marriage. And let me tell you something, he is very serious about this sanctity of marriage thing. In fact, earlier today, he had Britney Spears arrested and sent to Guantanamo Bay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is what I love about President Bush. Yesterday, during his speech in New Mexico, President Bush thanked the local Congressman Steve Pierce for being there. And Bush said, 'He's a freshman. That's first year.' You ever notice how when Bush has this habit of stating the obvious, and then he looks at the crowd like he should get credit for knowing that? 'Next year, he'll be a sophomore. That's second year.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, a former Enron accountant surrendered. That's what they said on the news. He surrendered. It's so dramatic. He surrendered. 'All right. Drop your number 2 pencil! Don't be a fool, Marvin!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier in the week, former Enron executive Andrew Fastow pleads guilty to fraud, got a ten-year sentence. I'd love to see these guys go to prison. 'Help me!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, he's now expected to turn state's evidence and testify against former Enron chairman Ken Lay, who President Bush used to call 'Kenny-Boy.' President Bush used to call him 'Kenny-Boy.' That's not the nickname you want to have when you go to prison, 'Kenny-Boy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But then again, it's still a lot better than being known as 'Mr. Lay.' Okay, still better than that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As I mentioned, NASA has made contact once again with the Mars rover. As you know, the rover stopped working for 24 hours, then it started up again. You know what I think? I think it just got bored. It's going, 'Hey, how many pictures of rocks do you want? It's all rocks!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former President Bill Clinton says he lost so much weight with his new diet, he has to get all new clothes. That's what he said today. At least that's what he told Hillary when she walked in and caught him with his pants down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new study by the Centers for Disease Control, obesity costs taxpayers $75 billion a year. That works out to $175 per person. You know what that means? That means obesity is taking food out of our mouths.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, we should tax people according to their weight. Like you're writing your tax form -- how much you weigh, multiply by 10. We would have the deficit paid off like that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have big weekend ahead of me. Listen to this, Howard Dean has joined my anger management class.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was kind of an unusual thing happen in court today. Right in the middle of the court session, the judge allowed Martha Stewart to approach the bench and decoupage it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This was good, earlier tonight on ABC, Howard Dean and his wife, who doesn't appear often with Howard Dean. She helped him out on the campaign trail, once. These two make the Clintons look close.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Howard Dean and his wife were interviewed by Diane Sawyer. I think the interview went pretty well. They only had to use the pepper spray on him twice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday was the 6th anniversary of President Clinton's 'I did not have sex with that woman' statement. Were you aware of that? Six years ago yesterday, he went on television and said, 'I did not have sexual relations with that woman!' I actually felt that his behavior...he didn't think that qualified as sex. I was thinking to myself, 'Gee, if that happened to me, I think I would count it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big Democratic presidential debate last night. Oh, yeah, political experts say that during last night's Democratic presidential debate, they've analyzed it, they say nobody stood out, and nobody made any big mistakes. Yeah, yeah. In a related story, nobody watched.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, during the Democratic presidential debate, Howard Dean started off by apologizing to the crowd for having a cold. Yeah. Yeah, then John Kerry apologized for once having a cold while serving his country in Vietnam.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what's interesting -- just because a movie star wins a Golden Globe, that doesn't necessarily mean they'll get the Oscar. You know what I'm saying? The Golden Globes are kind of like the Iowa caucus for actors. You know, it gives you an idea of what's happening.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, another big surprise yesterday was 'Lost in Translation.' Not the movie -- President Bush's explanation of what happened to the weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and tomorrow of course, the big primary in New Hampshire. Very exciting. John Kerry has the lead. Howard Dean has the momentum. I understand Dennis Kucinich has the bird flu.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's see what's going on with Howard Dean, or as the kids call him, 'Old Yeller.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if you watched the debate the other night, but Howard Dean was hoarse. I can't imagine how he lost his voice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They say that little outburst that Dean had in Iowa may have cost him some standing in the polls, and to make it worse, it looks like today he might have lost his endorsement deal with Snuggle fabric softener.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many saw his interview the other night with Diane Sawyer? Actually, he gave a pretty good interview. He was honest. He said, 'I'm a human being. I have all kinds of warts.' And today Bill Clinton said, 'You too? You know, I've got...'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And campaigning in New Hampshire, General Wesley Clark called the Republican Party 'a heartless organization.' He said that's the main reason he quit it four months ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Democratic candidate Joe Lieberman unveils his anti-poverty plan. Well, talk about taking a stand on the tough issues, huh? Of all the pro- poverty people out there, huh? I wonder how he feels about hunger. I'm against it, you know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a poll on Playboy.com, 46% of men surveyed think Al Sharpton is the most well-endowed candidate. While 24% feel that John Edwards is. Let me tell you something right here, okay? If you're a guy and you're on the Playboy Website and all you're thinking about is how well-endowed the candidates are, you're on the wrong Website!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Vice President Dick Cheney is in Italy today. He brushed up on some Italian before he went over there. He learned a couple of Italian phrases. He learned, 'We are proud to have you as an ally.' He learned how to say, 'You have a beautiful country.' And he learned how to say, 'Please call an ambulance, I am having a heart attack.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's some good news -- Mars' second rover Opportunity landed successfully on Mars over the weekend, very exciting. Scientists are now wondering what kind of photographs it'll send back. Gee, I don't know, maybe pictures of rocks, do you think maybe?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, the scientific community was pretty excited this week because the Mars orbiter confirmed there is water on Mars. And today President Bush said, 'Yeah, yeah, fine. Oil, is there any oil?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And on Friday, the world champion Florida Marlins visited the White House. President Bush said the Florida Marlins' line-up was 'pesky at the top, tough in the middle, and reliable at the bottom.' No, I'm sorry, that was Ben Affleck talking about J. Lo. I'm sorry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to this week's Time magazine, a company in Croatia is making a cell phone that's also a gun. A cell phone gun. How many of these are they going to sell in LA? Now you can drive in your car, talk on the phone, and shoot people all at the same time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With the vote just hours away, the latest Reuters/MSNBC/Zogby poll shows Senator John Kerry's lead a mere 9 points over Howard Dean. Dean spent some of his final hours in New Hampshire talking to reporters aboard his campaign vehicle, Anger Force One, before addressing the faithful at a rally.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Newsweek poll said that, if the elections were held today, John Kerry would beat bush, 49% to 46%. Today, President Bush called Newsweek magazine 'a threat to world peace.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about this John Edwards guy? This is an interesting character. You know, doesn't he look like the guy from the TV commercial who finally asks his doctor if Viagra was right for him? Doesn't he look like that guy?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Right before a primary, the guys love hanging out at the local diner talking to real people about real issues for real Americans. Until the primary is over, it's like, 'Hey, it's been real. See you in four years. Good night, everybody!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, the second Mars rover landed successfully on Mars. And you know who was in Pasadena to congratulate the scientists -- this was on the news yesterday? Both Arnold Schwarzenegger and Al Gore. They showed them together. It was like a convention of robots.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the New York Post, Bill Clinton -- man, one of the Clinton jokes got in -- Bill Clinton has lost so much weight on the South Beach diet, had to get some new clothes.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today was the first day of 'The People versus Martha Stewart' trial, or as Martha calls it, 'The Little People versus Martha Stewart.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In his opening statement today, Martha Stewart's lawyer said Martha Stewart has worked most of her life to improve the quality of life for others. And that's right. What does she get out of it? A measly billion dollars.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, here you go. Oscar nominations came out today. Up for best actor, Sean Penn for 'Mystic River,' Jude Law for 'Cold Mountain,' and of course, George W. Bush for 'Iraqi Weapons of Mass Destruction.' Yeah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Elsewhere in New Hampshire, Senator Joe Lieberman in single digits in the polls despite moving to the state five weeks ago, remained optimistic to the end.&quot; Lieberman: &quot;I feel great, it's a beautiful day.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He won by 39% of the vote, which is pretty good. Which begs the question -- so, John, why the long face? Hey!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, real movement in the Kerry campaign now. His poll numbers are moving, donations are moving, endorsements are moving. The only thing not moving about John Kerry -- his hair. His hair does not move.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator John Edwards of North Carolina made a pretty good showing. You know, a lot of people say that John Edwards may be too good- looking to be taken seriously. Boy, do I know how that feels.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The guy -- he came in fifth. The man skipped Iowa. Moved to New Hampshire to do this. He came in fifth! Even Seabiscuit's going, 'Leave him and give it up. It's not going to happen.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, the rumor is Lieberman may be suspending his campaign. He says he's going to pool all his remaining resources and just play the lotto. The odds are better.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know, the Oscar nominations came out yesterday. Finally, some good news for Dennis Kucinich. Do you know about this? He was nominated in the claymation category, so that's good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kucinich is &quot;running for president. He got 1% of the vote in New Hampshire. 1%. And the sad part is, there's a 3% margin of error.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That means Kucinich could actually owe votes. He could owe people votes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Howard Dean announced today he will campaign in seven states. The states are rage, frenzy, fury, wrath, fever, agitation and delirium.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday at the Vatican in Rome, Vice President Dick Cheney had a sit-down meeting with the Pope. The Pope took one look at Cheney and immediately started administering last rites.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The jury from the Martha Stewart trial has been chosen. Eight women, four men, that's the jury. And the bad news for Martha -- none of the men are gay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what the 'butterfly effect' is? Do you know what that refers to? That's a theory that, when a butterfly flaps its wings in one part of the world, it can have an impact halfway around the world. You don't confuse this with the Bill Clinton butterball effect. That's where a president has sex with a chubby girl and the effects are felt halfway around the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, in his big victory speech the other night, Senator John Kerry said he wanted to defeat George Bush and the economy of privilege. Then he hugged his wife Theresa, heir to the multimillion-dollar Heinz food fortune.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now it's starting to get nasty. The latest is these rumors going around that Senator Kerry has had botox shots. Does anybody care? Do you care about that? I think the only thing people care about is whether Howard Dean has had all of his distemper shots.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now there's a rumor Al Sharpton may have had breast reduction surgery.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, Senator Kerry's lucky. He's got millions of dollars to spend to make his face look good. Poor Dennis Kucinich, he has to use a steam iron to get the wrinkles out of his face.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But God bless Dennis Kucinich. He's doing terrible. He keeps running. In fact, his slogan is, 'Don't look back.' Of course, he doesn't have to look back. There's nobody behind him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, political experts are saying the reason John Kerry's doing so well is because he is electable, that's the term they use. Electable. So is Al Gore, he even got elected and it didn't help him at all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Howard Dean is fighting back. He said about his campaign shake- up -- you know, he replaced his campaign manager and other people -- Howard Dean said, 'From now on, you will see a leaner, meaner organization.' Meaner? How scary -- what, is he going to be biting people now?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wesley Clark -- anybody for him? You know, this guy's interesting because he had spoken now both in favor and against the decision to go to war in Iraq. In fact, this weekend in South Carolina, he's going to be debating himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This has been a tough week for President Bush. Yesterday, the former US chief weapons inspector, David Kay, testified before Congress about the weapons of mass destruction. Did you hear about this? He said, 'We were almost all wrong.' You never hear a politician say that. He said, 'We were almost all wrong.' President Bush hadn't heard those words since he took his SATs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me tell you something. There might not have been any weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, but you gotta give President Bush credit for one thing he was right about. Turns out there are rocks on Mars.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the winter storms continue to batter New York City. Man, it was cold back East. But I thought this was nice. Today, Martha Stewart gave each and every one of the jurors a $40,000 mink coat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you, Martha Stewart's lawyer didn't win any points with the jury today when he said, 'Martha is a person who is just like you, if you were perfect.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of Martha's attorneys called the government's case against her today guesswork. That's what he called it, guesswork. Unlike Martha's stock trading, which had no guesswork at all. That was based on solid insider information.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel great. I'm on the new Joe Lieberman diet. Did I tell you about this? Anybody on this? The Joe Lieberman diet. No matter what I do, I just keep losing and losing and losing.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, there was another Democratic presidential debate. How many watched it? Nobody? In fact, the first question the moderator asked Dennis Kucinich, he said, 'What are you doing here? Can't you take a hint? It's over!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't want to say Dennis Kucinich is doing badly, but last night, his campaign was featured on the CBS show 'Without A Trace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's starting to get nasty. Last night during the debates, John Edwards said, 'A President must be able to walk and chew gum at the same time.' I don't know. Shouldn't the qualifications be a little tougher than that? Aren't we lowering the bar just a little too much?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, today, President Bush responded. He said, 'Chewing gum and walking's not hard. Chewing a pretzel -- oh, that's tricky.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's so stupid how petty these things get. A number of plastic surgeons are claiming that looking at John Kerry now as opposed to a few months ago -- they believe he's had botox shots. They claim a number of his worry lines have vanished. They haven't vanished. Just Howard Dean is wearing them now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Howard Dean announced this week that his staff is leaner and meaner. Leaner, because he's letting some of them go, and meaner, because he's not paying them anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dean announced he's pulling his TV ads off this week, pulling them off, pulling them off, and he's asked his staff to skip paychecks for the next couple of weeks because they're out of money. See, this way, he can keep the campaign going to explain to the American people how he's the best guy to balance the budget.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And earlier this week, Vice President Dick Cheney met with the Pope at the Vatican. Did you see him on the news? He got down on his knees, clutched his heart, and then keeled over. I don't know what happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, today is Vice President Dick Cheney's birthday. He's 63. But in heart attack years, that's 190, I believe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And they had a pretty wild party. I understand a registered nurse jumped out of a giant bran muffin. What a party. Huge, huge party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, listen. If you're thinking of getting the Vice President a gift, you can't do wrong with signing your organ donor card.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What a crowd. You sound like Bill Clinton after watching the lingerie bowl. Yeah!'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wasn't it a great game? Boston Red Sox and the Panthers both played a great game. Did I say Red Sox? It's Monday. I was at a party. The Patriots and the Panthers. You know why I did that? Because I lost 1,000 bucks. I bet that Janet Jackson would show her left breast.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you watch that halftime show? Man. Finally, a halftime show for straight guys.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know the whole deal. Janet was doing a duet with Justin Timberlake, and at the end, he ripped off part of her costume, exposing one of her breasts, which is kind of ironic. For once, a Jackson getting molested. Has that ever happened?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Justin Timberlake, God bless him, I love when they get handlers and lawyers and PR people. What did he call this? A 'wardrobe malfunction.' That's what he said. That's what he called it. A 'wardrobe malfunction.' What was the malfunction? What, were both breasts supposed to pop out?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today, CBS, they apologized for Janet showing her breast. Forget that. How about CBS apologizing for Richard showing his fat ass on 'Survivor?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love how high and mighty they get. CBS said that moment did not conform to CBS broadcast standards. What standards? They showed a commercial with a horse farting in a woman's face. Where are these standards?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What standards? People act like they're so shocked at seeing a breast in the halftime show. Do you watch the Super Bowl? Every commercial was for some kind of impotency drug. They finally show something that might give you a real erection, and, oh, my God, what are we going to do?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today the chairman of the FCC announced he is launching an immediate and swift investigation into what they're calling 'Nipplegate.' That's what this is. Nipplegate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nipplegate. Immediate and swift investigation. However, we still have to wait until next year to find out why we went to war with Iraq. But we'll find out what happened with her breast probably in 48 hours.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today is Groundhog Day. Happy Groundhog Day, everybody. This year, President Bush saw his shadow, and it was John Kerry. Hey, what are the odds of that?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, on Groundhog Day, the old-timers, they feel they can predict whether we'll have an early spring or six more weeks of winter by whether or not the groundhog sees his shadow, or, as President Bush calls that, 'reliable intelligence.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A spokesman for the military said today they expect to capture Osama bin Laden later this year. I understand they're shooting for the first week in November.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush said today he now wants to know the facts. He wants to know the facts about Iraq's weapons. You know, before we do something stupid like go to war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what's interesting, during his testimony last week before the Senate Armed Services Committee, former US chief weapons inspector David Kay, he defended President Bush for saying Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. Kay blamed the intelligence community. And then he said, and I quote, he doesn't want anyone 'confusing President Bush with the intelligence community.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the state of Wisconsin says it will now give people a $10,000 tax donation for donating an organ. You can knock $10,000 off your taxes if you donate an organ. How creepy is that? You're filling out a joint return with the wife. 'Honey, how many kidneys you got? Put me down for 20 grand.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, all the excitement during half time, the game is interrupted when this naked guy runs onto the field. And he's got like a Website address all over his body, printed on the back side of him and I'm thinking 'Wow, that Howard Dean is really desperate.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many of you saw that thing with Janet Jackson? I'll be honest, I was happy to see that happen, that Janet Jackson thing, because that meant for one night I wasn't the biggest boob on CBS.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I guess the guy, what's his name, Justin Timberlake? Yeah, he's saying that the problem was a ward robe malfunction. I was thinking, 'Gees, the last time I was involved in a wardrobe malfunction, I became a father!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Then of course, after the game, President Bush calls the winning team, he calls the Patriots. And listen to this, former President Clinton called Janet Jackson. It's crazy!&quot;</SPAN></P>
