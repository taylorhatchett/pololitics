<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mexico's economy has been on the upswing the last couple of years. It's unbelievable. They're getting investors from companies all over the world. In fact, Mexico is now home to 11 million undocumented Americans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, President Obama gave the commencement speech at Ohio State University. He said, 'I dare you to do better.' That's what he told the students. 'I dare you to do better.' To which the students yelled back, 'No, we dare you to do better.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to the US Geological Survey, there are 7.4 billion barrels of recoverable oil in North Dakota. And today, Dick Cheney said if we had known how much oil they had, we would have invaded North Dakota years ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama has changed his mind. He decided to support the morning after pill being available over the counter. ... President Obama finally saw an episode of 'Teen Mom.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;PETA is really upset at Chris Christie for killing a spider in front of a group of school children. ... Governor Christie said, 'If PETA's upset by that, they do not want to know what I had for lunch today.' Apparently Orb is missing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;George W. Bush's nephew, George P. Bush, is running for office in Texas. Yeah, he says the 'P' stands for 'Pretend you've never heard the name George W. Bush.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A company is coming out with a beer drone - a beer drone to deliver beer to attendees at music festivals. ... And in a related story, everyone's now fine with drones.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Obama spoke at Ohio State's graduation and told their students that it's their responsibility to make the world a better place. Which got awkward, when they were like, 'Wait, isn't that literally your responsibility?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some experts are saying that the 2016 Democratic presidential primary could come down to Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden. Biden is calling her 'a worthy opponent,' and Hillary's calling him 'practice.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Joe Biden could be running against Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination. Even though the election is a few years off, we thought it would be helpful to show a side-by-side comparison to see some of their differences. Take a look. Hillary wants to bridge the gap between Democratic and Republican leaders. Biden wants to bridge the gap between Marvel and DC superheroes. Hillary has had to fight against a sexist political system. Biden has had to fight against the safety cap on his Flintstones vitamins. ... Hillary has already imagined what it would be like to sit in the President's chair. Biden has already spent hours sitting in it and spinning around. ... Hillary believes her greatest asset is her experience at dealing with complicated international issues. Biden just laughed at the word 'asset.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope you had a great weekend. I did. I spent it at the big, annual NRA meeting in Houston, Texas. Not to be confused with the daily NRA meeting that is Houston, Texas. And this year's theme was accessories - like pink assault rifles and bra holsters. Now, fellows can brag about getting to Second Amendment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One thing I heard repeatedly down there this weekend is that Obama is coming for our guns. Now, I'm not one to believe in far-out conspiracy theories, probably because the government implanted a chip in my brain that controls my thoughts. But, folks, I've had my eyes opened to some disturbing truths that raise troubling questions. Like, what did they know? When did they know it? And what am I talking about? Which brings me to my new segment exposing vast government conspiracies, 'Stephen Colbert's Bat[bleep] Serious.' Now, folks, I've wanted to do this segment for a long time. But I haven't. Why not? We'll look into that next time. But tonight's topic: Are they coming after our guns? No. They're coming after our bullets. ? Nation, follow me down the rabbit hole. If it even is a rabbit and not a groundhog in a costume. The Federal government's suspicious ammo hoarding was first noticed by vigilant online conspiracy forums before it was picked up by conservative radio hosts and then eventually made its way out to the farthest fringe elements of our society - Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Leading the congressional charge is Senator James Inhofe, if this is James Inhofe and not a groundhog in a costume. Senator Ground-hofe here recently introduced a bill that would ban Federal agencies from buying more ammunition if it currently possesses more than its monthly averages during the Bush Administration. Yes, not including the ammo that ended up in the faces of the friends of Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, folks, a lot of news outlets, including Fox News, say that they have debunked the bullet conspiracy theory, but I say it's already started. Because out of fear of government hoarding, ammo sales have skyrocketed making it harder to find ammo, which can only mean that the government is hoarding it, which means we have to buy more ammo before the government gets it all, but there's none left because we bought it. Oh, my God. It's too late. The feds already have us outgunned. Well, they're not going to take me alive. ? Well, that's it for tonight's 'Bat[bleep] Serious.' Join me next time when I ask the question, 'Did Bigfoot help Lee Harvey Oswald build Stonehenge?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While New Jersey Governor Chris Christie was speaking to a group of schoolchildren the other day, a spider crawled out near him on one of the kids' desks and Christie killed the spider. Now, this is true. PETA has lodged a complaint against him for killing the spider. ... You know, usually when Christie attacks something that has six legs or more, it's a turducken, you know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Chris Christie also revealed he had lap band surgery back in February. There have been rumors he had a gastric bypass or he might have had his stomach stapled. No, he had the lap band. And President Obama wished him well, which is nice. In fact, Obama is thinking about having Joe Biden's mouth stapled.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Couple days ago, President Obama played golf. Went out with three or four Congressmen, Senators, they were playing golf, one of them said to him, 'Mr. President, what is your handicap?' Talking about golf. And he said, 'I'll tell you, my handicap, the Republicans.' That's what he said. One guy had a hole in one! You know what the odds are of a hole in one? 13,000-1. Give you an idea, those odds are just a little better than passing gun control laws. Just a little better.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. Did you hear about this? He had the stomach surgery so he won't be so big. ... But his family gave him a choice, they said, 'Look, you either have that surgery or get your own zip code.' ... And the governor is now saying that his decision has nothing to do with 2016, which, by the way, is his cholesterol.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New Jersey Governor Chris Christie revealed that he underwent a surgery that restricts the amount of food he can eat. As a result, 12 animals have been removed from the endangered species list.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When asked if Hillary Clinton will run for president, Bill Clinton said, 'She's having a little fun being a private citizen.' Then he added, 'Not Bill Clinton-fun, but fun, nonetheless.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Texas man has fired the first ever gun created by a 3D printer. Which raises the question - don't you think a gun created by a printer would jam?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, President Obama and Joe Biden met with South Korean President Park Geun-hye, who is known as South Korea's Iron Lady. Or as Biden put it, 'Can you introduce me to Iron Man?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Biden gave advice on how to avoid war with North Korea. Or, in other words, I think we're going to war with North Korea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Republican Senator Saxby Chambliss ? that sounds like a pimp name. Well anyways, he's a Republican Senator who was playing golf with the President and actually shot a hole in one. ... Saxby immediately started bragging. He was like, 'How does that feel?' And Obama's like, 'I don't know, like winning two elections in a row?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is losing weight. ? Some say that he's running for president, that it's a sure sign. Because why else would a 50-year old man with young children and a loving family take steps to address obesity and extend his life. Why else? It is a classic presidential run tell.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, I am interrupting tonight's regularly scheduled broadcast to bring you breaking news. Repeat: Tonight's Colbert report will not be seen, because there has been a major development in the investigation into the tragic attack on our embassy in Benghazi, Libya. Since last September, Fox News has been pursuing this story doggedly to uncover how the Administration blew it, when they blew it, why they blew it, and how they will continue to have blown it. ? Well, buckle up, folks, because this story is about to take off like a rocket ship to planet Scandal Town. ? Folks, this is the best possible kind of political story. We have no idea what's in it, and it's going to be explosive. It's the Taco Bell of breaking news.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Referring to Tuesday's SC1 special election) &quot;My sister lost. How could this happen? I was so sure Lulu (Colbert Busch) had won because CNN called it for Sanford. But the voters ? what can I say ? the voters of South Carolina have spoken. Mark Sanford beat my sister, and I believe that means Mark Sanford is now my sister. And on behalf of my entire family, I want to say we're deeply sorry about him. Now I know how Kevin Manson must have felt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love my sister. And I'm so proud of her. But I just don't get it. Where did Lulu go wrong? Did she not campaign hard enough? Did she not raise enough money? Did she hold too few debates against a cardboard Nancy Pelosi?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've got to tell you this scares me to my core. I'm shaking. This was the first political campaign where I knew and cared about the candidate before they got into politics. I saw first-hand how her opponents smeared her with outrageous accusations I knew to be untrue. And that has made me wonder if other campaigns have done this as well. I mean, is it possible that John McCain actually doesn't have an illegitimate black child? And does that mean Megan McCain is white? I don't know what to believe anymore. And could it be that I have lied about candidates I disagree with, like that time I said that Harry Reid is just a leather saddle bag brought to life by a Navajo shaman? I mean it feels true, but maybe it's not. I don't know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After all, partisanship has made it almost impossible for anything to get done in Washington. Congress can't raise the debt ceiling. They can't pass a budget. And the House spent all last week debating whether they are deadlocked or gridlocked until they finally reached a stalemate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, some people out there blame this on rifts within the Republican Party. For instance, the GOP-controlled House took two days to pass legislation that extended the government's helium reserves, which Democrats would have allowed them to pass by unanimous voice vote. But you can't pass a helium bill by voice vote. It would be embarrassing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, folks, of course other people say it's Obama's fault, like 'New York Times' columnist Maureen Dowd, who recently wrote, 'The job of the former community organizer and self-styled uniter is to somehow get Congress to do the stuff he wants them to do. It's called leadership.' Yes, the definition of leadership is getting people who despise you to work with you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A recent Gallup poll on gun control found that 73% of Republicans would vote to expand background checks, but a second Gallup poll found that 50% of Republicans approved the Senate not passing background checks. That means 23% of Republicans are happy that the Senate voted against the background checks that those same 23% would have voted for. Well, I certainly hope they wrote their senators a nice thank you threat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the President goes left, we go right. He zigs, we refuse to raise the debt limit and destroy the global economy. But don't get smug, Democrats, because in 2009, 72% of Democrats supported Obama's plan to close Guantanamo within a year. But after Obama backed off, only 32% of Democrats wanted to close it. That's what I call a flip-flop. Unless the President calls it that, in which case I call it integrity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;South Carolina had a congressional election yesterday, and - you remember Governor Mark Sanford of South Carolina? He got himself into some trouble, and he had to go away. Well, he's back, and he won the congressional seat?yesterday, and it's crazy because there's nothing like a guy who stands up for traditional values while he's&quot; having an affair with &quot;an Argentine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But this guy, Mark Sanford, smart guy. Got his scandal out of the way before he went to Washington.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New Secretary of State John Kerry went over to see Vladimir Putin over there in Russia - the evil Vladimir Putin and John Kerry, Secretary of State.&quot; (Noting that Putin kept Kerry waiting) &quot;Yes, three hours. He had a good excuse. Putin was on the phone with Dennis Rodman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what I'm talking about with Dennis Rodman? He's buddied up now with Kim Jong Un, the vicious, evil dictator of North Korea. ... And Dennis Rodman visited Kim Jong Un a couple months ago and apparently they're really, really close friends now. And earlier in the week, Dennis Rodman sent a message, like a Twitter message or a tweet-text message or something, to Kim Jong Un, and the message read, 'Kim Jong Un, do me a solid and release an American prisoner.' ... Who does this guy think he is, Charlie Sheen?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big news here in the tri-state area, Chris Christie, who was on our show - seems like a great guy to me, really working day and night helping New Jersey recover [from] Hurricane Sandy - wonderful man, but he weighed about 600 pounds. And so, finally he said to his family, he said, 'You know what? You deserve better than this, so for 2012, I'm really, really going to lose some weight.' 2012, by the way, was his cholesterol. ... So here's what he does...the very next day he goes to a place, secretly has a...procedure done on his stomach so he won't eat food anymore, and now he's telling everybody? It was a secret, but he's lost 40 pounds. Really? ... If you've lost 40 pounds and it's still a secret, then you must really have been pretty damn heavy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bill Clinton was being interviewed recently. He said that, despite all the speculation, Hillary hasn't said anything to him about running for president in 2016. Though, in fairness, she hasn't said anything to him since 1998.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a stunning comeback, former South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford, remember him? He's the guy who told his wife he was going for a hike, then went to Argentina to see his girlfriend. He was then exposed as an unethical, lying, cheating weasel. He has been elected to Congress, where he'll fit right in.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Colorado is going to become the first state to regulate and tax recreational marijuana. They're starting at a 15% excise tax and a 10% sales - that's 25%. You know, it's bad enough the cost of living is high. Now, the cost of getting high is high. Well, actually, some people are concerned that if they tax it that high, people will go to drug dealers instead. They'll buy it from drug dealers instead, because it's cheaper. Which is depressing, isn't it? I mean, your government is greedier than the drug cartels?&quot;</SPAN></P>

But acts of terror, terrorist attack, is that really the scandal here? No. That's just semantics. This is also about the words people used. Let me set the stage, folks. This attack [Benghazi] came two months before the election. And Obama could not have an Al Qaeda attack on his watch when he's the one who personally strangled Bin Laden with one of his shoe laces - I believe that's what he claims.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, this is a new low for the IRS. What's next? Making GE pay taxes? Folks, there is only one way to describe a scandal this hot. ? It's chilling. Which also describes the champagne I've been waiting to break out for just this scandal. Folks, this proves that everything I've ever said about Obama is true. So it's official. He's a secret Muslim, shape-shifting alien from Kenya who is coming for our guns, and Bo is a member of the Illuminati.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love what IRS commissioner Steve Miller said today about this whole targeting conservative groups thing.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am telling you, folks, the donkey crowd just doesn't get it. Every Obamacare repeal is unique, because Republicans never play this issue the same way twice.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And folks, the only thing I don't like is when the GOP gets all self-indulgent and tries to play their new stuff like immigration reform, which has begun its climb through Congress in a disturbing reminder that Hispanics can vote. And make no mistake, folks, the only reason the Republicans are doing this is because of the 2012 election. I don't know if you remember that one. Sadly, I do, despite drinking a smoothie of my entire medicine cabinet. You think a cocktail of Rolaids, Listerine and Gold Bond Powder would erase something.&quot;</SPAN></P>

He's currently being questioned on the Benghazi attack, the IRS targeting conservative groups, and the Department of Justice seizing phone records from reporters of the Associated Press. A lot of people are saying that Obama could go down as our worst black president in more than 100 years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a matter of like six weeks, three big scandals, and it looks like President Obama and all his buddies in the White House may go to prison. ... Finally, some good news for the Romney campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People always say this to me, they say, 'Hey, Letterman,' they say. 'Why don't you make jokes about Obama?' All right, I'll tell you why. ... I don't make jokes about him, because I don't want the FBI tapping my phone. That's why.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the three scandals, we have the IRS investigating people they don't like. Well, you know, you kind of gotta give them that, right? Then you have the FBI tapping phones. And then Benghazi. And they see?Benghazi as a powder keg; and this scandal, they believe, may go as high as Dennis Rodman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you have scandals like that, it really gets in the way of not getting things done. ... If they don't fix these crises pretty soon, honest to God, it could bring gridlock to a screeching halt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Okay, Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson voted no on gun reform legislation, in spite of the fact 81% of voters in his state wanted background checks. Ron Johnson said, no dice. Senator Johnson, he has received $1.2 million in contributions from pro-gun lobby groups. And as you can see (referring to a Rob Jonson photo) he spent most of that money on flag pins and hairspray.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If these measures from the IRS and Justice were taken at the behest of the White House, that is Nixonian. At best, if you believe the Administration only found out about this stuff through news reports, it's still bad. It's just that the President's inner Magoo is being revealed. It's Magoovian.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All of these scandals could add up to very bad repercussions for the Obama Administration. And many?Republicans are entitled to their moment of righteousness, but guess what? History didn't start Friday. And Obama Administration transgressions don't wipe away yours, which are many and grievous. So, enjoy watching your friends have their fun, but twiddle-Dick (Dick Cheney) and twiddle-Rum (Donald Rumsfeld) don't get to join the party. It's like this. ... That's Mike Tyson. He doesn't get to make fun of someone's tattoo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Man, President Obama is not having a good week. With three scandals shaking the White House, they're saying that this is one of the worst weeks of Obama's presidency. Obama's like, 'How could things get worse?' And Joe Biden was like, 'You rang?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last week, Obama gave a commencement speech at Ohio State University. And on Monday, Joe Biden spoke at the University of Pennsylvania. And not surprisingly, their speeches were pretty different. Here, I'll show you what I mean. During his speech, Obama said, 'We've seen courage and compassion, a sense of civic duty and a recognition that we are not a collection of strangers.' And in Biden's speech, he said, 'You should never take candy from a stranger, unless it's Milk Duds. Those things are the bomb-diggity.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's another one. Obama said, 'While things are still hard for a lot of people, we have every reason to believe that your future is bright.' Biden said, 'My favorite thing about the future is Dippin' Dots.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last one, here. Obama said, 'Incredible advances in information and technology have the potential to change the way we do almost everything.' Biden said, 'I heard about these scientists in Norway who are working on giving squirrels tiny cell phones to help them keep in touch, or I might have dreamt that. Either way, cool, right?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You probably heard about this. The national aquarium in Washington, DC, is going to close. But don't worry. If you're in DC and you still want to smell something fishy, stop by the White House. There's something going on there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, do you know this week marks the 40th anniversary of the Watergate hearings? Now, for those of you too young to remember, back then, the Administration had an enemies list. They were spying on reporters. They used the IRS to harass groups they didn't like. Thank God those days are gone forever.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been a rough week for Obama. A lot of critics are comparing President Obama to President Richard Nixon, which is unfair. Nixon's unemployment rate was only five percent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this has become a huge story. You know this whole IRS thing? Apparently targeting conservative groups like the tea party? You know it's bad when President Obama says, 'Hey, why don't we talk about Benghazi? Anybody have questions about Benghazi?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This Benghazi thing ? that's not gonna go away anytime soon either. The White House has gone from 'change you can believe in' to 'changing the story until you believe it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Joe Biden speaking out in 'Rolling Stone' magazine. Finally, that guy is talking. He's so quiet. It's about time we heard what he has on his mind. In a new interview that just came out, Joe Biden says he spends four or five hours every day with President Obama. Yeah. In response, Obama said, Hiring that Obama impersonator was the best decision I've ever made.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tough news for the Democratic Party. I don't know if you've heard about this, but since President Obama took office, the Democratic Party has lost nine governorships, 56 members of Congress and two Senate seats. Now, in his defense, Obama said, 'I did promise change.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This afternoon, President Obama held a joint press conference with the Prime Minister of Turkey. Why Turkey, I'm not sure. I think those are the only sandwiches his wife lets him eat. The press didn't really care about the Prime Minister of Turkey. Reporters were focused on the numerous firestorms surrounding the White House right now. They drilled the President on Benghazi, the IRS, the subpoenaed phone records. They want to know why Randy Jackson is leaving 'American Idol.' And I think the stress is starting to get to Obama. At one point, he started screaming, 'I did not have sexual relations with Benghazi.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, while President Obama is dealing with all of those controversies, this is what Vice President Biden is up to. A seven-year-old boy from Milwaukee, a kid by the name of Myles Nelson, wrote a letter to the Vice President. He has an interesting solution to our problem about gun violence. Miles wrote, 'Dear Vice President Biden, I have a great idea to make our country safer, better and the best. I think guns should shoot out chocolate bullets, so no one will get killed and no one will be sad. Sincerely, Miles.' On one hand, it's great this seven-year-old is concerned enough about gun safety he would write a letter to the Vice President. On the other hand, he's clearly stoned when he came up with this idea, right? And that's disturbing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Believe it or not, the Vice President wrote Myles back. He said, 'Dear Myles, I'm sorry it took me so long to respond to your letter. I really like your idea. If we had guns that shot chocolate, not only would our country be safer, it would be happier. Happy people love chocolate. You are a good boy. Joe Biden.' You are a good boy? Do you think he thinks he was writing a letter to a dog? The saddest part is that is the first letter Biden received since he took office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Listen, kid ? if you really want a politician to get behind guns with chocolate bullets, the guy you should be writing to is Governor Christie. He will get this done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was outside for a little bit. It seemed hot. I was sweating like President Obama at a press conference.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the President, I'm telling you, a lot of trouble,&quot; with &quot;three different scandals going on. Today, the White House released 99 pages of emails on trouble in Benghazi?and one shirtless tweet from Anthony Weiner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;?Senator Rob Portman. He voted no on gun reform legislation despite the fact that 83% of the voters in his state, let me repeat that, 83%...of the voters in his state wanted background checks for gun buyers. ... Rob Portman took a look at the data and said, 'No dice'. ... He's our 'Stooge of the Night.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Finally. the IRS are in trouble! ...They have a new boss after it came out they unfairly targeted tea party groups. ... The President says the new IRS chief is not only good with numbers, but he has more integrity than the last guy. That's right, it's Bernie Madoff.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, I hope you know, for Obama watchdogs like me, the last week of scandals has been like Christmas morning. ... Now, of course, Obama has been in full damage control trying to wiggle out of this one, just like he wiggled out of serving in Vietnam. Sorry, Mr. President, you can't escape this time by claiming to be eight years old.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, despite the Senate's recent defeat of universal background checks, the gun control debate rages on. Will America be a place where anyone, anywhere, can get a gun regardless of mental health or criminal record, or will we face the nightmare of not that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyone with an inexpensive desktop 3-D printer can load a file and print the parts of a working firearm in a few hours, making it the fastest way to get a gun in America, next to opening a checking account in Texas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This kind of gun is so accessible to so many people so quickly, Defense Distributed is even calling it a 'wiki-weapon,' because like Wikipedia, it will also be used to settle bar bets. Well, sad to say, no surprise, Uncle Sam goose-stepped in last week and boot-stomped our online freedoms, ordering Defense Distributed to remove the file that provides instructions for the 3-D printed gun until it examines them for legality. Folks, this is chilling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;?it seems like only yesterday that Barack Hussein?Obama began his second term as president with high hopes. But now, just four months later, he finds himself mired in an inescapable downward slog, where the only congressional action he can count on is punitive in nature. He has entered into a three-and-a-half year race of [bleep]. His only hope: the media?with the attention span of a concussed goldfish.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's talk that Hillary Clinton's ties to President Obama could cost her the 2016 election, especially after the scandal she faced this week. While Hillary's saying, 'Eh, not the worst White House scandal I've been through.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this week will mark the 37th time House Republicans have tried to repeal Obamacare. You know, if Republicans really want to do away with Obamacare, they should endorse it as a conservative non-profit. Let the IRS take it down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well?a lot of critics are now comparing President Obama to President Nixon. The good news for Obama? At least he's no longer being compared to President Carter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess this has not been a good week for President Obama. Got Benghazi, the IRS scandal, this AP records scandal, and, worst of all, his Chicago Bulls got eliminated by the Miami Heat. ... You know what that means? LeBron James is going to get audited by the IRS.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know, love him-hate him, you got to admit President Obama is a new kind of Democrat. I mean, think about it - he's embroiled in three scandals, not one of them involves sex. That has never happened before.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been a tough week for President Obama. In fact, this morning he called Mitt Romney and said, 'Look, do you still want the job?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Man, President Obama in a lot of hot water lately. ... But he's still hanging in there despite everything. ...

'Today's jobs report is a reminder we can't afford self-inflicted wounds on the economy. Time to end the sequester with a balanced approach.' That's honest. Take a look at this next one.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[On White House officials' knowledge of the IRS scandal] &quot;I know the cardinal rule is you don't get involved, but the problem here is the gap between involved in and aware of. It's like your kids want to make dinner for you. You don't have to be involved, but you should be aware that they're doing it. Or you get stuck explaining why your house burned down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sorry. It's becoming very clear that nobody really knows enough about these three scandal/issues to make any definitive judgment on them yet. But if it's a scandal you want, it's the scandal we have. In our recurring series about returning Iraq and Afghanistan veterans and the paperwork quagmire that await them, the Obama Administration made a promise in April of 2009 that they would create a seamless, computerized veterans health record system. Costs be damned! Critics said it couldn't be done. Four years and $1 billion later, it turns out, yeah, they were right, it couldn't be done. At least not by the Administration. In fact, it so couldn't be done there's still a backlog of claims for 900,000 veterans and paper disability records still undigitized and piled up so high the floor of one VA field office [that it] is going to collapse. Perhaps injuring people, who luckily, would at least have instant access to the proper forms they would need to file the crushed-pelvis claims and most likely have the time to fill them out because of how long it will take to dig them out of the rubble.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you watch the news like I do, it seems like lately President Obama cannot swing a dead cat without hitting some sort of scandal. Which reminds me, what's he doing with all these dead cats? The challenge is, folks, which one to cover. So tonight, I am proud to introduce for the first time on the 'Colbert Report' the Obama Scandal Booth. ? Now, inside this booth are slips of paper, each with the name of a White House scandal: IRS, AP, Benghazi, immortal scorpion soldiers. Oh, it's coming out. And just moments from now, ladies and gentlemen, I will enter the booth and, like my colleagues, grasp wildly at any accusation that floats past.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes, Obama dumped acting IRS Commissioner Steve Miller, and I say it's about time. My sources tell me he's a joker, a smoker and a midnight toker. And often uses the alias Maurice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, the tax-exempt groups singled out by the IRS are all social welfare organizations known as 501 (c) (4)s. Warning: The c-4 designation grew in value in 2010; right after the Supreme Court said corporations could spend unlimited cash on elections, c-4 applications more than doubled. C-4s are specifically forbidden to make politics their primary activity, but one advantage: they don't have to reveal their donors. A c-4 is like a super PAC that doesn't have to reveal its donors, which means they could be anyone from one of the Koch brothers all the way to the other Koch brother. And it is all perfectly legal, as long as politics isn't the group's primary activity - meaning your 501 (c) (4) can spend 49% of its efforts producing ads calling Barack Obama a socialist as long as it spends the other 51% doing something good for the community, like educating our children that Barack Obama is a socialist.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House has admitted that President Obama's Chief of Staff had advanced warning the IRS was targeting conservative groups, but never told the President. Well, President Obama says the first time he heard about the IRS scandal and the AP phone records scandal...was from the media. See, that's why President Obama holds press conferences.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These scandals at the White House just keep getting worse. It turns out now that President Obama's chief of staff knew about the scandal at the IRS three weeks before the President found out. Obama was like, 'Anything else you guys aren't telling me?' And Biden was like, 'Uh, I broke the copier.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, President Obama's team knew about the IRS scandal, but kept him in the dark about it, or as Obama put it, 'Guys, when I said no spoilers, I was just talking about 'Game of Thrones.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republican Congressman Jeff Duncan of South Carolina proposed a bill to forbid the US Census Bureau from conducting any survey except for a population count. Hear that, Census Bureau? Population count only. You have no right to my personal information. That belongs to Facebook! Jeff Duncan knows this is really a private privacy issue, explaining now the Census Bureau can ask citizens very invasive questions. ? Every few years they show up on our front porch asking for personal information. It's like a drunk ex-boyfriend. 'Suzanne, who's the new guy you're dating? What's the highest level of education he's completed, or is he Pacific Islander or other?' Folks, the government says census information is necessary for distributing government services, but the real plans for this information are anybody's guess. Or everybody's guess. Because according to reports published in the highly prestigious 'The Internet,' census data could very well be used to make a database of gun owners for confiscation, or direct UN troops where to kick in your door, or for something even more sinister, like tracking the corn harvest. Terrifying. It's like that horror movie 'Aggregate Yield of the Children of the Corn.' Besides, we don't need to count corn. I'm pretty sure at this point Monsanto has genetically engineered corn so much it can count itself.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'&quot;Time' magazine published President Obama's prom photos. [Showing photo] There he is with a friend and their dates. I've got to say, the girls in Kenya are very good looking. Obama is 17 years old here. Notice he's the only one not holding champagne. That's called plausible deniability. The girl on the right side of the screen is his date. Her name is Megan Hughes. The other two are his friends, Kelly and Greg. He seems so happy back then. Like he was allowed to eat junk food or something.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kelly is the one who gave the photos to 'Time.' She also gave them a copy of what the President wrote in her high school yearbook. This is it. It says, 'Kelly, it's been so nice to get to know you this year. You're very nice and foxy. I don't know why Greg would want to spend any time with me at all. You really deserve better than clowns like us. You always laugh at my jokes. I hope we can keep in touch this summer even though Greg will be gone. Call me up and I'll buy you lunch sometime. ... Good luck in everything you do and stay happy. Your friend, Barry Obama.' Wow, Barry was on the prowl, wasn't he? And he wants Greg's woman. Look at that smile.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, I've got a confession to make. I'm no fan of Barack Obama. There, I said it. Somebody had to. But I am a fan of how he's handled the war on terror by following the exact same policies laid out by President Bush, who followed the exact same policies laid out by President Cheney, particularly his flying deathbot program, which some have criticized because it's been used to kill Americans overseas. But it's very limited in its scope, in that only an informed, high-level government official can order your death. That means the President or the Secretary of State - definitely no lower than the Postmaster General, which I assume means no more killing on Saturdays.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it's all perfectly legal thanks to a 2001 congressional resolution called 'The Authorization for Use of Military Force' or AUMF. So-called, because it is what gives Obama's unchecked killing authority that special oomph.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Right here?this is the actual resolution, a svelte 60 words of eternal war-justifying deliciousness. Here we go. 'Be it resolved that the President is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred September 11, 2001 or harbored such organizations or persons in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations, or persons.' Folks, this is the most beautifully sweeping, knee-jerk declaration of vengeful fury since FDR said after Pearl Harbor, 'This is a date that will live in infamy. Hey, Tojo, I don't need to stand up to put my boot up your a**.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, folks, this unlimited power to wage war wherever is the result of a careful, deliberative process, because after the September 11 attacks, Congress took an entire seven days to pass it. That's longer than it took God to make heaven and Earth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Referring to Obama's Thursday counterterrorism speech) &quot;The President wants to repeal the source of his power. That's like Ryan Gosling repealing his abs. Or Matthew McConaughey repealing his abs, or me repealing my power to name people with abs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Referring to a Congressmember's comments on Obama's counterterrorism speech) &quot;Oh, great! Let's put Congress in charge of the war on terror. 'Hey, we have Al Qaeda number one in our sights? Do we hit him with a drone?' Three months of subcommittee hearings later, he's still on the loose, but Congress has named the Ayman al-Zawahiri post office. Come on!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If anything, I say the AUMF is too restrictive, because the resolution says you've got to link the terrorists you're killing to 9/11. So far, that has not been a problem, thanks to a high-level CIA technique known as 'Six Degrees of Guys Who Don't Eat Bacon.' For instance, here is how we justified?drone strikes in Yemen: Yemen, lemon, lemon lime, seven and seven, 7/11, 9/11. Perfectly legal.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Time' magazine just released a picture of 17-year-old President Obama with his prom date. Did you see this? They would've published a picture of Joe Biden with his prom date, but his mom didn't want to be photographed.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the latest scandal in Washington, of course, is raising questions on the IRS. You know, I have a question. Why is it called the Internal Revenue Service? How is having your money confiscated a service?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Time' magazine found a picture of President Obama at his high school prom, back in 1979. Show the picture. I love this picture. ... The theme of the prom was 'Hope and change out of that dress into something more comfortable,' I believe. See, that was back in 1979. Let me tell you how long ago that was.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This latest California wildfire is getting pretty scary. ... But Governor Jerry Brown, God bless him, he's got it under control. He said what he's going to do he's going to tax and regulate the fire until it gets fed up and moves to another state.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama says he's renewing his efforts to close Guantanamo Bay. Guantanamo Bay? How about closing the IRS? ... In fact, how about shipping the IRS to Guantanamo Bay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, more problems with the IRS. A new report has found that they spent $50 million on employee conferences and retreats in just two years. They would have investigated sooner, but it turns out, you know, they don't belong to any conservative groups, so nobody really knows.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Two members of Congress have sent letters to the owner of the Washington Redskins asking them to change the name of the team because it's offensive. You really want to make it less offensive? Take out the word 'Washington.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know actor Steven Seagal? He is now in Russia, meeting with Vladimir Putin. Is this what American foreign policy has come down to now? Dennis Rodman's in North Korea, Steven Seagal is in Russia. What is next? Are we air-dropping Gary Busey into Syria? Maybe Snooki goes to Iraq?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Democratic Party suffered a real setback this past week when one of their leading vote-getters decided to call it quits. But enough about Michele Bachmann.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You've probably heard Michele Bachmann has decided not to run for re-election in 2014. Well, with Sarah Palin and Michele Bachmann both gone, Republican leaders have no idea who's gonna drive their party off a cliff in the next election. This is going to be a big problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, let's see, we got scandals going on and the IRS - now, the IRS apparently spent a lot of our tax dollars on lavish vacations and parties. Bunch of accountants going crazy. I don't have a problem with that. That's fine with me. There's a little box on your return there. You check the box if you want to spend a dollar so idiots can go dancing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week President Obama is going to be engaged in high-level talks with the president of China. ... Yes, President Obama's message to China is going to be, 'I swear we'll have the money for you by Tuesday.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's being rumored that Scarlett Johansson is going to play a young Hillary Clinton in a movie about Hillary Clinton's life. ... And as a result, the part of the young Bill Clinton will be played by Bill Clinton. He volunteered.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new report says that Donald Trump has spent $1 million trying to figure out if he should run for president in 2016. ... Experts are already calling it the most expensive 'no.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new study just came out. Found that KFC sells 25 pieces of fried chicken a second. ... It was 50 pieces a second, but then Chris Christie had his stomach stapled.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During his trip to Brazil on Friday, Joe Biden said that he was having such a good time that he didn't want to go home. And that was just while he was riding on the baggage carousel at the airport.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many Republicans want President Obama to fire Attorney General Eric Holder after he seemed to contradict himself under oath. When asked if he was worried, Holder said, 'Yes. I mean, no.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One beleaguered government bureau, the IRS, spent the week further mired in a scandal that stems from accusations that its agents particularly targeted right-wing groups for scrutiny. Oh, no! Poor babies. The IRS facing scrutiny. People getting all up in their business, checking their books just because one small area of their business raised a couple of red flags. Now, everybody at the IRS has to stop their lives and prove their innocence. Excellent. Or perhaps we can put that in terms the IRS might understand themselves. It's our new segment, 'Where's Your Receipts, [bleep]hole?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sucks to get audited, doesn't it? Suddenly, actions that seem harmless can be painted in a nefarious light. Well, why don't we get started? ? Having the President to tell you to use the power of the IRS to destroy his political enemies on the right should really only take about one meeting, two tops. The first meeting will be like, 'Hey, why don't you target my political enemies?' Then, the next 156 you're like, 'Did you take care of that thing?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Can't a government agency sit around the table picking names of seniors out of a hat to see who needs to die so that it can save enough money to give elementary school children their birth control, without everyone getting all 'What's going on in there?' Yeah, welcome to Audit World, IRS. By the way, Kevin Costner's second worst movie. It is a time on earth. Man lives in a city of forms. It's a world drowning in paperwork. See, that's the problem with auditing IRS. You may have perfectly reasonable explanations for every action that you took. That doesn't mean we don't need you to go back home and dig through another couple of shoe boxes until we get one document that we really need to see before we can be okay.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, more problems for the IRS. Good. Isn't that just the feel-good story of the year? It seems the agency wasted $50 million over a two-year period on conferences and retreats for employees. It was revealed today, they even spent $11,000 on a happiness expert. You know, I got an idea how to make them happier. How about stopping making everybody else's life miserable?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems an IRS executive named Lois Lerner - you probably saw her testifying - has refused to quit, and she will collect her full pay and benefits while she is on administrative leave. The IRS asked her to resign. She has refused to go. See, where in the real world does that ever happen? You get fired. And you tell your boss, 'I'm gonna stay, and I want my money.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, how about that IRS, huh? Now listen to this. The IRS - and we know what they do - they weasel you and they screw you and they take your money. And that's the price we pay for the great life we have here in the United States. We have to put up with the weasely IRS cheating and screwing us out of our hard-earned money. Guess what they have been doing with our tax dollars? They've been throwing themselves lavish parties. Well, on the other hand, what good is it being a bunch of power-hungry, jack-booted drones if you can't enjoy yourselves - if you can't every now and then pat yourself on the back?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So anyway, the IRS is working now on regaining trust - trust! Regaining trust! Nobody ever trusted the IRS! We don't care, they're weasels. Nobody trusted them. Regaining trust. Ha!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember Michele Bachmann? Who was from Minnesota, running for President? She has announced that she will not seek reelection. She says she wants to spend more time now listening to the voices in her head.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are reports that Al Qaeda actually has a complaints department. It's true. Seems crazy, but we were actually able to get our hands on some of those complaint cards. Here's the first one, here: 'The price limits for corporate dinners should be increased to three goats; I've got deals I need to close.' And this one, here: 'I'm declaring a jihad on the person who keeps stealing my lunch from the break room fridge.' And here's the last one: 'Not to be that guy, but whatever happened to guacamole Friday?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's get to some serious questions on the international scene. People asking if the United States should become involved in the war in Syria. Slow down, America. Remember, our troops are still in Afghanistan and we still haven't figured out for sure who won The Iraq War.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Iraq, you awarded all your oil contracts to China. Iraq, I mean come on, man. We launched a sustained shock-and-awe bombing campaign on your country. We reduced your already stressed infrastructure to rubble and unleashed sectarian conflict that even now costs your country hundreds of lives per month. And this is how you repay us?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;China thinks, 'Oh, we spent $2 billion, rebuilding Iraqi infrastructure.' Big [bleep] deal! When we were in Iraq, we spent $2 billion just looking for the other $9 billion we lost. Apparently, we shipped it to Iraq in a container that said ' $9 billion' and someone ran off with it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who Anthony Weiner is? ... He got in trouble because he was fooling around with his?cell phone thing and one thing led to another and before you know it he had taken pictures of his reproductive organs. Shot them across the country and everybody said, whoa, pull the lever on this! So, now he wants to be mayor, and because of what's happened in his past he has to be mindful of just about everything, really.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Five years, five years Congress has maintained a near flawless record of uselessness. But even with their top obstructionists, things were bound to fall through the cracks. An elementary school gets named. A bridge gets fixed up. Expanded healthcare coverage gets passed. But since that slip-up, the House has voted to repeal or defund Obamacare 37 times. Not because they're stubborn - they have no short-term memories. It's covered.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anthony Weiner?recently announced that he is running for mayor of New York City. And now he's looking for interns to work in his campaign. We actually got a hold of some of his interview questions, and it seems like he's mostly concerned about one thing. Take a look: 'Do you use Twitter? Do you know how to remove things from Twitter? Can you remove something right now, if I were to show you something I accidentally put on Twitter, from Twitter? Do you know how to make it so I can't take pictures on my phone? ... You answer those questions, you've got a job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, President Obama has called on Congress to pass a media shield law which would allow reporters to do their job without fear of government prosecution. Yeah, we have that. It's called the First Amendment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to CNN, former Senator John Edwards now planning to open a new law firm this fall. John Edwards going back to work as an attorney. I guess, he figured he's lying so much already he might as well start getting paid for it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A huge honor, a huge honor - this Friday the President of China will be right here in California. He says the purpose of his visit is to strengthen Chinese ties with the Mexican people. So, that's exciting.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big story in Washington today, an English newspaper called 'The Guardian' is reporting that the National Security Agency...here in the United States obtained a secret court order that forces Verizon to hand over phone records for millions of their customers who made calls between the months of April and July. They know who called and when, if you're a Verizon customer, which I was totally against this, until I got an anonymous call reminding me it was my dad's birthday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the Obama Administration has not confirmed the court order does exist. But a senior official said that it would only be used to collect data that could protect America from terrorism. And so Michelle Obama can keep tabs on how many times we call Pizza Hut. So, in case you're wondering, the answer is, yes, they can hear you now. Kind of scary, right? Don't think of it as the NSA spying on you. Try to think of them as part of your family plan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll tell you something, and I've never said this before about a politician, especially a mayor of New York City. I think the guy running this city, Mayor Bloomberg, I think this guy is a genius. He has turned this town into a wonderland. You know what I'm talking about? You know the potholes all over New York City? Some of them are enormous. There's one on 8th Avenue that actually has a gift shop at the bottom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big heads of state meeting tomorrow in California. Chinese President Xi Jinping?meeting with President Obama tomorrow. And then Saturday he meets with Dennis Rodman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Referring to the Verizon phone records news) &quot;It has been a tough week for Obama. This comes on the heels of the IRS scandal. Before that was Benghazi. Even the crack-head mayor of Toronto's like, 'Rough week, eh?' ? Next we'll find out Obama was somehow behind last week's 'Game of Thrones' wedding.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The reality is that the Republicans and Democrats in Congress have both come out in defense of collecting this data. And as every good American knows, when Democrats and Republicans agree on something in Congress it is time to be very, very worried, indeed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congress actually gave the White House authority to spy on phones under President Bush. But experts say cell phone snooping actually goes as far back as the Clinton Administration. But it wasn't organized back then. It was just Bill Clinton calling up women, 'What are you wearing.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes, the National Security Agency is spying on our phone calls, and unlike during the Bush Administration, this time it's the Obama Administration. ... This guy, he is always trying to outdo his predecessor. 'Oh, he poured water on their face? I'm going to blow 'em up. Did I win?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, according to the UK's 'Guardian,' the newspaper, Verizon's business services division was ordered by the FBI to deliver millions of customers' 'telephony metadata.' Now, that's a lot of jargon, so let me break it down for you. Metadata means information about a call's length, location, and participants. Telephony is what a two-year-old calls a telephone. And believe me, Obama knows all about the calls between Betsy and Puppy Wuppy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, folks, I'm going to be straight with you. I'm conflicted here, folks. On the one hand, this proves Obama is a tyrannical despot who ignores all the rules. On the other hand, I kind of like tyrannical despots who break all the rules. Shows spunk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Then again, I do think the Obama Administration has a point when they call this program 'a critical tool in protecting the nation from terrorist threats to the United States,' and not just because anyone who has dealt with Verizon's customer service wants to kill someone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Another scandal at the White House. It turns out there's a new?report out that the government has been secretly collecting the phone records of Verizon customers since April. ... I knew something was up when I was, like, 'You hang up first.' And then my wife is, like 'No, you hang up first.' And then Obama was like, 'How about you just hang up at the same time?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The National Security Agency has been collecting the phone records of Verizon since April, which explains Verizon's new ad campaign: 'They can hear you now.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new report shows the Obama Administration has been collecting the telephone records of millions of US customers of Verizon under a top-secret court order. Here's the sad part. Turns out 90% of phone calls Americans make are to order a pizza.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President of China is coming to the United States tomorrow. He is going to meet with President Obama. To make him feel at home, they are going to meet at a Wal-Mart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's come out that the government has been secretly collecting telephone records of millions of Verizon customers. Yeah, or as Verizon is calling it, 'The friends and family and Obama plan.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republican Florida Senator Marco Rubio will vote against his own immigration bill. In fact, he's now gone so far to the right, he's introducing a bill to deport himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Due to recent sexual misconduct in the military, Senator John McCain is suggesting women avoid serving altogether. Yeah, McCain added, 'And if they really want to play it safe, they might also want to stop working and voting. Just a suggestion.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, Snoop is back in the news. Not Snoop Dogg, Snoop Obama. Yeah, Snoop Obama. A big change at the White House, today. They closed the gift shop and opened a Verizon store.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this has become a huge controversy, after it was revealed that the National Security Agency seized millions of Verizon phone records. And of course this has caused a panic among the civil libertarians, constitutional scholars and cheating husbands everywhere. How ironic is that? We wanted a President that listens to all Americans. Now we have one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, President Obama clarified the situation today. He said no one is listening to your phone calls. The President said it's not what the program is all about. You know, like the IRS is not about targeting certain political groups. That's not what it's about!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I mean what's going on? The White House is listening to our phone records, checking our computers, monitoring our emails. When did the government suddenly become our psycho ex-girlfriend?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I'll tell you - if Obama wants to put this snooping thing to good use, how about spying on the IRS next time they throw a $4 million party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're saying the IRS paid an artist $17,000 to paint portraits of Abraham Lincoln to help inspire the IRS agents. You know, if they want to see a picture of Lincoln for inspiration, take out a $5 bill and save the taxpayers $16,995.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, the hearings have been unbelievable this week. Congressional investigators say the IRS basically threw a $4 million party for themselves. But in fairness, who else is going to throw a party for the IRS? ... Now, a going away party - I think we'd all chip in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know, in the wake of this whole IRS scandal, there's now talk of abolishing our 74,000-page tax code and replacing it with a flat tax. See, with a flat tax you could fit your entire return on a postcard and just mail it in. Unless you're Mitt Romney. Then you mail in a blank postcard that says 'Greetings from the Cayman Islands,' and you send that in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're predicting that the US debt could double in 15 years, unless Congress acts. Unless Congress acts. You know what that means? The US debt is going to double in 15 years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama was visiting a middle school yesterday, and while he was there, he said every school in the US should have high-speed Internet. And then it got awkward when one kid said, 'What, so you could read our emails faster?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know, we had Russell Crowe on the other night. He played Superman's father. And it's a great story. When Superman's dad realizes that his son is gifted with x-ray vision and super hearing, he puts him in a rocket and sends him towards earth. Because he knows, with those powers, he can get a job with the Obama Administration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, 'The Guardian' newspaper in England reported that a 29-year-old former technical assistant to the CIA named Edward Snowden leaked the story that the Federal government was collecting phone records from Verizon customers. Yeah. Snowden says you're being watched. To which NBC executives said, 'Finally.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama said no one is listening to your phone calls. He said no one in the government is listening to your phone calls. And you know, I believe the President. Have you ever called a government agency? The person on the other end is never listening!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, now a lot of people are asking how this Snowden guy could download all this classified information and give it to a British newspaper without the NSA knowing about it. I think I know the answer. If you don't want the NSA spying on you, get a job working at the NSA.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, a group of web developers say they have developed an app that protects cell-phone users from having their calls and texts tracked. In fact, reporters want to schedule an interview with these developers, but they were mysteriously killed in a drone strike.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama and the President of China met over the weekend in Palm Springs. It was a critically important meeting, because Obama is the leader of the most powerful country in the world, and the Chinese president holds the mortgage on it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, the story is the NSA has been listening in on telephone calls and spying on us. ? I want them to know everything about me. Today, I sent them a list of my sizes. Let's go. Here, take that! It's people with cell phones, and you hear these people, and maybe we have some in the audience, walking down the street screaming into their cell phone. You can hear them in all five boroughs. Those are the ones upset with people listening to their phone calls. Come on, really!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know your phone is being tapped when you're having a conversation and you hear the Attorney General breathing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the guy, the whistleblower, is all over TV. You see the guy? His name is Edward Snowden. He's very pleased with himself. Good for him. He says he doesn't want to live in a society where the society monitors its people. And then he fled to China.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's my problem. I sometimes feel desperately alone, and the idea that somebody is spying on me and keeping track of everything I do - makes me feel good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some political news, this weekend President Obama held talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping. It went well. Although it got awkward when Obama asked China to stop spying on America. And Jinping was like, 'You first.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sure you heard about this last week - it was revealed that the National Security Agency spied on Americans' phone records and Internet history for years. And yesterday, the source of the leak, former CIA employee Edward Snowden - sounds like a 'Game of Thrones' character - Edward Snowden came forward. He said that he's hiding out in Hong Kong. Marking the first time anyone has ever said, 'I don't want to be punished by the government so I'm going to China.' To China? To avoid government persecution? It's like going to Ireland to avoid getting drunk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Oliver [hosting &quot;The Daily Show&quot; for the summer]:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, it turns out the government is monitoring vastly more information than even George Orwell wet the bed over, which brings us to our new segment. 'Good News, You're Not Paranoid,' is brought to you by tin foil. Why not wear it as a hat?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Oliver:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thanks to a bespectacled whistleblower, we now know that the government has been actively collecting an unprecedented amount of information on a small select group of us who either make phone calls or use the Internet. I'm going to say I bet the Amish are feeling pretty [bleep] smug right now. Or they would be feeling that way, if they had any idea that this story was happening.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Oliver:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think you're misunderstanding the perceived problem here, Mr. President. No one is saying that you broke any laws. We're just saying it's a little bit weird that you didn't have to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Behold the face of evil. His name is Edward Snowden, and he's an employee of defense contractor Booz Allen Hamilton, named, of course, after our drunkest founding father. Now, Snowden has fled to a Hong Kong hotel room where the minibar has been stocked with 'Not Poison Brand-Actual Beer.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, I'll tell you, I might be the only one saying this, but I think I know what's really going on here. 'The Guardian' says that Snowden had a very comfortable life that included a salary of roughly $200,000 and a girlfriend with whom he shared a home in Hawaii. Nation, I think this could be the most passive-aggressive break-up in history. 'Honey, of course I'm into you. Yes, I want children. But first, I just have to leak a little information about the NSA and hide out in Asia for the rest of my life. This isn't about us. I'll be back as soon as I'm sure I won't be murdered by the Hong Kong triads.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if anyone else has noticed, but things are pretty messed up in the Middle East. Whether it's Syria, Iran, Libya Egypt, Iraq, or Syria again. Apparently, new violence broke out while I was listing those other countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems Tim Tebow has signed with the New England Patriots. ... Apparently, Tebow sat down and told Bill Belichick about his friend, Jesus. And Belichick told Tim about his friend, Satan, and they came to an agreement. ... Oh, nobody knew about this. This was a top secret deal. Nobody had any idea. The only people who knew were Bill Belichick, Tim Tebow and, of course, the NSA because they were, you know, listening in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, the good news - Tim Tebow got a job with the Patriots. The bad news - now that he's associated with the word 'Patriot,' he's being audited by the IRS.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody else have this problem? I've got Verizon, and I just found out I've gotten way more people on my friends and family plan than I thought I had. There's hundreds of people involved.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are really up in arms about this NSA spying thing. You know, if the government really wants to follow our every move, do what everybody else does. Stalk us on Facebook.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you understand the scope of this? They're monitoring 3 billion phone calls a day. Not to mention tweets, emails and texts. How do they do that? ... I can't keep up with my DVR, okay? ... I'm still on season two of 'Mad Men.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The guy who blew the whistle on this whole scandal is a former NSA security worker named Edward Snowden. In an interview, Snowden said he did what he did because 'I realized that I was part of something that was doing far more harm than good.' Why can't we get the Kardashians to realize this, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Snowden said he did this because he mistakenly believed in President Obama's promises. And now, the government wants to extradite him. The Justice Department wants to charge him. And Fox News wants to give him his own show.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, we're learning more and more about this guy. It seems Edward Snowden is a high school dropout. He was making $122,000 a year. He lived in Hawaii. He was engaged to a beautiful former ballerina. And he gave it all up. So, not only is he a whistle-blower, he's also a moron.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I always love when politicians say things like this. President Obama said today he welcomes a national debate over our surveillance policies. He said that's a debate we wouldn't have had five years ago. Five years ago? It's a debate we wouldn't have had two weeks ago, if they all hadn't gotten caught. That's why we're having the debate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well now, another potential scandal growing. It seems CBS News reporting may have uncovered documents that the State Department may have covered up that then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's security detail - not her - the guys in the security detail - may have engaged with prostitutes while on official business. Boy, it's bad time for President Obama, isn't it? I mean, even stories that involve a happy ending don't have a happy ending.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of the State Department, listen to this. And the United States ambassador to Belgium, a guy named Howard Gutman, has allegedly, now, been inviting call girls up to the embassy. Yup. I think I speak for everyone who's ever been to Belgium when I say, 'So what?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if you saw it last night, but let me just apologize. We had a bad show last night. I will tell you how bad the show was last night - halfway through, the White House stopped listening in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a poll, the majority of Americans are OK with the Obama Administration listening in on our phone calls. Guys approve, because they feel it increases security. And women approve of Obama's policy, because finally a man is listening to them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More information coming out about the whistleblower, the guy who started this scandal, Edward Snowden. His girlfriend apparently is a pole dancer. I guess that settles the debate about whether or not he's a hero.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;House Speaker John Boehner called Eric Snowden a traitor. But only because he leaked the name of his tanning bed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Marco Rubio announced a new bill that would require immigrants to learn English to become citizens. Many Americans already say it's the goodest news they have heard all year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is big. Hillary Clinton finally joined Twitter yesterday. She racked up more than 200,000 followers in only five hours. Yep. There were [tweets] like 'Hillary in 2016' and 'Washington needs Hillary.' 'Hillary for the White House.' That's not her followers, but those were her tweets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton sent her first tweet yesterday, or as one guy put it, [as Bill Clinton ] 'How do you block people on this thing?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I saw this week marks the 50th anniversary of the Equal Pay Act. Men were like, 'Can you believe it's been 50 years of equal pay?' And women were like, 'No.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Oliver:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight, we continue our coverage of the NSA scandal with our ongoing segment, 'Good News, You're Not Paranoid'. 'Good News, You're Not Paranoid' is brought to you by blankets. Cower under them for the illusion of safety. Blankets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Oliver:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So far, we've learned that the NSA program is technically legal, probably useful, and yet has the potential to do great harm. They're like bath salts. Good to relax in, less good to shove into your face.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Oliver:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But here's what really hurts about this story. It makes us pick between liberty and convenience. I love my privacy, but I also love to buy movie tickets on the toilet. Don't make me choose. Don't make me choose. It's too hard. I want both. I want both so bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Oliver:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Guns are one thing, but phone calls are too dangerous to go unchecked. Think about it. Really think about it. Some maniac could be calling about going on a shooting spree. You know what this means? You know what this actually means? At 11:09 p.m., on June 11, the Second Amendment has won the Bill of Rights. It has defeated all the other amendments. Which, of course, it did - when you think about it - it's the only amendment with a [bleep] gun. It actually seems pretty clear. If you don't want the government tracking your phone, there is only one solution. Gun phones. What could possibly go wrong?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The NSA surveillance program called PRISM, haven't heard of it? It's heard of you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, let's get straight to the story everyone's talking about. The NSA knows what everyone's talking about. And according to stunning new articles first published by friend of the show and professional blabbermouth Glenn Greenwald in the UK's 'The Guardian' the newspaper, the NSA is also engaging in cybersnooping. ? Now, this betrayal of our national security comes courtesy of former CIA technical assistance and nerd trying to look like a cool guy trying to look like a nerd Edward Snowden. Snowden leaked a top secret PowerPoint presentation that detailed how the government gathers massive amounts of information on everything but graphic design.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This secret program's name, PRISM, is an acronym for Planning Tool for Resource Integration Synchronization and Management. Incidentally, for revealing PRISM, Snowden may soon be in PRISON, for Probably Regretting Identifying Self on National TV.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who's popular now? George W. Bush. ... According to recent polls, George W. Bush is more popular than not popular. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Experts believe the reason George W. Bush is more popular now,,,is put up to a rare medical disorder known as 'forgetting.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is some sad news. Scarlett Johansson is denying reports that she'll play Hillary Clinton in an upcoming movie. ? Nobody is more disappointed than Bill Clinton. He was hoping to play himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Oliver:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But we begin tonight with the ever-growing list of scandals that has befallen this great nation.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Referring to the NSA leak story) &quot;This government spy scandal is huge. Due to the government spy scandal, sales of the classic George Orwell book '1984' have skyrocketed. So, the fallout is worse than we thought - it's making Americans read. That's frightening.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Immigration, also a big story. Senator Marco Rubio has proposed a measure requiring that all immigrants must know English. Opposing the bill are immigrant rights groups, civil rights advocates, and Arnold Schwarzenegger.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hispanic Senator Ted Cruz, who is fighting the immigration bill, described himself as Obamaphobic. You know you have Obamaphobia, if you'll deport immigrants even though your last name is Cruz.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know this guy Edward Snowden? Do you know anything about this guy? This guy shows up in a hotel in Hong Kong and he says, 'Send up a videotape crew.' Then he announces to the world that he's leaked confidential National Security Agency memos and documents. He's compromised the security of the free world, and now he's gone. He checks out of the hotel at Hong Kong. He's gone. Where is this guy? He could be a hero. ... Where is Edward Snowden? Gosh, if only there were a way to keep track of people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's the difference. When people's privacy is violated, it's illegal surveillance. I think we can all agree on that. When your privacy is violated, illegal surveillance. When people violate their own privacy, that's Facebook.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is kind of scary, you guys. There was this guy, a crazy guy. He was arrested for jumping over the White House fence and trying to spray paint a political message. ... If that guy really wanted to get a message to the President, he should have just written it in an email to literally anyone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now that the White House's surveillance program has been exposed, some of President Obama's celebrity supporters seem to be turning on him. ... Actually, one celebrity who isn't happy with the President, is actor John Cusack. ... He went on Twitter to criticize the President over recent scandals. Of course, it's going to be awkward when Obama tries to win him back and he's like: 'In your eyes, the light, the heat. Your eyes are complete?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's the big story. It continues to be this 29-year-old Edward Snowden guy. The man behind the leaking of the story of the NSA spy scandal. A lot of speculation about this guy. One of them now is, that Snowden is hiding in Hong Kong and could be working for China. Hey, let's get real, okay? Aren't we all pretty much working for China?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, they say Snowden also leaked the fact that the NSA has access to top Internet websites like Google, Microsoft and Facebook. So the lesson here: If you don't want the government watching you, go on Myspace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But, you know, some experts believe that this privacy scandal will hurt the NSA. Do you think it'll hurt it? What, are you crazy? You know how many people wanna join now? Especially when I heard a guy who blew the whistle was a high-school dropout, making almost $200,000 a year with a pole-dancer girlfriend, and he's living in Hawaii? People are lined up to get this job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to a Gallup poll out today, President Obama's approval rating has dropped to 45%. Only 45% of Americans now approve of the job he's doing. Luckily for Obama, he has impeachment insurance. It's called Joe Biden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Senate is getting closer and closer to passing a sweeping immigration bill. In fact, given how wide-sweeping this immigration bill is, if it passes, you'll press one for Spanish and two for English.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Edward Snowden, he's the 29-year-old guy behind this NSA spy scandal. He said in a new interview that he is not in hiding. Which would have carried a lot more weight if he hadn't made the announcement from an undisclosed secret location.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin said there should be a full investigation of both the San Antonio Spurs and the Miami Heat. And then, somebody told her, 'No, it's the NSA. Not the NBA.' So she got a little confused.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think this is a good idea. Instead of having the government looking into terrorists, why don't we hire the paparazzi? Think about this.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is traveling to Africa later this month, and people are upset&quot; because &quot;the trip is expected to cost taxpayers more than $60 million. ... Mostly for security, hotel accommodations - and Biden wants a giraffe.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is now in Ireland for the big G-8 Summit. You know, security for these overseas presidential trips are unbelievable. He has 14 limousines, trucks loaded with sheets of bulletproof glass to cover the hotel windows, and fighter jets flying in shifts. That's to protect the President. Joe Biden? He gets a pair of running shoes and a can of pepper spray.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big G-8 Summit taking place in Ireland. ? They spent the first 20 minutes of the conference admiring Vladimir Putin's Super Bowl ring. Did you hear about this? Years ago, the owner of the Super Bowl ring was at a party some place with Vladimir Putin...and Vladimir Putin says, 'Wow, that's some ring.' Putin takes look at it, puts it in his pocket, good-bye! ? So, now it turns out that the owner would like his Super Bowl ring back. He even offered to trade Tim Tebow for the ring.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Edward Snowden &quot;had a 98-minute press conference today and yet they can't find the guy. Dick Cheney said he believes Ed Snowden is working for the Chinese. Come on, Dick. Aren't we all working for the Chinese when you think about it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new poll found that the President's approval rating dropped eight points in the last month. Based on how he's done so far, we can actually see what Obama's future ratings will be and the reasons why they may go up or down. It's pretty incredible. Let's take a look. Next week, his approval ratings will go up three points. Let's see why. Obama makes it illegal for your friends to post photos of their babies on Facebook. That makes sense. In July, his ratings will drop five points. Let's see why. Obama hires Miss Utah as his speechwriter. ... And finally in August, his approval rating will rise 12 points. Let's see why. Obama appoints Ryan Gosling as Secretary of Handsome.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, well, well. Look what the Fox dragged in. Sarah Palin has been hired back by Fox News, and she only left five months ago. She's now effectively quit quitting. ? This is brings us to our new incredibly important segment. 'Wait a Second. We Can Just Ignore Her.' We can all do that. That is a power we have. Because, yes, we could spend the whole show juxtaposing video clips to demonstrate how Sarah Palin's strongly-felt convictions are nothing more than self-contradictory nonsense. Or, we can just ignore her. We can respond to her obvious trolling with a series of insulting jokes, and maybe together enjoy a brief moment of catharsis, or we can just [bleep] ignore her. I promise, America, it will feel so good. It will be like we give our brains an enema together. I'm not saying it will be easy. I mean, just look at her. She's a temptress. Oh, Sarah, if only it was as easy for us to quit you as it is for you to quit everything.&quot;</SPAN></P>

New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, apparently he was visiting in Russia, and he says that Russian President Putin stole his Super Bowl ring. He said Kraft was showing Putin the ring, Putin took it, put it in his pocket and walked off. And now, Putin says the ring was a gift. Really?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This story comes up about twice a year. They think they have located the body of Jimmy Hoffa. ... They thought he was buried at the old Giants stadium, and turns out he wasn't buried there. They got a tip. They think he's buried in a field in Michigan. Jimmy Hoffa after 40 years of being dead. Nothing on the NSA whistleblower, but we think we know where Jimmy Hoffa is. We're going to get right in there.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It turns out the Senate's new immigration bill that's been in the news, it's over 1,000 pages long. Some critics say the bill is too long for the average American to read before it's approved, while some Senators are saying that's the point.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone is still talking about this big government surveillance scandal. And in a recent interview, President Obama rejected comparisons between himself and Dick Cheney,&quot; but &quot;Obama admitted there's at least one similarity - both have experience being President.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Oliver:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight, Congress in a three-way tie for least popular branch of government. However, they may be about to accomplish - and I know it sounds improbable - something, specifically, immigration reform, which suddenly has support even from Republicans. [As Lindsey Graham] 'And I, Lindsey Graham, say to you the Hispanic community, we choose to help you not because we want to but because mathematically we feel we have to.' ? So, Democrats are on board, but Republicans may take a little more convincing. Sure, Dr. Graham may have a prescription for electoral success, but even though they know this is good for them they're going resist it - like a child with vegetables or a frat boy with a condom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Oliver:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Still, a lot of challenges ahead for this immigration bill to achieve its dream of legal status within the United States. Now, currently it's living in the land of bills, but it's yearning for a better life as a law. It paid its hard-earned political capital to a gang of not entirely reliable Toyotas to cross the legislative desert, only to navigate the perilous waters of debate hoping it can evade the dreaded filibuster patrol. But after all that, it's safe and there will be nothing stopping immigration reform from starting its brand new life in America. ? Oh, yeah. That's right. The House of Representatives. A thousand-foot high border fence built out of ignorance and spite.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former NSA analyst and current drone-bait Edward Snowden has gone missing, folks. That's right. This computer whiz has hit escape, control-alt-deleted himself and has avoided being caps-locked up, F-7. ? A global game of hide-and-seek. Why did we agree to count all the way to 100? And has anyone checked behind curtains in the living room? Now, folks, nobody knows exactly where Snowden might be. So far, there's just been a lot of irresponsible speculation, and I want in on it, which brings me to my now running segment 'Where in the World is Edward Snowdiego?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;White House spokesman Jay Carney said he's hoping the Russians would give back Edward Snowden. ... Good luck with that. We can't get Putin to give back that Super Bowl ring he stole.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, President Obama gave a big speech on climate change. He believes global warming is getting worse, because apparently he's sweating a lot more during his second term.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a radio interview, Pat Buchanan predicted that the inflow of Hispanics from the immigration bill will break the US into two countries with different cultures and different languages. Of course, as a resident of Los Angeles, I can't imagine what that would be like.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, everyone wants to know where he is. Now they're saying he's been living in the Moscow airport for two days. Not because he's a fugitive, but because he's flying United.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Oliver:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Okay, basically the key part of the Voting Rights Act they [SCOTUS] removed was the one that applied strict scrutiny to states with a previous history of racial discrimination, those states, of course, being White-sylvania, Pale-afornia, and Mississippi. We're good, we're good then. Because things have changed. We have got iPads, Twitter, everyone is allergic to bread now, and racially things have got better in the South. It's true, primarily because of things like, oh, I don't know, the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Do you remember that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Oliver:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, not only didn't it [the Farm Bill] cut enough spending, it also cut too much spending. It's like the bill was Goldilocks and the first bear says, 'I think your food stamp cuts are too low.' And the second bear says, 'I think your food stamp cuts are too high.' And instead of there being a moderate bear, the first two bears tear Goldilocks limb from limb and eat her. That's basically what happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, I've been paying pretty close attention to the Supreme Court, which just today overturned a key provision of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 which required the Jim Crow states to get Federal permission before changing any of their voting laws. Thankfully, Chief Justice John Roberts, Old Blue Eyes, knows that the South doesn't need to be babysat anymore, saying, quote, 'Nearly 50 years later, things have changed dramatically.' Yes, for some reason since the Voting Rights Act was passed, things have changed dramatically. Therefore, we can get rid of it now. It's just like those outdated labor laws that prohibit children from threading bobbins on a loom. A kid hasn't been sucked into one of those machines in years. Let's stop playing nanny here.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Supreme Court handed down the decision on same-sex marriage today. Until this morning, marriage was defined as a contract between one man, one woman and the producers of 'The Bachelor,' but that is no longer the case.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a five-to-four vote, the court struck down a major provision of the Defense of Marriage Act that denied benefits to married gay couples. So now, every adult American over the age of 18 must spend at least two years in a same-sex marriage. Go to GayDate.org to meet your potential mates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Supreme Court also considered Proposition 8, which banned same-sex marriage here in California. The court ruled that Prop. 8 supporters didn't have the right to repeal the reversal last year, which means next month, same-sex marriage will once again be legal in this state. The only catch is gays will be required to use straight wedding planners.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Elsewhere in Washington, there's another scandal brewing within the IRS. An internal watch group claimed some IRS workers used agency credit cards to buy a wide variety of seemingly inappropriate things. One IRS employee reportedly charged more than $2,500 worth of diet pills, romance novels and steaks to the IRS. I don't know who that person is, but sounds like they might have a sadder life than Bruce Jenner, even.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cards from the agency were also used to buy kazoos, bath toys, a popcorn machine, stuffed animals and Nerf footballs. Is the IRS running an underground Chucky Cheese and we don't know about it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know that Edward Snowden guy? He had a job in Hawaii and he was stealing secrets, and then he gave them to a guy and he published the secrets, and he said, 'I'm leaving Hawaii, I'll go to Hong Kong.' Gets tired of the food, and he says, 'You know what, I'm going to Moscow,' and nobody's heard from him since. We think he's still in Moscow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Supreme Court has ruled the Defense of Marriage Act is unconstitutional. And once someone explains this to me, I'm sure I'll be thrilled about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Next issue for the Supreme Court is defense of the Kardashian marriage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Defense of Marriage Act is dead. ... Traditional marriage is now as defenseless as a freshman frat pledge about to go through the spanking machine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, I for one cannot believe the court threw out DOMA. It was passed in 1996 to guarantee that traditional marriage was between one man and one woman for the sacred purpose of getting Bill Clinton re-elected. Listen, folks, to their so-called judicial reasoning: 'DOMA is unconstitutional as a deprivation of liberty of persons that is protected under the Fifth Amendment.' Oh, please. I find it hard to believe that there are amendments after the Second. Sounds made up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, folks, you know what this means? If DOMA is unconstitutional, that means the Constitution is gay. Of course, I mean, no real shocker. It was written by a bunch of dudes in wigs and tights in the City of Brotherly Love.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The thing about striking down DOMA is it doesn't affect any state's right to ban or to allow same-sex marriage. ... Here's how it works. You're married in New York. You're not married in Alabama. What gives? I'm as confused as a freshman frat pledge who really enjoyed that spanking machine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Referring to the Supreme Court's Voting Rights Act decision) &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, as a son of the South, from one of the states covered by the preclearance provision of the Voting Rights Act, I want to thank the Supreme Court for finally setting my people free.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, folks, in his decision gutting the Voting Rights Act, Chief Justice Roberts sagely noted something many of us had apparently missed about discrimination, saying, quote, 'nearly 50 years later things have changed dramatically.' True. For instance, there used to be a Voting Rights Act. But we don't need it now, because apparently racism is over. Now I can do anything I want and no one can call it racist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, the Supreme Court overturned the Defense of Marriage Act. ... In fact, Bill Clinton hailed the court decision today, even though he signed the Defense of Marriage Act into law. But in fairness to Clinton, he didn't totally understand the law. When he signed the bill, he thought the Defense of Marriage Act was defending marriage as if it were really just an act.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it looks like the NSA leaker, Edward Snowden, is reportedly held up in Moscow's international airport. See, technically, he's not in Russia, because he's in an international area. Yeah. Kind of like being in L.A. Technically, you're not really in America. But it's kind of like being in America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, President Obama personally called and talked to the two lesbians who helped legalize gay marriage in California. Yeah. It was awkward at first, because the women had to put Bill Clinton on hold. Apparently he calls them constantly.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, you know who's stuck in Moscow? That Edward Snowden guy. The leaks guy from the NSA. ... Here's what happened. He was in Hawaii enjoying himself leaking. ... So, he went to Hong Kong and then he got thrown out of the hotel, wouldn't pay his minibar bill, and then he took off from Hong Kong and went to Moscow. And from Moscow, he was supposed to get a flight to Cuba. From Cuba, he was supposed to go to Venezuela and then to Ecuador. ... But here's what happened. The guy got stuck in the Moscow airport and he has been stuck in the Moscow airport for three days. I mean duty-free is fun for a while but?three days in an airport, my God, that's punishment enough. Let the kid go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Referring to Mayor Bloomberg's idea to ban the sale of sparklers) &quot;Folks, you know me, I try to like everybody. But there's one person I despise with a passion - New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. He has repeatedly attacked our smokers, he's attacked our Big Gulps, and now he has attacked our time-honored patriotic tradition. ... Well folks, I don't care what Mayor Buzzstomp over here says. Sparklers deserve a seat at freedom's table.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Oliver:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Referring to negative reactions from Republicans on SCOTUS' DOMA ruling) &quot;If we did everything American voters wanted, we would long ago have replaced our clean water supply with Mountain Dew and Red Bull. The whole point of the Supreme Court is to keep us in check. Sometimes, we as a nation make bad decisions. And the court has to come in and say, 'Sorry, buddy, give us your keys, you're really going to regret segregating schools tomorrow morning.' There is a reason that Lady Justice is blindfolded holding scales and not giving a wink and a thumbs up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Oliver:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The bottom line is, whether or not we get our hands on Edward Snowden any time soon has no bearing on the fact that he is currently screwed. He's in a foreign airport, waiting on a flight that may or may not even exist. As ironic punishments go, that is almost Twilight Zone-level. So, enjoy your meals of tariff-free vodka and Toblerones, Mr. Snowden, because you have checked into the Russian equivalent of the 'Hotel California.' Oh, you can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, the Supreme Court opened the door for same-sex marriage to resume in California. Apparently, the judges are really swayed by that Liberace movie. They said, 'Oh God. Matt Damon and Michael Douglas.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Supreme Court struck down the Defense of Marriage Act, because the Obama Administration and the Justice Department refused to defend it in court. So, it was up to the House of Representatives to defend it. Well, you could see why they lost, come on. A bunch of congressmen defending marriage? Huh? That's like the makers of Mad Dog 20/20 defending Alcoholics Anonymous. It's not going to happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer - remember him? He announced he is running for New York City controller, and one of his opponents is the madam who supplied him with hookers. She is running against him. There's a tough choice for the voters, huh? I mean, one is involved in the most degrading profession of all time, and the other ran a...house [of prostitution].&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former President Bush and First Lady Laura Bush were in Africa last week. They were there on a humanitarian visit. And this to me is the worst part about being president. It's not deciding whether to send troops to war or the daily scrutiny or the schedule. Worst part of being president, I think, is being forced to dance with villagers. Imagine if Lincoln had to do this? He wouldn't be on money.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that Edward Snowden, the super spy Edward Snowden? And he's working for the NSA and he says 'You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to download some stuff and sneak it around.' He's in Hawaii. Pretty good gig, Hawaii staring at a computer all day. Then he says, 'I'm tired of Hawaii; I'm going to Hong Kong.' Then he goes to Hong Kong and he gets tired of the food. So he says, 'I know what I'll do; I'll go to Russia and then I'll go to somewhere else. So he's been in Russia now for about a month living at the airport right there at the Marriott gulag. And so finally Venezuela said, 'Okay, you can come to Venezuela.' But he also got some more great news today. Look at this, Edward Snowden. Cinnabon customer of the month at the Moscow airport.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if you know anything about the local political scene in New York City but the politics are crazy. We have Eliot Spitzer former governor wants to be comptroller and we have Anthony Weiner, former congressman wants to be mayor. And it's gotten crazy and it looks to me like Eliot Spitzer is going to be the new comptroller of New York City. How many of you feel better knowing that he will be comp-trolling things? I just hope he can comp-troll himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is interesting. Political experts are saying that Joe Biden needs to start doing more fundraising if he wants to run for President in 2016.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama's approval rating is down to 44 percent. You can tell Obama's getting desperate, because today he gave a speech entitled 'Hey, Guys, The Twinkie's Coming Back, Next Week.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night we showed a video, Justin Bieber in the kitchen of a restaurant in New York, peeing into a mop bucket and yelling 'F Bill Clinton.' It got a lot of attention. He actually called Bill Clinton to apologize. ? He tweeted about their conversation. He said, '@BillClinton, thank you for taking time to talk, hash tag.' You know it is sincere when there is a hash tag. Bieber reportedly offered to help President Clinton with his charity. Seems like they're on good terms, although at the end of the call it did get a little awkward, when Clinton asked for Selena Gomez's phone number.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, TMZ posted this video of Justin Bieber. I guess he's urinating in a bucket. Yeah, and then he and his buddies are yelling that we're the wild kids. And then he shoots spray cleaner on a photo of Bill Clinton and he says 'F Bill Clinton.' And then he runs away like a wild kid would do. Into the wild, yes. It was not good. Anyways, well, last night Bieber actually called up Bill Clinton and apologized to him. Which I thought was very nice.&quot;</SPAN></P>

I mean, kids, think about finishing up school. Maybe not. When he's not busy with his girlfriend, he's downloading secrets and selling them around the world or something. I don't know.

I've got to say, when they told us that this was going to be a historic presidency, I don't think this was really what everyone had in mind. Now, there are two reasons for this. One, Congress' innate rudeness. Two, under current rules all you need to do to filibuster is say, 'I'm going to filibuster.' You don't have to stand there for 15 hours, hold your pee, read the phone book. It's like a golfer standing at a tee and turning to his caddie and saying, 'I plan to hit a hole in one so why don't you just put me down for one.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, how about Edward Snowden? ... Now he's living at the Moscow airport. Anybody ever spent any time at the Moscow airport? You guys been there? I mean, it's crazy. He's been there for about a month. He's scorned. Edward Snowden, scorned. No home to call his own. No safe harbor.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, this Edward Snowden's been at the airport close to two months. And here's how he stays in shape. He goes jogging every day on the baggage carousel. Now that's a true story.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How can the House be expected to get anything done when many of the bills they vote on don't even repeal Obamacare? For instance, take the immigration reform bill. It is going nowhere in the House of Representatives because it is full of problems. Sure, it massively increases security on the Mexican border, but as Virginia representative and Nordstrom make-up counter victim, Bob Goodlatte points out, the bill 'overlooked the need for border agents in the interior of our country.' Yes, yes, thank you. Our interior borders are defenseless?When will we build the border wall with Florida? We cannot let those maniacs into our country. It is legal to shoot each other down there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And last week, just last week, the House of Representatives proved that they are not do-nothings by done didding something. They passed the farm bill. Now, that might not sound like much. Traditionally the farm bill is a routine piece of legislation which provides government subsidies for farmers while also setting aside money for food stamps. It's a win-win. Help for the folks who grow the corn, and help for folks who live on nothing but corn syrup.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Referring to the House's passing of a scaled-down farm bill) &quot;Yes, farm programs cannot wait. We need to grow the food that people can no longer afford to buy. See, Republicans showed they were willing to compromise by eliminating the part of the bill they refused to compromise on. It's just like a cardiologist who is having problems with a patient's heart. Instead of getting bogged down in complicated procedures, he simply removes the heart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't worry, folks. Do not worry. House Republicans are absolutely going to pass funding for food stamps at some point. And when they don't, if people are still hungry, we'll just combine the food stamp program with the immigration program and let poor people eat Mexicans. The best part is?they are a healthy snack because they pick their own vegetables.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Oliver:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Elliot Spitzer is running for office again, and I've got to say, that is a bold move for man still living down the hideous, embarrassing, career-killing incident where he and a...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It just came out that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton?guess how much she gets paid to give one speech? $200,000, yeah, for one speech. Or as Men's Warehouse put it, cha-ching. A lot of pant suits.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of the Clintons, this is really cool.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, NSA leaker Edward Snowden has filed for temporary asylum in Russia. Apparently he didn't want anyone to know, but somehow the story leaked out. I don't know how that happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former Vice President Dick Cheney's daughter, Liz Cheney, now she is running for the Senate in Wyoming.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anthony Weiner, you know, former Congressman, now running for the mayor. He's on the campaign trail now. Or as he calls it, 'The Tour de Pants.' That's right. That's what he calls it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The TSA just announced that passengers can pass through security without taking their shoes off, if they are willing to pay an extra $85. That explains the TSA's new motto: 'We Catch Terrorists Who Don't Have an Extra $85 on Them.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and we also have former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer on the show tonight! And he'll only be here for about five minutes, but we're charging him for the full hour.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you get shot in Detroit, you can get a pizza faster than you can get a cop. In fact, maybe that's the only way to survive there.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, I've always been suspicious of the minimum wage. I've said it before. Minimum is a misnomer. $7.25? I can think of wages a lot lower. $3.28, $1.19, a pat on the back and a handful of mints. There are literally dozens of other things you could give them. A barn owl.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And when it comes to opposing the minimum wage, I'm in good company with guys who own companies. For example, billionaire industrialist and my future face twin, Charles Koch, in an interview with 'The Wichita Eagle,' said he wants to eliminate the minimum wage, because it creates a culture of dependency and keeps people with limited capital from starting their own business. He is right. Having to pay your employees really hurts small business. I mean, look at our nation's forefathers. Many arrived with nothing but the blouse on their back, but thanks to no minimum wage, they started a booming cotton industry.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to a new study, lying gets easier over time. People get better at lying the more they do it. See, this is why we have term limits.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of lying, Anthony Weiner...is at it again. He admitted today in a press conference to having more online sexting episodes, well after he resigned from Congress. I love this. This time, Anthony Weiner used the name Carlos Danger. He was sexting women under the name Carlos Danger. See, this is Weiner's way of getting more Latino support. ? And you know something? As a comedian, I am pleading with the voters of New York, please elect this man. Please!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator John McCain is leading a group of lawmakers who want to permanently replace the dollar bill with a coin. You know, we already have a coin that replaces the dollar bill. It's called the nickel, okay? 'Cause that's what a dollar bill is worth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The head of the TSA said beginning later this year, people can pay an $85 fee to allow you to go through the airport lines fast with minimal check-in. So, it's pretty much your choice: let the TSA reach into your wallet or reach down the front of your pants. Which one can you afford?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anthony Weiner, he was a Congressman here in New York. And it turned out when Congress was in recess, he would spend time photographing his reproductive organs. And then he would shoot those around to voters. So, then he resigned, and now he wants to be on the ticket for mayor. So, he's running for mayor now, and he says, 'All of this is behind me, and don't worry about it.' Well, today or yesterday, it turns out he may have been involved in some online activity under the name Carlos Danger. I-- I don't have a joke here. I just thought you'd like to know. ? Weiner apologized for this new scandal, I guess. And he apologized for the next one, and for the one after that, and then the one after that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The royal baby was officially welcomed with a 62-gun salute. Because if there's one thing babies love, it's the sound of repeated artillery fire. Experts are predicting that the royal baby could pump $380 million into the British economy. $380 million. So, the question is, how do we get this kid to move to Detroit?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama has issued a statement about the royal baby. Even he's talking about it. ... He told him to hang on to the birth certificate. Those things come in handy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anthony Weiner is in trouble again. After his initial sex scandal, Anthony Wiener sent out more, apparently more, explicit pictures online under the alias Carlos Danger. At a press conference, he said.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anthony Weiner has been caught in yet another sexting scandal.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Obama Administration admitted this week that under Obamacare you might not be able to keep your doctor. First, the President guaranteed you would be able to keep your doctor. Now, they're saying you might be able to keep your doctor. In fact, today, the President was forced to change his slogan from 'Yes We Can' to 'Perhaps We Could Try. We can't promise anything.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, in preparation for his next presidential run, Texas Governor Rick Perry announced that he is going to Israel. You know, I am not sure he is ready. When they asked about the West Bank, he said he keeps all his money in Wells Fargo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll tell you right now, be prepared, the show tonight may run a little longer than usual, and I'll tell you why. We have about 300 Anthony Weiner jokes to get through. Let me just say this: You know that your campaign is not going well when you open a press conference by saying, 'I told you there would be more lewd photos.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anthony Weiner is saying he hopes people will give him a second chance, and I'm all in favor of that; but by my counting, I believe this will be his third chance. Anthony Weiner says some of the accusations are true and some of the accusations are not true. And you know what that means. That means, of course, that they're all true.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Oliver:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But we begin with an event as shocking as it was depressingly predictable. You may remember that last week we covered former Congressman Anthony Weiner and the fact that he wasn't just running for mayor of New York City, but leading in the polls. ? He did it again? Why did he even need to do that? Who did he think had possibly not seen his photo from last time? Did he think that a woman might have been in a coma during the first go-round? So, two years ago this photo caused a scandal that cost him his political career. ? Now, America is collectively experiencing deja-ewwwwww.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Oliver:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He calls himself Carlos Danger. Anthony Weiner's alter ego is a Bolivian action hero slash porn star.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Oliver:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hold on. Let me get this straight. You're spinning this by saying, 'See, I was right all along. I made a promise that there was more sleaze out there and I'm man of my word. Weiner, 2013.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes, New York, New York, the city that never sleeps, just got one more thing to keep it up at night, because yesterday, the thinkable happened. ? These are serious times. This city has serious problems. And I do not want Anthony Weiner as my mayor. I want Carlos Danger. Carlos Danger. A man of whatever the opposite of mystery is. Just think about it, folks. A year after being hounded from office in national, nay, global disgrace for recreational crotch photography, does he stop? No, he presses on. That's the kind of single-minded dedication you need as mayor of New York City, because as Mayor, Carlos Danger will face impossible challenges every day. ? He's not scared of anything, because Carlos Danger's middle name is also Danger.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are comparing Anthony Weiner and Eliot Spitzer. I mean, they're both running for offices in New York, but you really can't compare them.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just think we need a mayor who doesn't come with a nickname, you know? Later, if you want to hold a press conference and say, 'Oh, by the way, I'd like to be known as Carlos Danger, Mayor of New York,' that's fine. But going into the office - &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anthony Weiner's &quot;campaign manager in the race for mayor just quit, because of Weiner's newest scandal. It's tough finding a replacement. Every time he emails someone, they're like 'I'm not opening that.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new sexting scandal was too much, so his campaign manager called it quits. And Weiner was like, 'What kind of candidate quits because of something like that?' And then voters said, 'Ideally, you. You should quit.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton made a trip back to DC today, and actually went back to the White House to have lunch with President Obama, and, you know, measure the drapes.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I heard Great Britain is planning to add a picture of Jane Austen to their currency. Americans are like, 'I wonder when a woman will be on our currency?' Then Hillary was like, 'Soon.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope you're ready, because you have to lock your lungs and batten down your colon, because Obamacare is coming. The individual mandate takes effect on New Year's Day, which means when the Times Square ball drops, it will immediately be checked for lumps.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obamacare is being implemented despite the best efforts of House Republicans, who have voted to symbolically repeal it 39 times. I don't know why it's not working. Maybe they need to load more emptiness into their gestures.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, the key to implementing Obamacare is the so-called individual mandate, because to keep premium costs down, officials say they must register 2.7 million healthy people between the ages of 18 and 35 in order to counteract the costs of ensuring seniors and people with health problems. Don't fall for it, young people. You don't need insurance. You're going to be young and healthy forever. ? Now fortunately, the godfather of the Tea Party movement, FreedomWorks, recently announced a 'Burn Your Obamacare Card' campaign. That's right, young ones. Protest this government overreach by lighting your insurance card on fire. But be careful, because if you burn yourself, you don't have health insurance. There's only one small problem with this burn-your-Obamacare-card plan. There are no such things as Obamacare cards. But FreedomWorks isn't letting a little thing like not existing get in its way.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the 'New York Post,' the Clintons are really angry about being compared to the Weiners, and rightly so. You know, Bill Clinton took his sexual conduct seriously. Anthony Weiner, he just phones it in.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In politics, plus-size New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and Kentucky Senator Rand Paul are in a bit of battle right now. For those who don't know, Rand Paul is RuPaul's straight-edge, conservative brother, something like that. Apparently, Governor Christie criticized Rand Paul for pork-barrel spending, so Rand fired back. He said this is the 'king of bacon' talking about bacon. The king of bacon, is that supposed to be an insult? I would kneel before the king of bacon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it is notable, because Governor Christie is a very large man, and he called him the 'king of bacon.' He had that surgery, though. So far, he's lost about 50 pounds. I hope he gets down to 160 pounds. I would love to see Governor Christie holding an enormous pair of pants above his head like Jared from Subway. Wouldn't that be inspiring?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I tell you, whatever is going on in New Jersey is peanuts compared to what is going on with Anthony Weiner in New York. Today's news was, one of his former interns shared a great story with 'The New York Daily News'. She claims at one point, this is not sexual, he called all 20 interns into his office. He told them, 'Tell me your names, and I'll be able to go around the room and remember all of your names.' And then he started to go around the room and couldn't remember any of their names. He knew their screen names. But he did not know their?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people are saying maybe Anthony Weiner should get out of the race. Maybe he should go run for mayor of Orange County.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Eliot Spitzer says Anthony Weiner should drop out. A lot of top Democrats say he should. Even Silvio Berlusconi said the guy is a creep. Silvio Berlusconi. That's right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know I, for one, always try to keep a level head, but even I am enraged by this Bradley Manning trial. First of all, that he had a trial. Those prisoners in Gitmo must be dying to know how he wrangled that sweet deal. You may remember Bradley Manning as the Wiki-leaker who released the infamous collateral murder video, or perhaps for being the least athletic Manning brother.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, since his arrest three years ago, Manning has been held in solitary confinement for 23 hours a day, forced to sleep naked without pillows and sheets on his bed. But I say he deserves it. For Pete's sake, the guy revealed that the United States tortures, partly through his document leak, but mostly by how we tortured him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Manning was found not guilty of the most serious charge: Aiding the enemy. And even more shocking, he was also found not guilty of shooting Trayvon Martin. Evidently, no one is guilty of that one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday President Obama gave a major speech about the economy at an Amazon distribution center. I think he chose Amazon because they're going to start equipping congressmen with a 'buy now' button.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Referring to a photo of President Obama's lunch with Hillary Clinton) &quot;I don't need news from the cable crowd, because I can analyze the entire 2016 campaign strategy through this lunch. First of all, Hillary's campaign, it is on to the on. And obviously, they ate outdoors to woo the environmentalists. Had the jambalaya to court Gulf Coast-Democrats. President's rolled-up sleeves say, 'I support the right to bare arms.' But the lack of beverages says that under Hillary, there will be no waterboarding, tap or sparkling. And the grilled chicken? It was on sale at Safeway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's talk a little bit about Governor Chris Christie over in New Jersey. ... I love that guy. But now, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul is criticizing Christie for the pork-barrel spending in his state. He even called Governor Christie the 'king of bacon.' Christie would have been offended, but in fairness, that is what it says on his apron.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So actually, here's what Rand Paul said. He said, 'In terms of pork-barrel spending, Christie is the king of bacon.' Low blow. Well, in response, Christie fired back. He said 'That kind of name calling is beneath the office you hold, sir. But just to clarify, would I be the king of real juicy pork bacon or that gross generic turkey bacon?' To which Paul replied, 'What? I don't know, man. Bacon, bacon. Look, your fiscal values are not in line with the Republican Party.' To which Christie said, 'Are you kidding, I'm as Republican as they come. But hey, back to that king of bacon thing. Do you think I wear a crown of bacon or sit on a throne of bacon? Or would I just be all like eating bacon all the time?' To which Paul said, 'Dude, it was just a metaphor. Let it go. My point is your state's spending is out of control.' To which Christie says, 'I'll tell you what's out of control - how much you got me thinking about bacon. You do whatever you want with the Republican Party. I'm about to start a bacon party in my tum-tum.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More and more people calling for Anthony Weiner to step aside. But, in a new ad campaign, Weiner says, 'Quit isn't the way we roll in New York City.' Well, it's better than his old slogan: 'When in doubt, whip it out.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The state of Hawaii is now offering to buy homeless people a one-way ticket to anywhere they want to go just to get them to leave the island. Why can't we offer this same deal to the mayor of San Diego?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Referring to San Diego Mayor Bob Filner (D) controversy) &quot;Communications director Irene McCormack Jackson has filed a harassment suit saying Filner is not fit to hold any public office.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy birthday to President Obama - turned 52 over the weekend. You can see he's getting a little grayer. ... In fact, they're starting to call him the Silver Fox. ... That's because most of the silver in his hair was caused by Fox.&quot;</SPAN></P>

But did you know that our tax system is somehow not universally beloved? ? While we haven't reformed the tax code since 1986, we've certainly added lots of new provisions and loopholes to it. It's like, imagine you have the same refrigerator for the last 27 years. You haven't cleaned it in all of that time. But you keep putting food in there. And now the thing smells so bad you don't even want to touch it. That is America's current tax code.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's hard to believe, but it's been five whole years since the global financial crisis cost the US economy more than $22 trillion, and we're still trying to figure out who to blame. Was it the patriotic bankers willing to put it all on the line to make America the greatest economy in the world, or was it the greedy, reckless home-grubbers looking for the cheap thrill of heat and shelter? And we can argue all day. At this point, who knows which side has better lawyers.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Referring to the news that President Obama will not meet with Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin) &quot;Canceled? Wow, that's a big diplomatic slap in the face, a dip move, if you will. Although if the President really wanted to hurt Putin, he would have said he was coming and just stood him up. Trust me, that hurts a lot more. Or if you wanted to be more passive-aggressive, the President could have just said, 'Let's meet somewhere that's not technically in Russia, like, I don't know, the Moscow airport. Isn't that how it works?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, many of our embassies are closed all around the Middle East this week due to a terrorist threat. What happened was, the US intercepted a conference call of 20 Al Qaeda operatives. Twenty on one conference call. Who is their carrier, okay? I mean, I go under a bridge and my cell phone drops a call. They can connect 20 people in one call from a cave? Who are they using? It's not T-Mobile.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More reports of misconduct by the TSA. Congressman Jeff Duncan, who is chairman of the subcommittee who oversees the TSA - you know the whole pat down people thing?

Seventy-three percent of Georgia Republicans have a favorable opinion of Paula Deen, 11 percent are unfavorable. And only 59 percent have a favorable view of Martin Luther King Jr., 28 percent unfavorable. To be fair, Martin Luther King Jr.'s key lime pie recipe was not very good. But that's crazy, isn't it?

And the hiring process should be easy, since there's already plenty of guys on the subway ready to give pat-downs. ? But folks, this massive expansion comes after reports that TSA misconduct increased 26% over the last three years. Well, that makes sense, because you have to spread misconduct over a broader sample size. Just like if you ever cheat on your girlfriend, you have to get a bunch more girlfriends so you're more faithful per capita. This expansion of the TSA beyond airports is known as VIPR. There's no 'e' in that word, because it was detained for appearing twice in the word 'Yemen.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;San Diego Mayor Bob Filner is now retiring after 18 women have accused him of sexual harassment. See, he was smart to step down and nip this thing in the bud before it became some kind of media circus, you know? ... Eighteen women accusing him of sexual assault. He even groped a great-grandmother. A great-grandmother. Isn't that awful? Even great-grandfathers don't do that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not all bad news for the former San Diego mayor. Today, Bob Filner was offered a new job as a TSA agent at the airport.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And New York City comptroller - I don't even know what that means. Comptroller. But the comptroller candidate Eliot Spitzer says if he wins, he will work for only $1 a year. A dollar a year. Which is pretty smart. Because at that rate, he won't be able to afford another $5,000-an-hour hooker until the year 7013.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The state Attorney General of New York is now suing Donald Trump for $40 million - claiming that Donald Trump University is not a real university. Well, the state claims it's not a real college, because students get very little education and were unable to find jobs after they graduated. Sounds like a real college to me. I guess the attorney general got suspicious it wasn't a real college when Donald took the senior class on a field trip to try and find President Obama's birth certificate.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this NSA scandal just gets worse and worse. This is awful.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you think this NSA surveillance stuff really works?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sen. John McCain got caught in an embarrassing moment yesterday. A photographer from the Washington Post caught him playing poker on his phone during the first public hearing on the potential US military action in Syria. Caught playing poker on his phone. Sounds like something Anthony Weiner would have been caught doing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While some believe it's inappropriate to be playing a video game while the committee is deciding whether or not to kill people and potentially start a war, I say the man is John McCain. The man is 114 years old. We should be impressed he's even wearing pants, never mind he's using a cellphone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it looks like we're getting ready to teach Syria a lesson, and President Obama is now saying that he never used the term 'red line.' Remember when he was talking about if we find out that they used chemical weapons in Syria that that would be crossing a red line, and if they cross that red line, by God, we had to go in there and get them? ... Well, now the President is saying he never used the term 'red line.' He's saying that the world used the term 'red line.' So it's taken him five years, but finally the guy has learned how to bull(bleep).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain. ... They're having a big Senate discussion on whether or not we're going to teach Syria a lesson and?well, during the talk, the discussion, he's playing online poker on his computer. Online poker on his computer during a Senate session on whether we're going to Syria or not. I was stunned! You're telling me John McCain knows how to use a computer?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've been warning you for years that Barack Obama is a weak leader, and he has proven me right once again. ... The man could not lead us on healthcare reform. He could not lead us on the budget talks. And now, he can not lead us into war, specifically, with Syria, where dictator and high school freshman trying to grow a mustache Bashar al-Assad has used chemical weapons against his own people. Now, as the world's policeman, America has a moral imperative to blow some (bleep) up. But thanks to Obama's limp leadership, that idea is going over like a turd falafel. Only 29% of Americans want us to attack Syria. Now, on the plus side, that means 29% of Americans know there is a place called Syria.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I miss George W. Bush. ... That man knew how to sell a war. Obama has hard evidence of weapons of mass destruction, and he can't even get England to go along with it. Meanwhile, President Bush got an international coalition with nothing more than Colin Powell's reputation and half a test tube of Crystal Light.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, President Obama, you could learn a thing or two about salesmanship from this good man. Stop asking our permission and start telling us our peril, like this: 'My fellow Americans, Bashar al-Assad has used poison gas on his own people. If we do not respond, sources say next he will hit Epcot, thereby taking out Paris, London, and China, and it flows over to Disney - that's all of our robotic presidents. Furthermore, we have satellite photos of him punching your mother and sodomizing a baseball. And he has purchased uranium from Hitler's ghost. It is our moral obligation to stop this madman, and if Britain won't help us, I say (bleep) 'em. From now on, English muffins will be called liberty toast, because America, this land is my land and your land, and America does not back down on the face of tyranny.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sen. John McCain is in the news after he was spotted playing poker on his iPhone during a hearing on Syria yesterday. ... Actually, it turns out it's not so bad when you hear that another group of Senators were playing poker with actual cards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;McCain was playing poker during a hearing. The worst part is that he didn't even know he was playing poker. He was just trying to text his wife.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All week, President Obama has been saying he'll seek congressional approval for the strike, but he insists he doesn't really need it. And when asked by the media if he was sending mixed messages, the President said yes and no. Well, despite what the critics say, President Obama says the lack of response to Syria so far does not threaten his credibility. And you know something, he's right. The economy, Benghazi, the spying scandal - that threatens his credibility. But this other stuff, no.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody is criticizing McCain for playing poker on his iPhone. But you know something? Compared to what these other politicians are doing on their iPhones, that's not so bad, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anthony Weiner. This guy just doesn't give up. He got in a big confrontation with a voter in New York City today. Yeah, Weiner said to this guy, 'You have no right to judge me.' Really? I don't think Anthony Weiner understands how voting works.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sen. John McCain is under fire for being caught playing poker on his smart phone during a Senate hearing on Syria. ... Even worse, it was strip poker. That was the worst part. We saw much more of him than we want to see.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Politicians in Siskiyou County, which is a small county up in northern California, voted 4-1 yesterday to move forward with a plan to secede from the state of California. Siskiyou County is more rural than other parts of California. They feel like their needs and interests are not being represented properly, so they want to form their own state. Currently, there are 44,000 people living in Siskiyou County. Why do I feel like if we give them a Chipotle franchise this will all go away?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're hoping to form a coalition of like-minded counties from northern California and southern Oregon and would like to name their new state Jefferson. ... It's like when a five-year-old tells you what she is going to name her baby when she grows up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously, this is not going to happen. It is a bad plan, and I'll tell you why it's a bad plan. This is the United States of America. We're all in this together. But if somebody does decide to leave, I'd like it to be Florida. A lot of weird things going on there. Everyone else stays right where they are.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bill Clinton is traveling the country now, holding little town hall meetings where he explains Obamacare, and after that he will explain twerking. So he's a busy man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bill Clinton admitted he's been cheating on his vegan diet. What? Bill Clinton cheating? ... People became suspicious when Bill said, 'I did not have relations with that pork chop.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a big day in St. Petersburg, Russia. The G-20 summit is going on, and I'm stuck here. But the G-20 is where the heads of government from the wealthiest nations get together. They talk about the global economy, the European recession and Miley Cyrus at the VMAs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But all eyes are on Obama, because of Syria. He wants to use military strikes. Even his allies don't agree with him. Britain wants to use economic embargoes. France wants to use sarcasm. It's a bad sign for the President when he can split the summit into two groups: those who hate him for Syria and those who hate him for eavesdropping.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, it's election season here in the Big Apple. We're choosing a new mayor to replace Michael Bloomberg, who sadly was lost in the couch cushions at the Gracie Mansion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republican leaders have agreed to support President Obama's plan to attack Syria. See, this is what I love about our country. Only time Republicans and Democrats agree on something is when it's time to bomb somebody.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the President said the message is clear...chemical weapons should not be used to kill civilians, period. That's what drones are for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know something? If the President really wants to hurt the Syrian government, don't send cruise missiles. Send over some of his economic advisers. They'll take care of it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, did you see Vladimir Putin and President Obama shaking hands today? And they said something to each other. We don't know what they said. Nobody does except NSA, KGB and Edward Snowden.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Tuesday, President Obama's planning to address the nation. Instead of calling for his plan to attack Syria a war, he's calling it a 'limited military intervention,' which sounds better than 'potential endless quagmire.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Secretary of State John Kerry said that Arab countries have offered to pay the entire cost of unseating Syria's president. They will pay for the whole thing. This is how global politics work. We invade Syria to get money from Saudi Arabia that they got from us for putting their oil in our Japanese cars so we could pay back China all the money we owe them. You follow me? You follow? You see how that works?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, a new report released yesterday showed that illegal drug use among the elderly is surging. Everything from marijuana to meth. Can you imagine? And you can tell the ones that are on meth. They're the ones playing 30 bingo cards at a time.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. Good evening from the Tostitos Oval Office</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Remember how we thought we'd killed bin Laden?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Allow me to explain the situation using puppets</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Great news - China just bought San Diego</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Where's Forest Whitaker with my coffee?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. We do not yet know who created these super-intelligent squirrels</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. I've deployed three warships: The Roker, The Bieber and the Weiner</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. I won't sugarcoat things; we're screwed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. By now you've seen and evaluated my underpants photo</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Dead silence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Syria agreed to a tentative plan to hand over all its chemical weapons to Russia. ... Vladimir Putin said, 'And those weapons better not be gay.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was a primary for the mayor of New York city. ... But get this - the city had to use old lever voting machines from the '60s, because the electronic machines were too hard to program. ? That's right. New York City used old lever-voting machines from the 1960s, which got weird when the officials checked the results and said the winner is Richard Nixon. The newer machines were not properly programmed, or as Florida put it, 'Never stops us.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, President Obama had two separate lunches with Republicans and Democrats in the Senate, to press them on the need for action in Syria. Two lunches, or as Chris Christie put it, 'Maybe I do want to be President.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The upshot is that America will not attack Syria for gassing its citizens if they give up their chemicals weapons. It is like if you decapitate a co-worker, so they are taking away your ax. But you get to keep your job and your hatchet.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In New York, last night, former Congressman Anthony Weiner was the first candidate to concede in his bid to become the Democratic candidate for mayor. Not sure who won the election - all I know is Anthony Weiner lost. He got less than five percent of the vote and came in fifth. That is a shame. There's got to be something else he can run for. I have 3,000 more Weiner jokes. Maybe I can get him on 'Dancing with the Stars.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday we had an election here in New York City. Guess what? Anthony Weiner is not going to be mayor of New York City. You think you're disappointed, for God's sake. ... It was interesting - he gave his concession speech, then he gave everyone the finger. Honest to God. You've got to be careful, because that's the kind of thing people will remember.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New Yorkers are going to miss Anthony Weiner. ... Because it's always nice having someone around who makes you feel morally superior, you know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Anthony Weiner [was asked], 'What are you going to do now?' He said, 'I'm going to take some time off, couple of weeks, probably spend a couple weeks, maybe a month, spend some time with my cell phone.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you are following the news, you know that this is an exciting time in New York City politics. Just yesterday, voters turned out to nominate replacements for outgoing Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Someone's got to fill this man's shoes, which is why I cast my vote for an American girl doll.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, if you remember, last week on this very show, I endorsed Republican mayoral candidate Joe Lhota, because after two kittens stranded on the tracks forced the subway line to stop service for several hours, Lhota was the only candidate with the courage to come out as pro-crushing kittens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Lhota now moves on to the general election, where he's likely facing Democratic candidate Bill de Blasio, a man so liberal, he won the gay vote against a lesbian. Folks, de Blasio?must be stopped. This mad man wants to raise taxes on those making more than half a million dollars a year, costing guys like me about $973. $973? I'll have to stop buying my yearly pair of Gucci python loafers. How will I know it's spring? Even worse, de Blasio tricked voters by running this heartwarming ad featuring his biracial family, a cynical strategy that Bloomberg rightly called 'racist.' Yes, what is more racist than falling in love with a black woman and fathering a child just so you can claim you're against stop and frisk?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, there's an even bigger biracial problem in this country - Barack Obama. Last night, our so-called Commander in Chief attacked our Tuesday night lineup to talk about Syria. We had to miss 'America's Got Talent,' just to watch 'America's Got Serious Reservations About This.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I say if Obama really wanted to sell us Syria, he should have taken a page from the people selling us Siri, because pushing the iPhone and a war are a lot alike. You just say that the new one is smaller, faster, and cheaper, and people will buy it, even though they've already got one and they're still paying off the previous model.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, folks, there it is. Crisis averted. Now, Congress suspends its vote on a military strike, the UN secures Assad's chemicals stockpiles, and the Syrian people can go back to being killed with conventional weapons. Everybody wins. Of course, that's just my analysis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Referring to de Blasio's family) &quot;There is his wife, Shirley McCray, which, until she met her husband, was a devout lesbian, which we know from her 1979 article. This is why de Blasio can win. The Democrats love him because he is an old-fashioned conservative. And this is why Republicans love him - because he can turn gay people straight. What's better than that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And did you see this? Anthony Weiner's former sexting partner Sydney Leathers - she actually showed up at his official primary party, which was also attended by Weiner's wife. Weiner was like, 'What is she doing here? She's going to ruin my chances with Sydney Leathers.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, President Obama spoke to the nation about Syria. And hopefully, Americans who are confused about the President's plan feel better now knowing that he's confused, too. Well, it was confusing, wasn't it? First, President Obama laid out his reasoning for a strike against Syria. And then he gave the rebuttal. Here's the really weird part. After all that, he introduced Apple's new iPhone 5s.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the speech last night, President Obama asked for support from his friends on the left and his friends on the right. Apparently, he thinks he has a lot more friends than he really does.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, he called on Congress to delay voting on any military action in Syria. He's asking for the time being, Congress do nothing. Well, that shouldn't be too hard for them, huh? That's the one thing they're good at.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to the Pentagon, Syria has 1,000 metric tons of deadly chemicals. That is enough to make over 10 million Twinkies, do you realize?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry has insisted that any military strike on Syria will be unbelievably small. Not as small as the support for a strike on Syria. ... No, Kerry claims a military strike will send a message to Iran. And today, Syria said, 'If you want to send a message to Iran, bomb Iran. Bomb that guy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Weiner's sexting partner, Sydney Leathers, remember the woman he was sexting? She crashed his concession speech. She was there last night. Here's the embarrassing part - she got more votes for mayor than he did.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The New York Times today published an unusual op-ed piece. It was unusual, because it was written by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Putin is taking his case on Syria directly to the American people. I like that he thinks we read the New York Times op-ed section. Unless he had it published in the crossword puzzle section, 99% of us will never even see it. But in the article, he warns against what he calls American exceptionalism. On Tuesday, you know, President Obama called Americans exceptional. He said we're different from other countries. But Putin disagrees with that. He wrote, 'It is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional, whatever the motivation.' Sound like a fun dad, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Putin said that when Americans claim to be exceptional it offends other countries around the world. This from the man who regularly arrests his political opponents and persecutes people based on sexual orientation and who put a girl group in a labor camp for singing songs he didn't like. So it's not that we think we're better than everyone else, we just think we're better than you, specifically.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if you know this or not, but it's quite a week for me, because Eliot Spitzer lost his race for comptroller. Anthony Weiner lost his race for New York City mayor. ? So that means I am back to being New York City's biggest embarrassment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not a great day for American politicians. They are all a bit embarrassed. I'm like, what? What could they possibly be embarrassed about? Well, they are embarrassed because Russian President Vladimir Putin wrote a scolding op-ed piece in the New York Times. I think he is adorable. He thinks people still read the New York Times. He should have tweeted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you haven't seen the New York Times piece, Putin said America should stay out of Syria. And then he said Khloe should dump Lamar.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are outraged that Vladimir Putin wrote for one of our newspapers. But Putin is no stranger to American journalism. A couple of years ago, he wrote a letter to Penthouse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, as promised let's talk about that Putin guy. ? How dare the New York Times print the propaganda of a homicidal KGB klepto. ... I assume he's filling in for Maureen Dowd this week while she's on vacation with polonium poisoning. Because news flash, New York Times: He murders journalists. We don't do that in America. We just let you starve to death in your dying industry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thinking are you exceptional is not extremely dangerous. It's exceptionally dangerous. Folks, I was on the fence before this, but now it's clear we've got to bomb Syria. I mean, massive air strikes. And just to stick it to Putin, I say we use lesbian pilots flying the Enola Gay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Referring to Obama's speech on Syria) &quot;The President on Tuesday night interrupted the prime time schedules of every major television network to walk down 'I Killed bin Laden Lane' and make the case for American intervention in Syria. Because going ahead and making the speech even after the Russians made that offer, and the Syrians accepted it, was the best thing to do. Not because they had put a deposit down on that time before momentum swung to a more peaceful resolution and apparently they can't get their money back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Russian President Vladimir Putin actually wrote an op-ed piece in the New York Times, where he said it's dangerous for Americans to see themselves as exceptional. Then he said...'Except for that Timberlake, that guy is freaking amazing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Putin said it's dangerous for Americans to see themselves as exceptional, and said that, quote, 'God created us equal.' Then, he got back to arresting people for being gay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, Vladimir Putin, you know, the Russian president. ... He wrote an op-ed piece for the New York Times. Putin said he wanted to reach the American people directly. That shows you how little Putin knows about America. If you want to reach the American people, you don't put it in the newspaper. You go on 'Dancing with the Stars.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Government officials in Syria have finally admitted, yes, they do have weapons of mass destruction. Today, former President George Bush said, 'That's where they were! I was so close! I was so - I knew they were around there.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Syrian President Assad says he is turning over his chemical weapons, because Russia asked him to, not because of the US threatening to bomb him. Oh, yeah, yeah. And Osama bin Laden? He's at the bottom of the ocean right now, because he enjoys scuba diving.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, it was also revealed today that the CIA has begun delivering weapons to the rebels in Syria. Now, before you get outraged, the rebels have promised not to use those weapons against us until after they topple Assad. So, phew. So, we got a month.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, even if we do get rid of Assad, we still have much bigger problems. What the hell do we do with Anthony Weiner? You know how much free time he's going to have now? Well, at his concession speech, former New York mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner said he had the best message, but he was an imperfect messenger. Oh, shut up. It wasn't that he was an imperfect messenger. It was that people were afraid to open his messages.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Russian President Vladimir Putin wrote an op-ed in the New York Times asking the US to be more civilized. Unfortunately, Putin couldn't go finish it, because he had to take his shirt off and arrest gay people.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You may not remember, but I do. Five years ago today, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy triggering the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Bet you all had forgotten. But I even got you a cake. ... It's actually a bunch of cake - some fresh, some spoiled, bundled into a larger cake derivative, all right. Now, fair warning: there might be some poop in there, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, folks, it feels like only yesterday that banks were taking unethical risks with everyone's money, because they were also doing it yesterday. But America is defined by its resilience. No matter what mistakes we make, we pick ourselves up, we dust ourselves off, and come together with the courage to deny that we ever made a mistake.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The point is, America's economy is back. The Dow is reaching record highs. The housing market is rebounding. The auto industry exists. And even young people are finding good jobs in construction. And folks, this is good for everyone. As they say, a rising tide lifts all boats. Also, buy a boat or you'll drown. Because 95% of income gains since the recovery have gone to the top 1%.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But don't fret, not-rich people. You will get your share, because our economy is like a pyramid. We rich are at the peak, and soon the money will start trickling down to you people, so be patient. And if you are good, you can be buried with me in my pyramid. So, if you are a middle-class American wondering where all the money in this recovery went, don't worry, it's in good hands. Living with me now. By the way, the money says, 'Hi!' It wants you to know that it's happy now, and it wants you to be happy too. But you have to move on because it's not coming back. In fact, it's gone to a farm upstate - in that I used it to buy a large farm upstate.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Forbes' magazine has come out with its annual list of the 400 richest people in America. And 399 of them were bankers that got us into the recession five years ago. What are the odds of that? ... You know...this week marks the fifth anniversary of the collapse of Lehman Brothers, which of course sparked the recession. Think about how bad things were back then. We had unemployment...over 7%. The debt was out of control. There were wars breaking out all over the globe. Thank God that's all behind us now, huh? Whoo. Thank God we don't have to worry about that anymore.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'USA Today' had a big front page feature on the new healthcare law - said that the opposition to Obamacare was at an all-time high. It has gotten so bad the President is now calling it 'Bidencare.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Joe Biden was in Iowa over the weekend, raising speculation that he plans to run for President in 2016. Yes. Biden said that he and the President have had a 'laser-like' focus on the middle class. That's what happened to the middle class. They didn't disappear. They got zapped by a laser.&quot;</SPAN></P>

I'm afraid all that money is my cross to bear. It's a cross made of solid gold. Very nice, actually.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Brazilian hacker group launched a cyberattack against the NSA website in retaliation of the reports that the NSA spied on the Brazilian president. Unfortunately though, instead of hacking the NSA, they accidentally hacked NASA. And?that's why Brazilian hackers never win 'Wheel of Fortune.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last week, Russian President Vladimir Putin wrote an opinion piece that was published in the New York Times. It was a letter directed at the American people, and in response, Sen. John McCain just wrote his own op-ed that was published on a Russian news website. The piece was titled 'Russians Deserve Better Than Putin,' and he really called Putin out. He exposed him for the thug that he is. He did. You have to give him credit for it. In fact, he dissed the Russian president so hard, there's speculation he may have collaborated with Kendrick Lamar.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unfortunately, there was some confusion when it came to publishing the letter. McCain intended it to be published in 'Pravda,' which is one of Russia's oldest and respected newspapers. But instead, it was published on the website Pravda.ru, which has no affiliation with the newspaper at all, and it appears that the letter went through some kind of government filter before it was posted, which, I guess, isn't surprising for a country that still doesn't have freedom of the press. But what was surprising was the tone of the translation. It almost seemed friendly, which was not how it was intended. This is how it was translated, 'Vladimir Putin is very sexy man and very strong like bear or bull. If I were lady, I would sex him. I am not lady. Therefore, I envious his muscles and strong eyes, but not in gay way. Putin is hero!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Fourth US Circuit Court of Appeals just made an interesting decision about Facebook. They said that liking something on Facebook is considered free speech and is, therefore, protected under the First Amendment. The case went to court because a former deputy sheriff in Virginia claimed he was fired for liking the Facebook page of the candidate running against his boss for sheriff. Which, the real takeaway is, do not Facebook friend your boss under any circumstances.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is also a great day for Russia. Or is it? Vladimir Putin says he's going to run for a fourth term as president in 2018. He has already decided. He has come up with a great campaign slogan: 'Vote for me or be executed.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Michelle Obama is a lovely lady, friend of the show. But ever since she started her 'Let's Move' campaign to combat childhood obesity, she's been cramming her pro-health agenda down our throats. Throats that should be packed with chili cheese fries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm also not a huge fan of Barack. From day one, I have vowed to stop Obamacare or die trying. And knowing my luck, I'd almost die and then get nursed back to life by Obamacare.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the Republicans and Democrats can't get together, there's a strong possibility of a Federal government shutdown. You know what the legal definition of that is? A government shutdown is when Congress continues not to work, but they do it from home. See, they don't work. First of all, why do we call it a government shutdown? We are $17 trillion in debt. Why don't we call it a going out of business sale?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pundits say President Obama is starting to lose support from his own party. Give you an idea how bad it's gotten. Today, Jimmy Carter compared him to Jimmy Carter.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Syrian President Assad told Fox News that if he were ever to talk to President Obama, he would tell Obama to listen to your own people.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a Fox News poll, most Americans don't understand Obamacare. You know why? Cause it's not in Spanish. That's why they don't understand it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Critics are saying that Obamacare will require doctors to ask you about your sex life. See, that is outrageous. Because your sex life is between you and the NSA, okay? And nobody else has any right to listen in or see those pictures.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, President Obama met with the President of Nigeria, who advised President Obama to eliminate America's debt by sending out fraudulent emails. Just keep sending out fraudulent emails.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama now making a case for raising the debt limit. He said that raising the debt limit does not increase debt. And, you know, I got to defer to the President on this one, because when it comes to increasing the debt, Obama knows what he's talking about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, today Texas Senator Ted Cruz began a filibuster on the Senate floor. He's trying to stop Obamacare and he vowed to keep speaking until he is no longer able to stand. And the good news - if he collapses from exhaustion, he'll be covered under Obamacare.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the voice of reason, Sarah Palin, has entered the fray. She's now giving her support to Ted Cruz's filibuster. I think she's a little confused. She said she's been a big fan of Ted Cruz ever since she saw 'Top Gun.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During a big antelope hunt this past weekend, former Vice President Dick Cheney's gun apparently malfunctioned. Gun didn't fire, couldn't get off a shot. Didn't stop Cheney - he actually grabbed the antelope and then water-boarded him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's so exciting when they open the UN. They have a special theme this year - 'Enchantment Under the Sea.' Very nice. ? We have world leaders from all over the world - dictators, presidents, kings, queens, that kind of thing, for the UN opening up. And when they come here, they have what they call diplomatic immunity. They can do whatever they want. They can break any kind of laws. I saw a dictator today walking up Broadway carrying a 16-ounce soda.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Home Depot just announced that that it will cut health insurance for its part-time workers, because of Obamacare. Home Depot's CEO said he had a hard time breaking the news to employees. You know, because it took him three hours to find one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I saw that New Jersey Governor Chris Christie - that's my man. He's a great guy. Well, anyways, he's running a new Spanish-language commercial for his re-election campaign. Which seems like a stretch, because, like, the only Spanish phrase he knows is 'Yo quiero Taco Bell.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Russian president Vladimir Putin just revealed he may run for a fourth term in 2018. Yep. In fact, he already came up with a few campaign posters. Let's take a look at this first one. It says, 'I will put middle class families first (on the bus to Siberia).' You've got to read the parentheses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You guys hear about Dick Cheney over the weekend? ? He entered a shooting contest. And it turns out his gun malfunctioned and didn't fire. It wasn't good. In fact, he ended up having to just throw some ammo in his friend's face.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, next Tuesday, October 1st?is the day that Obama's healthcare is open for sign up. I like my healthcare like I like my women, universal and with a waiting list for nonessential procedures.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess if you really, sincerely believe this (Obamacare) is a terrible program that Americans will hate, I have to respect your principled stand, Ted Cruz. ? You are protecting America from this terrible Obamacare plan that, once we get a taste of, we'll never want to be without. You only win if the program fails. Obamacare is your 'Springtime for Hitler.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll tell you what happens midnight, October 1: The United States government...shuts down. At midnight, yeah. And right now in Times Square, they're getting ready to drop the ball. People say they're closing down the government, they get scared. I'll give you an example: Diana Nyad swam back to Cuba.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Federal government will shut down and only essential employees will remain. The Presidential chief of staff will remain when the government shuts down. Economic advisers will stay in place when the government shuts down. And White House butler Forrest Whitaker. Those are the three.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, how about that senator from Texas, Ted Cruz? ? He gets ahold of the microphone, the floor of the Senate, and he starts talking, and people are thinking, 'Oh, well, it's Ted, let him go for a while.' Twenty one hours...ladies and gentlemen. He's yakking for 21 hours. I'm telling you, that government shutdown certainly looks pretty good now, doesn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Twenty-one hours. I don't think I've talked for 21 hours in my entire life. And at one point he takes out?'Green Eggs and Ham.' You know the kiddie book? He's reading 'Green Eggs and Ham,' and the whole thing was Obamacare. And the message he was sending there, I think, is Obamacare will only cover visits to Dr. Seuss.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, I don't know if you've been watching the news, but what an historic night, destined to be down in the annals of importance. After an equally historic yester-last night, when one devoted crusader - or should I say one Devo-Ted-Cruz-ator - talked about the need to defund Obamacare for 21 hours and 19 minutes and did what many thought was impossible - make the Senate even less productive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This courageous man is fighting to defund Obamacare by filibustering a bill that defunds Obamacare. And what makes it truly courageous, the bill was his idea. And it's not really a filibuster. Cruz knew in advance he'd have to yield the floor by noon today. I believe the room was booked for Danny Goldstein's bar mitzvah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not saying Obamacare is perfect. It's not. It was designed by Congress. Nothing designed by Congress is perfect. You ask them to design a puppy, you'd get something with no face, two [bleep] and a semiautomatic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During his protest, Cruz actually read from the book 'Green Eggs and Ham' by Dr. Seuss. Democrats were like, 'When will this end?' While Chris Christie was like, 'When do we get those eggs and ham?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, despite all of the controversy, President Obama says he's still moving forward with the healthcare law. In fact, the White House announced that residents of Florida will have 102 different insurance options when Obamacare rolls out. ... Because if there's one thing we know people in Florida love, it is a confusing number of options. That's going to work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Republicans and Democrats are trying to agree on a spending bill to avoid a government shutdown. You know, if the government does shutdown, one of the first services that will stop will be processing of passports and visas. You know what that means? Some foreigners may try to enter this country illegally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, 'Breaking Bad' has its final episode on Sunday. As you know?it's the story of this chemistry teacher. He teaches chemistry in high school. And he has cancer and starts making meth to help cover his medical bills and provide for his family. Or as Republicans call that, a legitimate alternative to Obamacare.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In his effort to try and stop Obamacare, Texas Senator Ted Cruz spoke for 21 hours and 19 minutes nonstop. Nonstop. Impressive, but still eight hours short of the record held when somebody asked Joe Biden, 'Hey, what's new?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Twenty-one hours of listening to Ted Cruz. How awful is that? Still not as bad as 21 hours of a Carnival cruise, but still bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You all know crazy Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. He spoke for 21 hours on the floor of the Senate. Just talking and talking and talking until he could barely stand. And coincidentally, after 21 hours nobody could barely stand him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaker of the House John Boehner says Americans don't want healthcare. ...Well, there you go. Conclusive evidence, too much time in the tanning bed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bill Clinton was in the news this week because he gave this interview and he said that his daughter Chelsea would actually be a better president than Hillary. You can tell Hillary's mad. Because tonight she kicked him off the couch and made him sleep in their bed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well in a letter to John Boehner, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew said the government will run out of money in just three weeks. You know, I'm no financial whiz, but we're $16 trillion in debt. Doesn't that mean we already ran out of money?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The post office is now asking for a three-cent increase to 49 cents for first-class mail. They say it's needed because fewer and fewer people are using the post office and they're losing money. See, that's government thinking. Only the government would think, 'Hey, I know how to attract more customers. Let's raise the price.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama now making his case for raising the debt limit. He said raising the debt limit does not increase debt. You know, like raising the speed limit does not increase speed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, yesterday, Sen. Ted Cruz spoke for 21 hours straight on the Senate floor against Obamacare. And believe me, it got pretty boring. In fact, politicians were comparing it to a 15-minute speech by John Kerry.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know, since we tape earlier, we don't know if there was any kind of last-minute deal before the government shutdown. But, both sides are blaming each other. The Republicans are pointing their fingers at Democrats. Democrats are pointing their fingers at the Republicans. And Americans are pointing the middle finger at both of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This whole thing comes down to who will blink first. Well, we know it won't be Nancy Pelosi. We know that for sure. Because she hasn't blinked since the last shutdown 17 years ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, since 1976, there have been 17 government shutdowns. The longest was during the four years that Jimmy Carter was President. That was the longest one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's see what else is going on. Sen. Ted Cruz's 21-hour talk-a-thon has skyrocketed him into the presidential race. As far as conservatives go, he leads the field. Well, there were questions if he could run, because he was born in Canada. See, that sums up the American dream right there. When a Latino born in Canada can come to America and, by attacking the money we borrowed from China, can become a front-runner of a party who believes the President was born in Kenya.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney has broken his silence. Mitt Romney said it's time to stop Obamacare, because it's a bad law that will hurt the country. Well, he should know. He invented it. So, there you have it right there. No, that's what Romney said. He said we must stop Obamacare, now. And then, the kid behind the counter at McDonald's said, 'Do you want the large drink or not?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government's shutting down. Is it tomorrow night? About 24 hours from now they're shutting down. Do you care the government's shutting down? I thought they were shut down. And Americans don't care. ? The last time Americans cared about anything was when they shut down the Twinkie factory.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some national parks will be shut down, some museums, some national monuments will be shut down. For example, down in Washington, they're going to close the Smithsonian. So, if you have tickets, forget it. You're not getting in. They're going to close the Smithsonian. They're going to close the Air and Space Museum. You're not getting into there. They're closing the Hillary Clinton Pants Suit Museum.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For those just joining the story in progress, our government is going to shut down in 57 of your earth minutes. Because the House Republicans are refusing to fund the government, unless the rest of Congress delays implementation of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare - also known as the 'End of America as We Know It For Reasons No One is Able to Clearly Explain.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The best part about the finale of 'Breaking Gov' is that the bad guys are all getting eliminated - the National Park Service, the Center for Disease Control, NASA, which is slated to furlough 97% of its employees immediately. And the government hadn't even shut down yet, but the reviews are already in. Michele Bachmann raves: 'We're very excited. It's exactly what we wanted and we got it.' And California Rep. Devon Nunez says conservative Republicans are 'all giddy about it.' Of course they're giddy. They will still get paid in the event of a shutdown.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you watched the news at all today, you know that we are on the verge of a government shutdown. It is bad, because we need to keep the government working so they can continue to not do things on our behalf. What's happening is a group of very motivated House Republicans...are refusing to let a budget pass unless provisions are included to defund Obamacare. ? President Obama gave a speech suggesting this is a hostage situation, but the Republicans said they are not holding America hostage and if he would bother to read their ransom note that would be perfectly clear.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government shutdown has happened before. The last one was in 1996, but the debate on this one is particularly heated, because people have such strong opinions about Obamacare. The polls show that Americans don't like Obamacare, but they like what's in it. It's like the opposite of a McNugget.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, we got the government shutdown, but Obamacare has started. You know what that means? You can now complain to your doctor about the government making you sick. How many are worried about the government shutdown? How many more are worried about it starting back up?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me tell you something. I am glad the government has shut down. Think about it. For the first time in years, it's safe to talk on the phone and send emails without anybody listening in. This is fantastic! You can talk to whoever you want!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ironically, during the shutdown, hundreds of thousands of nonessential employees, government employees, will be laid off because of - well, because of our non-intelligent employees in Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We do have a lot of nonessential employees. Think about this. Like the Treasury Secretary. Why is he there? We don't have any money in the Treasury. He's got nothing to do. The room is empty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The United States government, the most powerful country, shut down, not in business. Put the out-of-business sign in the White House, nothing happening here. We are like a Carnival Cruise on land.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government just shut down. After Congress failed to reach an agreement on the new spending bill, the Federal government has officially shut down, so roads won't get fixed, public employees won't be able to help you, and getting a Federal loan for a house will be very difficult. But there will also be a lot of differences.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Members of Congress were drinking last night while debating the government shutdown. Which explains that one part where they said, 'The floor recognizes the representative from Margaritaville.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you, folks, thank you for being here. Thank you for braving the marauding gangs and packs of wild dogs that now rule the night in America! Because as of midnight last night, the government of the United States officially closed for business. Finally, a chance to use our famous nation-building skills right at home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, folks, the Federal government may be shuttered, but the Colbert Nation is alive and well. And I am proud and prepared to fill the power vacuum as your Lord of the Afterscape! Bow before me! Bring me tributes of sheep and unsoiled daughters! I also accept Visa! I will seize all government functions. Who needs the FDA? Just send me your drugs. I'll test them for you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To be honest, I didn't notice the government was shut down today. But the 800,000 government employees who had their hours cut or jobs taken away definitely did. But the good news is Congress is still getting paid. I want the names of the idiots who elected these people - oh, wait, it was us? Never mind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is something the Huffington Post reported, that while the Congressmen were allegedly trying to work out a deal last night, some of them were drinking. ? You'd think a bunch of drunk guys can get along. When I am drunk, I will agree to anything. I will help you move, tell you I love you, father a child with you. You name it. I guess that's not the same effect when you are in Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Crucial agencies like the US Border Patrol are still on the job. That's a good thing. The last thing we need is an influx of Canadians, with their politeness and a government that's open every day.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are saying now that before the government shutdown, congressmen went out and got drunk. Went out and got drunk, celebrating that they had shut down the government. I tell you, ladies and gentlemen, this is the kind of thing that could hurt, could damage their 10 percent approval rating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They have what they call now the Obamacare, and when you sign up for the Obamacare, you get different programs. You get the bronze program, you get the silver program, you get the gold program or the platinum. Now, people say to me, 'Dave, what is the difference?' Here's all I know: If you sign up for the platinum, you actually get to drive the ambulance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But?it's another bad day for the American government. It's still shut down tighter than Bruce Jenner's forehead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Statue of Liberty is closed. No government means nobody's allowed near that beautiful gift from France. The French were like 'mehhh.' Then they heard about the Statue of Liberty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Personally, I don't think people are paying enough attention to fact that the National Zoo is closed. The panda cam has been dark for 48 hours. Who knows what craziness those pandas are up to now?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, there was a report today that the CIA has stopped paying some of its spies. That's not good. What kind of democracy doesn't pay people for betraying their friends?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of Republicans are hoping Democrats will eventually give in. I'm not so sure. If you're waiting for Nancy Pelosi to blink, it may be a while. You know what I'm saying? I don't know if it's technically possible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Look, I may have over the past few days leading up to and through the government shutdown thrown around some rather derisive terms to describe those in Congress who have decided to not fund the government because of a past law they don't like went into effect. I might have mentioned the word idiot, dunderheads, morons. ... I guess my point is, I'd like to apologize because I realize I may have been way too easy on them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government shut down. It just shut down. Now, we're in day two, now, of this whole mess and no one knows when the government will be back up and running. So, if you ever wanted to cut the tag off of your mattress, do it now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because the government doesn't have any money, NASA had to close a Twitter account that warns the public about asteroids. So, if you're someone who constantly checks Twitter to see if an asteroid's coming, would an asteroid really make your life any worse?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Several Washington reporters tweeted that multiple congressmen were visibly drunk in the moments right before the shutdown. It was pretty obvious. Just take a look at some of the bills they passed at the last minute. First, they passed the No Taco Left Behind Act. That's a good one. Next, there is a resolution making the official time in Washington 5:00 somewhere. Here's another one. It's a motion making Gatorade and cold pizza part of the food pyramid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some more craziness in Washington, yesterday. Joe Biden was spotted holding a document with the word 'Classified' on it in front of a bunch of White House reporters. It's a real photo. ... 'Classified'. Right there. Yeah. Nothing says Joe Biden like the codeword for your classified document actually being called codeword. That's a real photo. Codeword, codeword. That's right, Joe Biden was waving around a classified document in front of reporters, but false alarm. It turns out it was just a bunch of cheat codes for Grand Theft Auto V.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as you know, all nonessential employees were sent home, like president Obama's economic team. They all got sent home. Well, to all you nonessential employees that have been forced out of your job. Hey, I work for NBC, I know how you feel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a recent poll of AOL users, 51 percent of respondents blame the Republicans for the shut down, while 49 percent blame the Democrats. Isn't that amazing? There are still people using AOL.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because of the shutdown, even the Smithsonian Institute is closed. And as a result, tourists who come to Washington and want to see historical relics are now being sent to John McCain's office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, you can see the effects of the shutdown all over town, it's terrible. President Obama now down to just one teleprompter. That's how bad it is.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm glad you are here on day three of the government shutdown. During a speech in Maryland today, President Obama blamed the shutdown on House Speaker John Boehner and then John Boehner blamed it on the a-a-a-alcohol.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can see, we are really at a standstill, here. The shutdown is costing us $300 million a day. That is a full 'Ironman' sequel per day. We could be up to 'Ironman 7' by tomorrow, but we're not because of this.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What they call nonessential government services have been put on hold. Flight safety inspectors have been furloughed. National monuments closed. Even the Grand Canyon, it's closed. They filled it with spackle too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Marlin Stutzman, which is not a name I made up - that is a real person. He is one of the Congressmen who's responsible for the shutdown. Marlin dug his heels in, and he said, 'We're not going to be disrespected. We have to get something out of this. And I don't know what that even is.' That's what he said. Quite a rallying cry, by the way. 'What do we want? I have no idea! When do we want it? Couldn't possibly tell you.' Maybe if he didn't want to be disrespected, he shouldn't have run for Congress in the first place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is taking advantage of the government shutdown, and it was announced earlier today that he has furloughed his mother-in-law.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many folks got signed up on the Obamacare? Got it right with you? Are you okay? Good. Here's what you got. You sign up, you have four plans, four ways to win and win big. You've got the bronze plan. You have the silver plan. You have the gold plan. You have the platinum plan. Now, let me break this down for you a little bit. If you go with the platinum plan, you get two choices. You get the morphine, if you need it. Or the morphine con queso.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Three days. Three days. The National Zoo has been shut down for almost 90 hours. Inside the walls, adorable panda bears have risen up and formed their own society. And guess what? Even they were able to pass a budget.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now nation, it is day three of the government shutdown and it is a critical moment in our nation's history. And not just because yogurts left by furloughed Federal workers are passing their expiration date.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Referring to White House meetings on government shutdown) &quot;That's right, the only thing they've actually agreed on was that they made no progress. But that agreement is itself progress. So, the only thing they agreed on was wrong, and now we are back to square one. Now folks, Republicans don't want to shut the government down. They want to end this stalemate and get back to the important work of crippling the government.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, the two parties are at a stalemate, but luckily the GOP has one of the stalest mates of all, Indiana Congressman Marlin Stutzman. He told the Washington Examiner, 'We're not going to be disrespected. We have to get something out of this, and I don't even know what that is.' There you have it, Mr. President. A clear signal of what Obama needs to offer: something.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just tell Republicans if they agree to end this impasse they can get whatever is in this secret mystery box. I mean, what could it be? The complete dismantling of Obamacare, the Keystone XL pipeline, or is it a lovely dinette set courtesy of Broyhill?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, President Obama had an hour-long meeting with Republicans and Democrats, and they still were unable to end the situation. So, don't worry, while the shutdown is putting people out of work and costing people taxpayers millions of dollars, lawmakers did spend a whole hour trying to fix it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, Disney World said it would help its employees sign up for Obamacare. Yeah. Disney World - they're going to help. So, finally Sneezy can get some Claritin, Sleepy can get some adderall, and Grumpy can get some Prozac. They need it, those dwarfs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know how much you guys know about Obamacare, but the way it's supposed to work is that people can choose between several different price plans: bronze, silver, gold, and platinum. But if none of those work for you, President Obama actually introduced a few other plans that are even cheaper. Like, here's a few of them right here, and the coverage you can expect from these. First, we have the cubic zirconium plan. Instead of a detailed mole check, your dermatologist gives you a bottle of sunscreen and offers to 'do' your back. ? Next, is the cement plan. It makes it legal for you to take someone else's medication if they feel like they're done with it. 'I think I'm healthy now. Want these pills? Take it.' After that, there's the wood plan. With that one, the doctor just looks at you and goes, 'eh, probably nothing.' Next, we have the what-evs plan. That's where a cashier at Walgreens guesses what's wrong with you. ? And lastly, there's the cardboard plan. It's just a card with WebMD.com on the front. That'll tell you what's wrong. Some good options.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is day three of the shutdown, and right now 33 percent of the government is doing absolutely nothing. Which is not bad, considering before the shutdown 80 percent wasn't doing anything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apparently, Obamacare does cover carpal tunnel syndrome. The result of pressing a computer trying to get through to stupid Obamacare.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what's interesting, regarding the problems of starting up Obamacare? President Obama...he made this analogy. He said, 'Hey, Apple had some glitches with the iPhone, but then they fixed them.' Technically the President is correct. But you got to remember, Apple has geniuses working there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you, the shutdown is hurting everybody. Today, Michelle Obama told fat kids, 'You're on your own. Eat a damn Happy Meal. I don't care.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Joe Biden accidentally showed the cover of a classified document to the press during a meeting with the Israeli prime minister. The file had 'classified' on it. And they got to see it. See, I never understood that. Why do you put 'classified' or 'top secret' on a file?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The whole mess with the shutdown isn't making anyone happy.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Can you believe that? Nine percent of Americans would give up their citizenship because of all the fighting in DC. You know things are bad when people are getting caught at the Mexican border, and they're being sent back to America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, we put our own survey about the shutdown. The answers were pretty surprising. ... First question was: What is the best solution to the congressional fighting?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today was day nine of the government shutdown. President Obama invited all 232 House Republicans to the White House to discuss the situation.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's what people are talking about. Of course, it's the debt ceiling. Again, we're talking about this, and things aren't going well. In fact, during a press conference yesterday, President Obama said that Congress needs to raise the debt ceiling, because there aren't any other, quote, 'rabbits in our hat.'

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's just so much bickering with these guys. Even the ones on the same side.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today was Day 10 of the government shutdown. At what point do we politely ask Canada to govern us?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;House Republicans offered to raise the debt ceiling for six weeks, but they refused to end the shutdown, which was a nonstarter for President Obama. So, we're at a standstill once again. I will tell you this though: When President Obama and John Boehner finally do settle this, the makeup sex is going to be amazing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the debt ceiling isn't raised by Thursday, the country won't legally be allowed to borrow any more money and will be down to only $30 billion in cash, which China carries that much cash around in their pants. China even issued a warning today. We owe them more than a trillion dollars, like $1.3 trillion, and if we default on that, they've threatened to cut off our supply of cheap, plastic crap made by kids, which would be disastrous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The exclusive gym where congressmen go to work out has remained open during all of this, although they were quick to point out the gym is not fully operational, because towel service is no longer available due to the shutdown. So, everyone is suffering.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new chairman of the Fed is Janet Yellen. ... Janet Yellen is a banking genius. ... You know those pens?you go into a bank?she invented the chain that holds them. Next time you try to steal a pen, think of Janet Yellen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, now the next step is Congress will hold hearings to see if she's qualified. And I thought well, when are we going to hold hearings to see if Congress is qualified?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only 'progress' in Washington today is a website called DrunkDialCongress.org. It's true. It connects Americans who've been drinking - I think the technical term is drinking Americans - to the voicemail of a random congressman. I know. I'm as angry as anyone, but is this a good idea? Is it? Encouraging impaired morons who think the shutdown's some kind of joke to take calls from drunk people?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nancy Pelosi and John Boehner had a closed-door meeting to discuss the government shutdown. No word on how it went, although I did think it was super weird when they put a sock on the doorknob. Actually, people who listened in on this closed door meeting with John Boehner and Nancy Pelosi, they thought they heard a woman crying and then being comforted by Nancy Pelosi.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now the approval rating of Congress has hit a record low of just five percent. There's a lot of pressing questions. Mainly, who's in that five percent that still approves of Congress? ? Actually, when they asked the five percent why they still approve of Congress, they were like, 'Oh, I'm sorry, we thought you said congas.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes, Congress has never been less popular. In fact, this new poll found that Americans have a better opinion of zombies than members of Congress, which is weird, because they're not that different from each other. I mean, take a look. First, we have zombies - they have creepy discolored skin, while Congress has John Boehner. Very orange-like skin. Here, zombies do a lot of moaning, whereas Congress does a lot of postponing. And last, zombies would destroy civilization as we know it. Congress, give it a few more days. There you go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You guys know I love going out to eat, but I don't know about this. I heard about this new restaurant here in New York that doesn't let customers talk to each other during their meals. Yeah. When they heard that, Obama and Republicans were like, 'Table for 200, please.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember the other day when California's health insurance exchange said that over five million people went to their website the first day of Obamacare? Turns out they were off by 4.4 million. Only 645,000 hits it got. Turns out those are from the same guy trying to log on over and over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You got to be careful with the Obamacare - a lot of scams associated with it. ... For example, guys, if you're at the airport, and the TSA agent grabs you and tells you to cough, that is not Obamacare.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of the TSA, they are now easing their policy on people carrying medical marijuana through security checkpoints in the airport. This will be a huge benefit to the 14 million people in L.A. who suffer from glaucoma.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Nobel Prize for chemistry was announced this week. It was awarded to Sen. Ted Cruz for mixing up that batch of Kool-Aid that the Republicans seem to be drinking on Capitol Hill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As for negotiating with the President, John Boehner said, 'I don't want to put anything on the table, and I don't want to take anything off the table.' Of course not. Like most congressmen, they like to do business under the table.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Georgia Republican Congressman Phil Gingrey, I think that's his name. He said it's time for his party to have a 'Braveheart' moment for the American people. Really, a 'Braveheart' moment? This whole government shutdown feels like another Mel Gibson movie: 'Ransom.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congress has an approval rating of five percent. Is that still technically an approval rating? Isn't that really a 95% disapproval rating?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Economists now say if the government spending exceeds the debt ceiling, consumers won't be able to get credit cards with a favorable rate anymore. Oh, yeah. That will take some getting used to, huh? I mean, for so long the credit companies have been spoiling us with those fabulous 30% interest rates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gov. Jerry Brown has signed a bill allowing children in California to have more than two legal parents. Ironically, most kids in California have two illegal parents. So kind of a switch from that.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me ask you a question and you can be honest with me. You can be frank with me. How many of you are only here because you had some trouble signing up for Obamacare, and instead you got tickets to the show?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just want to tell you something from my own personal life. Over the weekend I got on the computer, and I tried to sign up for Obamacare. You hear a lot of people having trouble. Had no trouble whatsoever. Signed right up to Obamacare, and ordered six months of Mexican Viagra.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today is Columbus Day. Finally, a chance for government workers to catch a break and stay home with their families.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, the government may be shut down, but we are wide open. Me in particular. It's hard to believe, I figured this would go on for four or five days. Today was day 14 of the government shutdown. I am starting to forget what it is like to have a government. There is a guy with big ears and a suit that talked about hope. That is all gone. Just when you think that Congress could not do anything less, they manage to. At this point the government is like a house on Halloween that turns out the lights and leaves a bowl of candy on the front porch.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I heard some good news today. If the government ever does default, if we do just completely go belly-up, the festivities - and I think that's the right word - the festivities when the government goes belly-up will be hosted by Tina Fey and Amy Poehler.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When the government defaults we will lose our ability to borrow money. Forget that, we will not be able to borrow money, and also we will lose our membership in Sam's Club.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You remember George W. Bush? We didn't know about this, but he had heart surgery?and they had to clear up a blockage with heart surgery. Maybe we should try that on the Tea Party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what I think we should do? ? If any member of the legislature, a congressman or senator, has served in this particular session, I say we vote them out. ... All of them. Democrats, Republicans, you clearly don't know what you're doing. I'm saying we let Leno do it. Leno is not going to have much to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today's deal caught everyone in Congress by surprise, except Nancy Pelosi. She always looks like that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unfortunately, some underlying issues still remain. Republicans oppose tax increases. Democrats oppose benefit cuts. And John McCain opposes kids on his lawn, because he's old.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama has said the day after the budget deal is made, he's going to concentrate on immigration. He says?he will start by deporting Ted Cruz.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If there had been a debt default tomorrow, a top credit agency said it would have downgraded America's triple-A rating. Downgraded it.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kind of a rough day, today. A friend of mine was given six months by his doctor. Not to live, to sign up for Obamacare. Six months.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't quite understand how the whole Obamacare thing works. Like the other day, I got a flu shot. But it was from a drone. It's like they're combining different elements of the government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President spoke today about it, regarding the Obamacare website glitches. The President says he's bringing in the best and the brightest to solve the problem. Why didn't we bring in the best and brightest in the first place? This is typical Washington. They only bring in the best and the brightest as a last resort. And you know what's going to happen once they bring in the best and the brightest? More American jobs lost to India.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President was very blunt this afternoon. He said there's no sugarcoating the problems with the healthcare website. See, that's a mistake. We're Americans. We love sugar coating. If you sugarcoat something, Americans will buy it. The more sugar the better! Sugar is the reason we have Obamacare in the first place. If it wasn't for sugar, we wouldn't need any of this crap.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie announced he would no longer oppose gay marriage. That's right. Chris Christie said, 'How can I oppose anything that brings more cake into New Jersey?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is urging Americans who are having trouble with the Obamacare website to sign up for healthcare by calling a 1-800 number. Yeah. The number is: 1-800-WE-DIDN'T-THINK-THIS-THROUGH.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes, apparently the healthcare.gov website has 99 problems, but a glitch is all of them. ? The whole point of websites is to design them so that it is nearly impossible to not sign up for something. Every time I go on Amazon there is a 40% chance I will mistakenly overnight myself six seasons of 'Night Court.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, I'm back from my vacation. I had a great time. I spent it screaming obscenities at park rangers.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's see what's going on over in Washington. They're still having a lot of trouble with Obamacare. First, the website is all screwed up. That's got a bunch of glitches. And now people are getting a busy signal when they try to apply over the phone for Obamacare. So you can't use the Internet. And you can't use the phone. And now fax machines are, like, 'Look who's come crawling back to Mr. Fax Machine.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Good news, guys. The country's unemployment rate went down to 7.2 percent last month. That's right. It went down after 148,000 jobs were added. Of course, all those people were hired to fix the Obamacare website. But still, a job is a job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You may have heard about this. A 25-year-old man in New York was arrested for trying to join Al Qaeda. Well, here is the amazing part. He said it was still easier to join Al Qaeda using their website than it was to sign up for Obamacare.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama said yesterday, when it comes to all the problems with the Obamacare website - he said, 'No one is madder than me.' So apparently, he hasn't met any of these Republicans, I guess.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And of course, you know, today...there were more problems with the website. It seems, when you type in your age, it's confusing. Because it's not clear if they want the age you are right now. Or the age you'll be when you finally log in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess they're bringing in a lot of experts. The Obama Administration said today they've asked Verizon to help them fix the website. In fact, Verizon adding a special feature - listen to this - where if you're sick, you will be able to check your life expectancy by how many bars you have left.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's my favorite part. The President said yesterday that if it was taking too long?you can bypass the website and enroll by mail. See, only the Federal government could come up with a website that's slower than sending something by mail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this is pretty dramatic. Yesterday at the White House, a young woman standing behind the President nearly passed out while Obama was speaking. Did you see that? Did you see that? Well, the President turned and grabbed her, held her while she got some help. See, that's under the good coverage of Obamacare. See that's?where you're actually being taken care of personally by Obama. See, that's the platinum package. ? If she had just had the bronze package, then Joe Biden would have just given her a Wet-Nap.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obamacare having a hard time. Colorado's Obamacare website is trying to sell Obamacare to college kids by calling it 'Bro-surance.' Unfortunately, the website wasn't working today because it was 'bro-broken.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some pundits are comparing President Obama pushing Obamacare to a late-night pitchman on an infomercial. Obama said, 'That's not true, but don't take my word for it. Just ask some of these satisfied customers.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Popularity of Congress at all-time low. According to recent poll - I'm not making this up - Americans like head lice more than they like Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Millions of Americans can't get health insurance. The Obamacare website is a disaster, and I am loving it! This techno-turd taco will be Barack Obama's true legacy.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, I'm not surprised it ain't working. This website relies on separately designed databases and software from 55 different contractors. Getting that many people to work together is like herding cats.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone is talking about the Obamacare website. Apparently, this thing has got all of these glitches, and now tech experts are saying the only way to fix it is to completely start over and redesign the whole website from scratch. While the guys from the Geek Squad said, 'Did you try blowing on it? Did you turn it off and wait five seconds and plug it back in? Oh, my God. I make $7 an hour, okay? I call myself a geek.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nobody likes this thing. In fact, only 12 percent of Americans think the roll-out of Obamacare is going well. While 100 percent of Republicans think the roll-out of Obamacare is going great.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House has fired one of its national security officials for setting up an anonymous Twitter account that was leaking internal information. President Obama called the invasion of privacy unacceptable, while Americans called it karma.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's the latest on Obama-crash. I mean, Obamacare, the website. The Obama Administration has now asked Verizon to help fix the Obamacare website. Now, Verizon wasn't the President's first choice. He initially reached out to T-Mobile, but they dropped the call. So, then he went to Verizon after that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Consumer Reports' is now recommending people sit back and wait a few weeks until the government fixes the problem. Really, a few weeks? When was the last time the government fixed anything in a few weeks? We still have troops in Korea. Okay. Really, a few weeks?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US Capitol dome - you know the dome? It's going to undergo extensive repairs. Over 1,000 cracks in it. They're going to spend $59.6 million to fix cracks and other problems on the outside of the Capitol building. Hey, how about we fix the problems inside the capitol building? Start there, and then work your way up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Finally, some good news for President Obama. About time he had good news. Despite all of the website problems, the approval rating for Obamacare has gone up. That's a true fact, yeah. Unfortunately, I can't give you the exact number, because it's listed on the Obamacare website.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is weird. Somebody in the White House used a fake Twitter account to send out hundreds of anti-Obama tweets. ... The account was immediately shut down, and Malia has been grounded.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are still having trouble signing up for Obamacare because the website is totally screwed up. And the White House isn't happy about it either.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even with everything going on with Obamacare, the President still has stuff to do.

Well, Biden says, 'Hello, I'm not supposed to talk.'&quot; Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As I'm sure you know, this Obama-crash - Obamacare website not working out too well.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Well, they are making progress. Like they said today, if you find yourself getting too frustrated trying to log on, they've added a link to a suicide hotline. I think that will help.&quot; Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what the President should do? Put the NSA in charge of the website. That way there's nothing to fill out. They already have all our information.&quot; Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Saudi Arabia now threatening to sever diplomatic ties with the United States over Syria. Hope that doesn't cause them to do something drastic. You know, like overcharge us for oil.&quot; Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain now hinting that he may run for reelection to the Senate in 2016 when he is 80-years-old. Hey, why not? I mean, why should he settle for sitting at home playing bingo and shuffleboard when he could be sitting in the Senate playing video poker on his iPhone?&quot; Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From the world of politics, there's been a lot of speculation but now it's clear that Joe Biden will run for president in 2016. That's true. They're saying he's going to run, yeah. In an effort to appear presidential, today Biden launched a website that doesn't work. That's what president's do.&quot; Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of the Obamacare website?One of the contractors who built the Obamacare website testified before Congress today. You can tell he built the site because any time they would ask a question, he would freeze.&quot; Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know Europeans are really angry with us for spying on them. The nerve of those guys. Here's the latest. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the US would have to regain her trust after the NSA eavesdropped on her cell phone.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually this is true, German Chancellor Angela Merkel she is angry at the US and this is a quote: 'Spying among friends cannot be.' Then she introduced her chief speech writer, Yoda.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is just crazy. Another scandal with the National Security Agency, the NSA. They are at it again. More stuff keeps coming out. You know they have been accused of spying on Americans. Well, it just came out that they actually spied on 35 world leaders. Yeah. It was 34 prime ministers and Oprah.&quot; Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some more news out of Washington. All good news, of course. This time it is about the IRS. A new report found that 700 IRS employees owed a combined $5.4 million in back taxes. When IRS workers got the news, they were like, 'Oh, man, I hope I don't find out about this.'&quot; Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My man John McCain was in the news this week. He said that he's seriously thinking about running for a sixth term in 2016. In addition to that, the other thing he's seriously thinking about, stewed prunes.&quot; Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here is some amazing technology. NASA has successfully tested a broadband communications system that's built into the lunar atmosphere explorer probe. And it's sending data to and from the moon at the rate of 622 megabytes per second. To the moon and back in a second. In a related story, the Obamacare website is still down. Yeah, we can't get that going. But we're getting to the moon and back.&quot; Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I tried to log on to the Obamacare website today. I don't think I'm doing it right. I lost $300 playing Texas Hold 'em. That's not right.&quot; Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Washington, D.C. police are now investigating a burglary at the home of Secretary of State John Kerry. Somebody broke into his house.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm playing fantasy health insurance. I draft a team of doctors, pretend I've signed up for Obamacare. It's a lot of fun.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a report, more than 700 fake Obamacare websites have been created. Security experts say it's simple to identify the phony websites because they are easy to log on to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House said today that one of the reasons the Obamacare website has had so many problems - it's so popular, it was overwhelmed. Really? How come PSY's 'Gangnam Style' video never had any problems? Really, so Obamacare is more popular than that? I don't think so.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House now says that the website should be functioning smoothly by the end of November. By the end of November. This means, of course, the beginning of April. ... Have you tried to log on? Oh, it's slow. ... It's slower than Chris Christie trying to put on a pair of bicycle shorts. ? It's so slow that by the time it's operational, Al Gore will be complaining about global cooling. ... It has crashed so many times, they renamed it Amtrak.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The NSA website went offline Friday after suspected hackers broke into it. They got into the NSA website. So NSA, not so much fun when people are sneaking into your computer, is it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the Spanish press, the NSA monitored over 60 million Spanish phone calls in one month. And that was just here in LA okay? That's not even counting Spain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many of our allies are very upset over this NSA spying scandal. The official word from the White House is that President Obama didn't know the NSA was tapping the phones of 35 world leaders. Obama said he didn't know about this spying, because he is too busy not knowing about the problems with the Obamacare website.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm just too mad about Obamacare, folks. You see, the rollout has been one disaster after the next. Actually, you can't even get to the next disaster, you get an error page that says, '404: Disaster not found.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;German Chancellor Angela Merkel is furious the NSA tapped her private cell phone. And yesterday, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney announced that the White House did not use its surveillance of foreign governments for any economic purposes. Or any economic gain. And maybe it should have. We would have learned something about running an economy properly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of things going on in this country right now. This is really a time for self-examination for all Americans. We have to learn to examine ourselves. You know why? 'Cause it doesn't look like we'll get any decent healthcare.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, despite the fact that for years, President Obama has been saying that no one would lose their healthcare plan, now the White House has admitted, in fact, that many, many people will lose their plans. But there is a way to keep the great coverage you have. Just become a member of Congress. Then the taxpayers pay for the whole thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But there was some good news today for the Health and Human Services Secretary, Kathleen Sebelius. Obamacare will cover all her injuries after the White House throws her under the bus. She's fully covered.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not looking good. Remember the old days when President Obama's worst embarrassment was Joe Biden? Remember those days? What happened there? Have you tried to go on the healthcare site? Oh, it is slow. It is so slow, by the time you sign up for Obamacare, you're eligible for Medicare. That's how slow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Washington, DC, City Council is holding hearings on decriminalizing marijuana. You thought Washington was slow getting stuff done before. Wait until they legalize marijuana, okay? It will be unbelievable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier this week, hackers from Syria targeted President Obama's Twitter and Facebook accounts. Which got even weirder when Obama hired them to fix the Obamacare website.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It has been five years since America was driven to financial ruin by, well, who can remember? All right. Let's just say it was Obama. ? The point is, it wasn't the banks. Now, a lot of people lost their savings and have had to pay for their retirement with things like reverse mortgages, where in exchange for cash now, Fred Thompson gets your home when you die. And as far as I am aware, he is not legally allowed to kill you to get it sooner. Thank you, Elizabeth Warren. So, times are tough, it is true, but now we have bounced back, if by 'we,' I don't mean you, and generally, I don't. Because since 2009, 95% of income gains have gone to the top one percent. So, that is just wrong. The 1% should get 99%. That adds up to 100. Where is the missing 4%? I bet the poor took it - you know they steal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US is denying that we've been spying on our allies. But the Germans aren't buying it. ? They are very angry, the Germans. They're threatening to return David Hasselhoff. You can tell President Obama is getting tired of talking about this scandal. Because today he said, 'Anyone want to talk about my birth certificate?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He [Obama] is also being criticized for the Obamacare website. You know what's wrong with that website? A lot of the people trying to sign up for Obamacare are elderly. So, you've already lost them at 'website.' Here's what I don't understand. Our government is smart enough to spy on us through phones and the Internet. But they can't put up a website? Why don't we take the people who do the spying and put them to work for Obamacare? Bam! Problem solved.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody tried to sign up for the Obamacare? You guys have any luck signing up? It's impossible.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I like giving you good news, but I'm afraid it's sad to say this Congress right now is the least popular of all time. Just thinking about what's going on on Capitol Hill makes people nauseous. Nausea, by the way, more popular than Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Republicans in Congress are the most-least popular. One reason is that they disappointed their base by voting to raise the debt ceiling on the flimsy excuse of avoiding a galactic economic meltdown. Well, yesterday Senate Republicans did their best to fix that mistake when 27 GOP Senators voted to disapprove of their previous votes to raise the debt ceiling. I believe the motion was titled 'SR-346, Fiscal-I-Call-Backsies.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, folks, it was not easy for them to get this vote. Mitch McConnell had to negotiate with Harry Reid so that the recent debt-ceiling bill included a provision that there would be a second vote expressing approval or disapproval of the first vote. In short, GOP Senators voted for raising the debt ceiling on the stipulation they could vote against having voted for it. Proving that Republicans may not be bipartisan, but they may be bipolar.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, there are many consequences to this growing cascade of revelations about our nation's spying activities. Most recently, the bugging of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone and lederhosen drawers, and the fact that the United States pretended to be her online boyfriend for two years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are already talking about the next presidential race, which is still a few years away. In fact, a new poll found that 48 percent of New Jersey wants Chris Christie to run for president in 2016. Which isn't surprising, since Christie actually makes up 48 percent of New Jersey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, it's really trick-or-treat time at the White House. President Obama tricked us into thinking we'd be able to afford treatment. You see, it was 'trick or treatment.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, now the Federal Trade Commission reports that con-artists are using confusion over Obamacare to sign people up?for what they call fake health insurance. The scammers lure victims with false promises. Stuff like, 'If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan.' See, they'll tell you that. The scammers will tell you that, but you have to be careful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, now, a lot of people are accusing the President of being less than truthful. In fact, a couple weeks ago, President Obama called me and told me personally, 'If I like my current job, I can keep my current job.' And I believed him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to the L.A. Times, regarding the promises made about Obamacare, some officials privately said...they privately wish they'd had left more wiggle room. Wiggle room. See, only in politics is the truth considered wiggle room.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if you saw the hearings today - three different members of Congress compared Obamacare to the Wizard of Oz. Actually, Congress is like the Wizard of Oz. The Republicans have no heart. The Democrats have no courage. And the people who are on the Obamacare website have no brains.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this Obamacare website, boy, has been nothing but problems, hasn't it? Oh, my God. You don't know how difficult it is to log on. Today, Edward Snowden said even he couldn't get in. He said, 'That's it, I'm through.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, of course, the other big scandal. This NSA spying thing. This is another huge scandal. In fact, today, the White House announced President Obama is changing his slogan from 'Change you can believe in' to 'I know nothing!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President said he didn't know we were spying on our allies, didn't know about the problems with the healthcare website. Have you heard the latest? Now the President claims he doesn't know how 'Breaking Bad' ended.&quot;</SPAN></P>

At a recent Republican Party meeting, Wheeler explained how he had responded to a critic who accused him of being too weak - that if his constituents wanted him to, he would vote for slavery. That's right, when we voters elect someone, we become his master and he must do what we say under the threat of violence. There's only one word for that, democracy. And this promise makes a hell of a bumper sticker, 'Jim Wheeler. You want slaves? You got them!'&quot;</SPAN></P>

Of those six that signed up, four have already died of old age. So, there's only two left. Well, this is my favorite part. Hand to God - this is the absolute truth.

Everyone is getting screwed by the website, but the true victim of this healthcare disaster are America's most vulnerable - the men. When it comes to medical care, men always get the short end of the long end of the scope. You see, folks, up until now, health insurance in America has always struck a delicate balance. Women paid higher premiums than men, and in return, men paid less. The system worked. But now, folks, all that's changing. Obamacare will have men and women paying the same amount for healthcare, but since women live longer, and have babies, shouldn't they pay more?&quot;</SPAN></P>

And Toronto Mayor Rob Ford's approval rating went up to 49%. How does this make Obama feel? He's better off smoking crack than passing Obamacare. He would have been up 10 points.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, have you noticed the President backtracking a little bit on this whole deal? Like at a fund-raiser earlier this week, President Obama said, 'No, no, no.' What he promised was, you could keep your healthcare plan if it hasn't changed since the law has passed. You know, he's such a good speaker, he almost believed it himself. And then his pants caught fire. That's when I knew.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, I don't know if it is an honor. He appeared on the cover of the new 'Time' magazine.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;[Referring to the New York City mayoral election] Yes, 22 percent of registered voters of New York City voted for the mayor. Twenty-two percent. I'll tell you why. It's more fun to vote if your mayor's on crack.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier this week, Joe Biden - what a nice guy - called Boston's Mayor-elect, Marty Walsh, to congratulate him on winning. But it turns out he called the wrong Marty Walsh. He called a dude named Marty Walsh who lives in Boston. But in Biden's defense, it's pretty hard to find a guy in Boston who isn't named Marty Walsh. It's like, 'Hey, you Marty Walsh? I'm Marty Walsh. Yeah, I work with your brother Marty Walsh.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I was thinking about Thanksgiving today, and I realized that's who we should put in charge of the Obamacare website. The Butterball Hotline people.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House webpage still says - it still says this: 'If you like your healthcare plan, you can keep it.' Well, we know that's not true. But, the White House said today they're trying to change it, they just can't log on.&quot;</SPAN></P>

This is a real issue. No, that's the real issue. You know, people think, 'Oh, it's kind of a jab.' But, in their defense, I think they chose the least offensive title. Here's the other ones they had. Take a look. 'Chris Christie Having a Whale of a Time.' I didn't like that one. Then they have, 'Between a Rock and a Lard Place.' Yeah, that's not good. And 'Hail to the Chef.' Yeah, I don't think any of those?were appropriate.&quot;</SPAN></P>

We check every episode, and if we find a fact, we replace it with the truth. Unfortunately, folks, not all news organizations out there are up to our standards. There is a scandal tearing apart CBS News, home of Edward R. Murrow, Walter Cronkite, and Julie Chen. You see, two weeks ago, CBS News' the '60 Minutes' took time off from doing in-depth buddy curls with Wolverine to blow the lid off Benghazi-gate. When the attacks in Libya occurred, '60 Minutes' was on the scene within minutes of 13 months later.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you want to see some real magic, though, look no further than Toronto Mayor Rob Ford. Rob Ford, he's provided me with so much entertainment this week I feel like I should pay him a subscription fee like HBO.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As if the crack-smoking wasn't enough, yesterday a police report came out. It was all manners of allegations, including a prostitute, cocaine, sexual harassment. Rob Ford is like your drunk uncle that is fun, but you're just getting old enough to realize why your parents never let him take you anywhere by himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here in New York City, we have a new mayor. Are you aware of that? His name is Rick De Blasio. He's six feet, seven inches tall, and his wife is a former lesbian. She is a former lesbian, although she can be called back to active duty on a moment's notice. And yes, she said that's her former life. She's no longer a lesbian. She even turned in her Subaru Forester. And not to be confused with current Mayor Bloomberg, the outgoing mayor. Not to be confused with him. He's a former leprechaun.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is official. Toronto Mayor Rob Ford is officially the best. He is the best. This guy is unbelievable. The Mayor of Toronto, now he has admitted that he bought crack. And now he may be forced to take a leave of absence. Which raises the question, 'What the hell does he have to do to get fired?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After he admitted to buying crack while in office, Rob Ford said yesterday that he sees himself as, quote, 'a positive role model for kids.' ? Critics like, are like, 'How can you be on drugs and inspire kids?' Then the makers of 'Yo Gabba Gabba' said, 'It's actually easier than you think.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, President Obama had a press conference where he said that he fumbled the roll-out of Obamacare. But the good news is, he just got signed to play running back for the Oakland Raiders.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obamacare has been nothing but trouble here. In fact, the Department of Homeland Security revealed that hackers have attempted more than a dozen cyber attacks on the Obamacare website, but couldn't get in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, House Speaker John Boehner said that the Senate's immigration bill is so long that nobody has even read it - that's nice. It is always good to hear?the Senate is taking the same approach on legislation that I take with the iTunes user agreement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to a new poll out this week, 52 percent of Americans describe President Obama as not honest. Fifty-two percent believe he's not honest. Do you realize that makes him by far the most honest politician in American history? So, that's pretty impressive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, a lot of Democrats now starting to distance themselves from Obamacare. Earlier this week, Bill Clinton made some critical comments, and today, Harry Reid got a letter from his mortician telling him his coverage had been canceled. No more embalming fluid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, at a press conference earlier today, President Obama talked about HealthCare.gov, and he said buying health insurance is never going to be as easy as buying a song on iTunes. Well, the answer is simple. Fire the website people and hire the people from iTunes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And instead of giving a rebuttal after President Obama's speech, House Speaker John Boehner gave a pre-buttal before the speech. A pre-buttal. Doesn't that sound like a procedure that should be covered under Obamacare?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Sarah Palin is speaking out about President Obama. ? She said she honestly can't think of one policy that's working. See, I think Sarah Palin is half right. The part where she says, 'I honestly can't think.' I think she actually has that part down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, President Obama met at the White House with leaders of various American Indian tribes. The President promised to help tackle the challenges facing Native American communities, like card-counting. That's a huge problem. Well, the Native Americans are very upset, because you know, this country used to belong to them. Of course, now it belongs to the Chinese, so they are furious.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, I don't know if you saw this. Today, President Obama admitted that the healthcare roll-out was a fiasco. He blamed himself and he said, quote, 'I'm not a perfect president.' This explains why Fox News named him their employee of the month.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More fun news about Toronto's crack-smoking mayor. ? It just came out that Toronto Mayor Rob Ford spent St. Patrick's Day snorting cocaine with a prostitute. As an Irish person, I'm offended. St. Patrick's Day is for drinking beer with a prostitute.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The world said goodbye today to one of the greatest men who ever lived, Nelson Mandela. They had his service. And what a life he lived. Amazing. You know, he spent 27 years in prison and then ascended to become president of his country. He went from prison to politics. It was exactly the opposite of how we do it in this country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many world leaders gathering at Nelson Mandela's memorial in South Africa. Many leaders are congregating there to pay their respects. This is one of the gossipy items. Some are saying that while at the memorial, President Obama flirted with the female prime minister of Denmark right in front of Michelle Obama. Yeah, man, if President Obama felt like the flight to South Africa was long, can you imagine the way home? That's going to be incredible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's the real interesting thing that happened at the memorial today. President Obama shook hands with Cuban dictator Raul Castro. ... Or as Fox News reported it, 'Foreign Communist Shakes Hands with the Leader of Cuba.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama's approval rating among 20-somethings has been plummeting, which is why now he's focusing on easing student debts and touring with Macklemore.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This guy, Edward Snowden, he keeps leaking out more leaks,&quot; and now he is &quot;saying that the NSA would actually spy on people while they played the video game 'World of Warcraft.'

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Listen to this, ladies and gentlemen. The Republicans and the Democrats have now agreed on a new budget without delay or bickering. ?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems like the bad news about Obamacare keeps pouring in. Seems like every time I turn on the TV I see me screaming about it, and frankly, I can't blame me. I mean, first the website was broken. Then it was fixed. And now a million people have signed up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;...I made my own anti-Obamacare song parodies. Order today for Steven Colbert's 'Now That's What I Call Christmas Healthcare Parodies: Volume 1.' Okay. Give it to a friend and they'll enjoy Christmas classics like, 'Hark the herald Kathleen Sebelius sing, glory to Obamacare.' And, 'Obamacare is beginning to look a lot like socialism. Every hospital to which you go.' Plus, 'Feliz death panel. Feliz death panel. Feliz death panel?Obamacare.' And no collection would be complete without, 'Away in a healthcare manager, he said if you like your healthcare plan you could keep it. Obamacare made our little Lord Jesus cry.' And for the kids out there, 'Frosty the Biden.' And the whole family will sing along with, 'O Obamacare.' Act now, and you'll also get 'Jingle Obamacare Dogs.' A bunch of lovable, fiscally-conservative pups barking your favorite Christmas anti-Obamacare songs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Referring to new budget deal] &quot;We'll pick up where we left off last night with the United States Congress. If you tuned in, you might have seen this - how this, the 113th Congress, is perhaps the worst Congress in the history of not just this nation. So, we thought we would check in on what today's congressional [bleep] was doing. What do they do today? Pass a resolution demanding pre-approval of all presidential handshakes? Refuse to vote on anything, except whether to add cronuts to the congressional brunch. Sitting around saying that Saxby Chambliss is an acceptable name. It's not. It's not okay. It's just not okay. ? Deal? Deal? What type of witchcraft is this? Deal? The elders have spoken of such wonders, but I thought, like the yeti, it belonged to legend. If this be true, it be incredible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been another tough week for President Obama. ? Did you see this? Yesterday at Nelson Mandela's memorial service, two things. One, is he came under fire when he shook hands with Cuba's communist leader Raul Castro. People are like, 'Why would you want to be seen with that guy.' And then Castro was like, 'I didn't, but all of a sudden he was shaking my hand. I didn't know what to do. What was I going to do, say no? He just came up and I shook his hand.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Obama's also facing criticism after he posed for a selfie right in the middle of Mandela's memorial service. ? There he's taking the picture of himself with the prime ministers of England and Denmark. You know it's bad when even Biden was like, 'Man that was dumb. That was real dumb.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And did you see Michelle while this is happening? Look at this. She did not look happy. Looks like somebody's going to be sleeping by him-selfie for a while. That's what I think.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It looks like the United States is trying to forge a new relationship with Iran. But the Iranians are leery. They want to make sure Ben Affleck is not involved in any way. 'We got burned by that guy once before.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you seen the picture going around [of] the President taking a selfie with the female Prime Minister of Denmark? Here's the picture. And Michelle doesn't look happy, does she? Look at the President. He's having the time of his life and she is just staring straight ahead. Well, people are now saying it was taken out of context and she's not mad at all. But I don't know. Like, this morning at the White House, Michelle gave the President burnt toast and she said, 'Oh, sorry for the burnt toast. Were you hoping for a little Danish?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Congressman Alan Grayson from Florida has acknowledged that he lost $18 million in a stock scheme. You've got to admit, doesn't that make you feel good to see a congressman losing his own money for a change?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has had a bad couple of days. He's embroiled in a major scandal involving lane closures near the George Washington Bridge. One of his top aides allegedly ordered the lane closure to retaliate against the mayor of Fort Lee, who refused to support Governor Christie's re-election. A lot of people got stuck in terrible traffic. Ambulances had a hard time getting through. Blocking off bridges, you know, intentionally. To put that in perspective, that's what Bane did in the last Batman movie. It's a big deal. ? The scandal could damage Christie's chances of getting the Republican nomination for president in 2016, but he'll probably bounce back. He seems like a pretty bouncy person.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey, apparently some goons in his office closed the George Washington Bridge as a prank. And they have the emails to prove it. Now, this is what I don't understand. You got a major political figure. You have the busiest bridge in the world. Don't put anything in writing. ? Do what I always do when I have something top secret to discuss. I go to the bowling alley and use the pay phone.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Christie is saying he knew nothing about it. It was all his aides. He had no knowledge of the closing of the bridge. He is trying to distance himself from the scandal. And this is a big guy. You want to distance yourself from something when you're that big, you got to go to Mars.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been a lousy week for Governor Christie. I mean, first the bridge scandal and now the nationwide Velveeta shortage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Governor Christie's office is accused of shutting down a bridge to get back at a mayor who won't endorse him. It's all very petty, but shutting down the bridge caused four-hour delays. Or as it's known in Los Angeles, 'three blocks at rush hour.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone's talking about Chris Christie today. He's a Republican, so MSNBC says, 'He's guilty.' Fox News says, 'Give him a chance.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government is cracking down on companies that say they can help you lose weight. The Obama Administration accused four weight-loss companies of misleading Americans about their health benefits. And the companies said, 'Couldn't we say the same about you?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Referring to Christie scandal) &quot;Bottom line, bottom line, no one can definitively prove the original order came from Chris Christie. But I would like to go on the record as saying, God, I hope it did. Because a year ago when I saw him palling around with Barack Obama after Hurricane Sandy, I was worried he was one of those fake conservatives who secretly believes that the government can do things. But now I realize he's the kind of leader I can get behind. The kind who says it's my way or I shut down your highway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Christie is a true conservative. He is committed to proving the core conservative value that government is the problem, even if he has to create those problems himself. I can already see his 2016 bumper sticker: 'Christie. Bringing America Together Or I Will [bleep] You Over.' Best of all, his team will make sure you have plenty of time to read those bumper stickers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Referring to Robert Gates' memoir) &quot;Secretary Gates writes&quot; of &quot;the President's Afghanistan strategy, 'I believe Obama was right in his decisions, but I myself, our commanders and our troops, had expected more commitment to the cause and more passion for it from him.' Yes, Obama made the right decisions, but he faked his war-gasm. Secretary Gates much preferred President Bush, who 'had no second thoughts about Iraq, including our decision to invade.' No second thoughts. I'm pretty sure he didn't have first thoughts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you may have heard, New Jersey Republican, I believe his name is Christopher Christie, faced an outcry yesterday after it was revealed his staffers purposely tied up traffic for days at the Fort Lee, New Jersey, side of the George Washington Bridge as payback against the town's Democratic mayor, because, apparently, being right there at the bridge isn't punishment enough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is dealing with a scandal after it was revealed that a top aide shut down access to the George Washington Bridge to get back at a Democratic mayor for not endorsing him. Christie was furious when they blocked the bridge, because he thought they said they were blocking the fridge. He was like, 'What?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, though, Chris Christie held a press conference today to address the bridge scandal, where he insisted that he is not a bully. And he will sit on anyone who says otherwise.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, President Obama announced a new plan to create things called 'promise zones' in parts of the country where the economy still needs help. 'Promise zones'? Sounds less like an economic plan, more like something your parents would say during the sex talk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Obama gave photographers a rare chance to take pictures of his weekly lunch with Joe Biden. Then Biden told his friends, 'Told you I knew the President.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this has turned into a huge scandal. Apparently somebody in Governor Christie's office, as you know, was involved in that traffic-lane closure at the George Washington Bridge that?caused a huge traffic jam. And the allegation is, it was done in retaliation against the mayor of Fort Lee for not supporting Christie's re-election campaign. But Christie is denying any personal involvement. He said he was too busy clogging his own arteries at the time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pundits are saying this could hurt his 2016 presidential campaign. The ironic thing is, now that Christie is denying everything, he sounds even more presidential, doesn't he?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, after his denial, Christie quickly left the news conference to deal with a more personal crisis, the Velveeta cheese shortage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in the new movie 'The Wolf of Wall Street,' they say the 'F' word was used a record 506 times, thus breaking the old record of 505 times, set by President Obama when he heard about Robert Gates' new book.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Vote Democrat.' Besides, besides, people should be chained by their need for insurance to jobs they hate. That is what built this country. You think anyone wanted to be a Pilgrim? No!

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You see, for years the President has been dragging his feet on...the Keystone XL pipeline, which would drastically increase our nation's supply of oil, as well as our nation's supply of pipe. Now, for a while Obama insisted he couldn't complete the project, because the nation's best pipe-fitters were busy saving Princess Peach. Then, he claimed he couldn't approve anything until he got the environmental-impact report. Well, last week his strategic-excuse reserve ran dry.&quot; [Referring to the findings in the environmental-impact report] &quot;Bottom line, the pipeline will provide us with much needed fossil fuels.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;?The President's own study says the environmental impact is negligible, 'because most of Alberta's oil will find a way to get to market anyway - if not by pipeline, then by rail.' It's inevitable, and if something is inevitable, then America should be the one to do it. ? Case in point, it's inevitable that climate change is going to melt the ice caps. So, I say we drown the polar bears in the San Diego Zoo. We just charge people a couple hundred bucks a head to watch. Then, you give the money to the World Wildlife Fund and they can use it to save the polar bears, because otherwise, those guys are doomed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
