<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, I am so glad, I am so glad to hear that you are happy, because I used to be happy. But I learned something today that shook me to my core. And once my core is shaken, don't come a knocking. Here's the deal. Remember that one time I mentioned in passing that Obama is plotting to radically alter the founder's vision for America? He is. Ben Franklin would be horrified by Obamacare. It doesn't even cover leech-craft or bone-purging for female hysteria.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But folks, what is most insidious about Obama's agenda is how it's now brainwashing our children. Take Michelle Obama's 'Let's Move' campaign to combat childhood obesity. [Video of Kim Jong-Un appears] Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. No, that's North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un. It's so easy to mistake the two. They both look great in pant suits.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Referring to recent childhood obesity report] Childhood obesity rates have dropped &quot;over 40 percent in a decade. Nation, I believe the children are the future. And thanks to Mrs. Obama, America now has 40 percent less tomorrow. That's just math.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't understand a First Lady accomplishing something. Everything they do is supposed to be a symbolic waste of time. Like Nancy Reagan's war on drugs or Laura Bush's fight to end presidential illiteracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thanks to Mrs. Obama, instead of care-free chubsters, we are now...breeding a generation of body-conscious tots doing tricycle spin classes desperately trying to get back to their birth weight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Worst of all, this is bad news for the GOP. They need to reach out to the preschool demo. And it won't be easy, since the Republicans are on record as trying to deport Dora and they condemn SpongeBob as a form of birth control. Plus, preschool itself is a left-wing, socialist training camp. Sharing toys, snack handouts, premarital napping, not to mention wasteful infrastructure projects.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ralph Nader is now calling on super-rich people like Oprah to run for president. Yeah, President Oprah. A lot of people say this is an interesting idea, while Hillary calls it 'that dream where I wake up screaming. That's not real, right? That's not real? Oh, my God. Please don't tell me that's real.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seth Meyers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the next presidential election is still two years off, but speculation is already underway. A 'New York Times' poll says that eight out of ten Democrats want Hillary Clinton to run for president in 2016. The same poll also shows that ten out of ten Democrats want Chris Christie to run against her.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seth Meyers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama has announced that four million people have signed up for Obamacare. Obama said he wants to hit seven million users by the end of March, at which point he'll sell it to Facebook for $10 billion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seth Meyers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Arizona state legislature passed a law that made it legal for businesses to deny service to gay customers. And Tucker Carlson told Fox News this week, 'If I want to bake you a cake for your gay wedding, that's called tolerance. But when you try and force me to bake a cake for your gay wedding, and threaten me with prison if I don't, that's called fascism.' I think the more important issue is, who is asking Tucker Carlson to bake all these wedding cakes?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Referring to a Federal judge overturning the Texas ban on gay marriage] &quot;Texas State Senator Dan Patrick did not celebrate that ruling. He's running for lieutenant governor. He's a very vocal opponent of same-sex marriage. But this is what he tweeted yesterday. He tweeted, 'Marriage equals one man and one man. Enough of these activist judges. Favorite it if you agree. I know the silent majority is out there with us.' Not great with math, but I'm pretty sure that one man and one man, that's two men, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I'm sorry, apparently all straight people are now legally required to make wedding cakes for gay people, because last night, Arizona governor and diner waitress working a 60-hour shift, Jan Brewer, vetoed SB-1062, a bill protecting my religious right to deny Sodomites pastry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Referring to a Stanford professor's study on the US Bureau of Labor Statistics' National Longitudinal Survey of Youth] &quot;It...tracked young people over 19 years to see how their lives had changed, and one of the researchers, Stanford sociologist Aliya Saperstein, found something truly shocking.&quot; Unidentified Speaker: &quot;Saperstein found that the racial classification of people in the survey seemed to change over time.&quot; Colbert: &quot;Yes, your race can change over time.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seth Meyers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This situation in the Ukraine is still a very big story. You know, they overthrew their government. And then their president, Viktor Yanukovych, he went on the run. He's hanging out somewhere, partying. And there are reports now that Russia has granted protection to Yanukovych. When Edward Snowden heard that, he was like, 'Top bunk!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seth Meyers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is very controversial. Yesterday, a Federal judge overturned the ban on gay marriage in Texas. ? Of course, a lot of people disagreed with this. In fact, one state senator, his name's Dan Patrick, got so mad he went on Twitter just to make his case against gay marriage. ? I guess he was so upset that he accidentally tweeted that marriage should be between one man and one man. His name is Dan Patrick. Even his name is one man plus one man. Dan Patrick.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, the world is still focused on the ongoing conflict in the Ukraine. And over the weekend, Sarah Palin reminded everyone that during the 2008 election, she predicted Russia would invade the Ukraine.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And get this - Secretary of State John Kerry went on 'Meet the Press' yesterday, and actually criticized Russia for its action in the Ukraine. He said, quote, 'You don't just invade another country on phony pretext in order to assert your interest.' Then he said, 'I mean, we stopped doing that, like, months ago. Okay?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And while all of this is going on [Russian troops entering Ukraine], President Obama is staying very busy. That's right. On Friday, President Obama took a selfie with Bill Nye the Science Guy and astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, the Russians are at it again. Over the weekend, they - you know, the Olympics are done, they have nothing to do - so they invade Crimea. And so President Obama is steamed. And he says to Putin, he said, 'Look, pull your troops out of Crimea or the US will not attend the next G-8 summit.' And I said, 'Well that will show him. By God, that will teach him. Wait a minute. Putin will think twice about it now. Last thing he wants to do is offend the United States so they stay home from a summit meeting.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House revealed that more than five million people have now signed up for Obamacare. Yeah, thanks to the Administration's recent push, five million.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seth Meyers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The situation in Ukraine continues to develop. Vladimir Putin signed a treaty this morning that formally absorbs Crimea into the Russian Federation. So if you felt bad because you didn't know where Crimea was, don't worry, it's gone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seth Meyers:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's what everyone is talking about. Of course, it's the standoff in Ukraine. It seems like it just keeps getting worse, and now listen to this. There's a new poll that shows that Vladimir Putin's approval rating has actually gone up 10 percent since he's sent troops into Crimea.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, let's look at the rest of Obama's bracket. He picked Florida, Arizona, Michigan State and Louisville to make the Final Four.

Here's another tweet. 'Somebody should start a Tinder, but just for friends. #notkidding. #idswiperight.' That's a good idea actually. Then he tweeted, 'Just peed in all 35 bathrooms. #dehydrated.'

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's get to some news here and talk about what people are talking about. Things are still very tense between the US and Russia over the situation in Ukraine. And get this, intelligence officials are now saying that they had a hard time predicting Russia's invasion, because Vladimir Putin doesn't own a cell phone or use the Internet. I guess he doesn't want to be tracked. But you can tell Putin doesn't spend much time online, because when he sends, 'lol,' he means, 'Look out, Latvia.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Putin apparently doesn't use the Internet because he is afraid of being tracked by foreign governments and 'cause any time he needs to know something, he can just ask Edward Snowden.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, President Obama is still very concerned about what is happening in Ukraine and, during a speech today in Belgium, Obama called for a united front with Europe against Russia.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, Belgium wanted to give the US Embassy in Brussels a gift. They want to give a gift to commemorate Obama's visit. This is real. This is a gift. They decided on a life-size cookie of President Obama wearing a USA sweatshirt and holding a basketball. France gives us the Statue of Liberty. Belgium gives us that. It got even weirder when Biden spent a half hour talking to it. He's like, 'You seem quiet today. Everything all right?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seth Meyers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the Obama Administration has given Americans another month to sign up for Obamacare as long as they check a box on the website saying they tried to sign up before the original launch.

There's investigations, there's subpoenas, and he says, 'I'll handle this. I'm going to investigate myself.' So, he investigates himself. He finds out that he, in fact, is innocent.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, nation, everybody knows I'm a huge fan of the five conservative Justices on the Supreme Court. They're like a judicial version of 'One Direction' in that all their rulings go in one direction.

Ryan called Obama immature, while Chris Christie called to see if they had any more of those 'stink-burgers' or 'mean-wiches.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Putin is out there dating again, and you can tell he's single because he's already working on his pickup lines. First, there's, 'Do your legs hurt? Because you've been running from my military all night.' Next we have, 'Is your father a baker? Because I would wait in breadline for three days for you.' And then here's the last one, 'Are you an angel? Because I thought I had you killed months ago.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

She had a mastery of the facts and an unshakable confidence, all while wearing those stupid glasses. I mean, they're like - these things are like orthopedic shoes for your face.

Has Karl Rove lost track of time because he has a serious brain injury? I'm just asking the question.

And I'm no political expert and no pundit or figure, but she has a new book out of her experiences as Secretary of State, and instead of a book jacket, you know when they put a book jacket on a book, hers is wearing a pantsuit. Hillary said, as she's giving away a little hint. She said her staff is now doing internal polling. I thought, 'Oh my God, no. That's what got her husband in trouble, come on, no. Please.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, the mid-terms are rapidly approaching, and things look good for Republicans across the board, with one glaring exception. The GOP continues to struggle with Hispanic voters. For some reason, they're not rallying to the GOP's message of 'Look, Marco Rubio!' ... But a new strategy has been pioneered by Arizona Republican Scott Fistler, seen here photobombing a picture of a map after losing two races in a heavily Hispanic community. He's found a way to get his name out there: Get another name out there.&quot; Reporter: &quot;Scott Fistler has legally changed his name to Cesar Chavez.&quot; Colbert: &quot;Adios, Scott Fistler. Hola, Cesar Chavez. You know what they say, if you can't beat 'em, pretend you joined 'em.&quot;</SPAN></P>

And the squirrel here has been going after Hillary with tweet-zingers like, 'Hillary Clinton is squirrelly if she thinks the Taliban aren't a threat to us' and 'Hillary Clinton is trying to hide her record on Benghazi the way I hide acorns.' Wow. Those are some stinging nut puns. I can't wait for more. ...

Fortunately, Congress sent a seven-member delegation on a fact-finding mission to Honduras and Guatemala, and the truth could not be more what I wanted it to be. According to Congressman Steve Pearce, 'Most immigrants from Central America who are crossing illegally into the United States are driven by economic reasons, not fear of physical danger in their homeland.'

I've always been a huge fan of Sarah Palin. She's a strong leader with a proven history of selflessness. In the midst of her 2008 campaign, she took time to help out a struggling senior with severely impaired judgment. And this week, in her continuing quest to remind America of her existence, Palin announced a new project. ? Yes, the all-Sarah Palin channel!

He said, 'I'll drive the bus.' But then, this also caught people's eye. Ryan wrote on his Facebook page, 'The Packers are looking so good, I'd drive their bus.' And we know that he's a Packers fan. But then he posted on the Partridge Family's page, and said, 'Hey, Partridge Family, are you guys still a thing? If you're not, I guess that bus ain't being used.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of Obama, the White House dismissed former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta's criticisms of President Obama, saying that he's faced some of the most difficult issues of our time - which would be a great defense if every president didn't face the most difficult issues of their time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, Joe Biden, he's just not helping. He's helping our monologues, but that's about it.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am absolutely stunned that John Boehner is raising money for a homosexual candidate and confessed gay person, Carl DeMaio.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new survey found that more than half of Americans see President Obama's time in office as a failure. While the rest said, 'You saw him in his office? When?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was in his office yesterday. In fact, President Obama met with the temporary Secret Service director in the Oval Office to talk about all the recent White House security breaches. Of course, first they had to address the elephant in the room. Not metaphorically - there was an actual elephant wandered into the White House. Security is just awful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess it's all getting to him now, because during a fundraiser yesterday, President Obama said he understands feeling like, quote, 'The world is spinning so fast, and nobody is able to control it.' Then scientists said, 'Well that's probably because the world is spinning fast and you can't control it.' That's a fact.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some more political news - a new study estimates that only 3.4 percent of Americans will vote in the mid-term elections next month. But on the bright side, 100 percent will still complain about the results.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seth Meyers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More bad news for the President. President Obama's latest approval rating is just 43 percent. But not everyone hates him. A lot of people are breaking into the White House just to try and meet him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seth Meyers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney is back in the news. He's back in the news. When asked about a possible 2016 presidential run by Mitt Romney, John McCain said everybody in the Republican Party likes Mitt Romney. And then he slammed his locker and went to gym class.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're getting ready for Halloween down there at the White House. They have a big pumpkin carving and, you know, the cool thing about it, the pumpkins they're carving came out of Michelle Obama's vegetable garden. She raised pumpkins they're using for the jack-o'-lanterns, and the knife that they use to carve came from a guy who hopped over the fence.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Referring to the &quot;Republicans Are People, Too&quot; TV ad campaign] &quot;Nation, it seems like every time you turn on the news lately, you hear something that shocks you to your core. Just this morning, I was horrified to find out there is an election next month. And this midterm season, the best political ad does not promote a candidate. It promotes a demonized minority [Republicans]. Yes, Republicans are people, too. I have not seen such courageous rebranding since White Castle's 'It is food.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A big story out of Washington. They just announced that the budget deficit has shrunk to only $486 billion, which is its lowest point since President Obama took office. Obama was like, 'Well, I guess we'll just have to work harder and - wait, is that good news?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of the President, today, he gave a speech in California to motivate young voters by discussing his commitments to new technology. Ironically, nobody heard him 'cause they were all staring at their phones.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Midterm elections are right around the corner and politicians are doing everything they can to get people to vote. In fact, during a speech yesterday, first lady Michelle Obama went so far as to say voting can actually be a fun thing to do on a first date. Yeah. Really, what better way to make a first date go smoothly than bringing up politics right off the bat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, a new study estimates that only 3.4 percent of all Americans will vote in the midterm elections next month. Three percent, yeah. Because of that, both parties have started campaigns with entirely new slogans to encourage people to get out to vote. But I'm not sure that they're very successful. Take a look. Here's the first one. 'You know that thing you do to choose the person who wins 'Dancing with the Stars?' Try that with politicians.' That seems lazy. Here's another one here. 'If you don't vote, you can't complain. Well, actually you can. But it's better if you vote. You're not gonna vote, are you?' Seems like a downer. And finally there's - 'Voting! It's how average citizens fool themselves into thinking they're in charge!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some more political news this week. A spokesman for Harry Reid said even though Joe Biden makes a lot of mistakes, he's still able to connect and tells us what's on his mind. It's sounds less like he's talking about the Vice President and more like a chimpanzee that knows sign language.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seth Meyers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kim Jong-un has been out of the public eye and North Korean officials say that it's because he needs a total of 100 days to recover from his foot ailments. When asked what kind of foot ailments, they said liposuction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seth Meyers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, President Obama criticized the Republican Party for being a party of billionaires, while speaking at the $26 million Connecticut home of a man named Rich Richmond.

But it's five years later and he's been unable to disarm one of the largest nuclear powers in the world - him.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Referring to the Obama Administration's reason for nuclear weapons upgrade plan.] &quot;That's right, instead of decommissioning our nukes, we're saving them to shoot down asteroids.

And while we still don't know the official results, the 'Washington Post' is predicting that there is a 98 percent chance of the Republicans taking the Senate.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday was, of course, Election Day. There were a number of pot-related items on state ballots. Alaska, Oregon and Washington, DC, voted to legalize recreational marijuana. Vice President Joe Biden celebrated quietly at home, contemplating the infinite nature of the universe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Imagine, Washington, DC - if you thought Congress didn't get a lot of work done before, just wait until they get legal pot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Florida, a measure to legalize medical marijuana did not pass. Which, that's probably for the best, right? People in Florida are weird enough already.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remarkably, the very liberal state of California still has not legalized marijuana for recreational use. Though, due to the drought we are having here, we are considering making it legal to drink bong water.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you probably know, Republicans picked up a lot of seats and won control of both chambers of Congress yesterday, which is key, because whoever controls Congress controls the lunch menu at the cafeteria.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republicans have a majority in the Senate and House of Representatives for the first time in eight years. I guess when it was all said and done, the Republicans just had the better lawn signs.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Huge night for the Republicans across the country. They won everything - the Senate majority, the bigger House majority, tight governor's races, and a giraffe from one of those claw machines.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big news, of course, is the mid-term elections. Last night, Republicans picked up a dozen seats in the House to give them their biggest majority since World War II. Or, as they put it, 'Time to party like it's 1939!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'They also took control of the Senate, after gaining another seven seats. I haven't seen the GOP get this many seats since Chris Christie made an airline reservation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I saw that Republican Scott Brown lost his bid for Senate in New Hampshire last night, two years after he was voted out as senator in Massachusetts.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seth Meyers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Republicans won enough seats to gain a majority in the Senate and increase their majority in the House.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But, history was made. For the first time ever, a black, Republican woman has been elected to Congress. President Obama gave her a congratulatory call and told her, 'You're all set. This country never turns against the first black anything.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pope Francis will be here in the United States for a visit. ? What a Pope. This guy is in favor of gay rights, female priests, contraception. You know things are strange when the Pope is more progressive than the Republicans.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;]The new] ObamaCare website is better. For example, when you log into the new Healthcare.gov, it offers you a choice of insurance options, rather than brunch options at Denny's in Kalamazoo. Also, the new website loads quickly, whereas the old site would cut the brakes in your car.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Referring to President Obama's planned executive orders on immigration] &quot;It is well known Barack Obama has been violating the Constitution for years. Well, now he wants to roll it up, stuff it with rice and beans, and top it with picante sauce. ? How dare he take executive action to address immigration, by himself. He should be working with Congress to do nothing together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even worse, the rumor is he's going to overhaul the immigration system through fiat. Fiat? If anything goes wrong - you have to order new parts from Italy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And just listen to what's in Obama's plan. It would 'protect up to five million unauthorized immigrants from the threat of deportation and provide many of them with work permits.' They get to stay and receive work permits. Now they're coming for the jobs they already have.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the whole plan cheapens what it means to be an American, because 'the Department of Homeland Security would take 50 percent off the fee for the first 10,000 applicants.' Fifty percent off. Obama's tossing American citizenship in the bargain bin with the stale Halloween candy and un-bagged underwear.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama's going to 'expand visas for foreign-born workers with high-tech skills.' Why foreigners? Americans already have plenty of high-tech skills. Like operating an iPhone to contact a call center in India.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I saw that yesterday C-SPAN set up a phone line for undocumented immigrants to call in [and] share their perspective on the immigration debate in the US.

No, no, this is it - the day we all feared would come, ever since we were told it would come several months ago - has come at last. Because tonight at 8:00 p.m. Mexican Standard Time, Generalissimo Obama announced his unilateral plan to allow four million illegal immigrants to remain in America without fear of deportation.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of Obama, I saw that he will travel to Las Vegas tomorrow to speak at the same?high school where he laid out his plan for immigration almost two years ago.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the White House yesterday, they kicked off Computer Science Education Week. Students from a school in Newark were on hand to give tutorials on computer code,&quot; and President Obama &quot;sat down and wrote one. The program he wrote was not very complex.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An expected flurry of activity in Congress. Congress agreed to a trillion-dollar spending bill to avoid another government shutdown. It seems like the only time they get anything done in Congress is at the last minute. Maybe we should figure out a way of making it always the last minute.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaker of the House John Boehner said he hopes the bill will pass. This is more than just a bill to him. It's a personal issue, because if the government shuts down again, he will lose the Oompa Loompa who paints his face orange.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If it doesn't pass, the Federal government will run out of money tomorrow. In the richest country on earth, we will run out of money tomorrow.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congress goes on recess starting tomorrow night. By the way, that's all you need to know about Congress. They get recess. Bunch of middle-aged, adult men and women get three weeks off to play kick ball? That's what you do at recess, right?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Referring to the Senate CIA interrogation report] &quot;It turns out this torture activity was going on and George Bush had no idea that this was taking place. The CIA was doing all of this torturing activity, and George Bush - and I thought, now, wait a minute. This doesn't sound like the George Bush I know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Referring to the Senate CIA interrogation report] &quot;Yes, a damning report about enhanced interrogation. The program was started under President Bush, if you recall. And if you don't recall, the CIA has ways to make you. It's all detailed in this 500-page travesty, which spills sensitive torture secrets and reads like '50 Shades of Legal Grey Areas.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, the big news out of Washington is this report on CIA interrogation techniques. Today, President Obama was talking about the report and praised our country's ability to, quote, 'Face our imperfections, make changes and do better.'

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nothing but trouble for Obama these days. In fact, according to a new poll, 55 percent of Americans think Republicans focus more on pushing Obama's buttons than actually pursuing their agenda. Then Republicans said, 'Not true.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People think Republicans focus too much on pushing Obama's buttons. Incidentally, pushing Obama's buttons is also the reason why Biden isn't allowed in the Oval Office anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I read that many Republicans think that the fact that Chris Christie is still standing strong after his 'Bridgegate' scandal could make him an even better presidential candidate in 2016. That's not surprising. I mean, everyone knows Weebles wobble, but they do not fall down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During a recent interview, Jeb Bush's brother, Neil, said that their mother has come around to the idea of Jeb running for president in 2016. So, if there's anything that says you're qualified to be president, it's your own mom going, 'I guess you could do it. I guess.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seth Meyers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker wrote a letter this week wishing his constituents a Happy Hanukkah, which is very nice. But he used the term Molotov instead of mazel tov, which is bad. That's not great. You don't have to be Jewish to know that's not great. But he did make up for it, because he told his Jewish constituents he's going to personally light the Macarena.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
