<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big story, of course, hurricane Irene. Turned out to be not as bad as originally thought, which is good news. It was actually downgraded to a tropical storm. See, how sad is that? Even our hurricanes are being downgraded now. Apparently it must owe money to the Chinese, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, Wall Street didn't get flooded at all. They were protected by a huge wall made out of Federal stimulus cash 20 feet high. All that money that kept it so safe and dry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know I love - you know - all the news programs made a big deal out of President Obama cutting his vacation short by one day to go back to the White House to deal with hurricane Irene. Not a big sacrifice. He was on an island during a hurricane. Okay? Of course you leave early. Of course. It's 100 mile-an-hour winds on an island, let's stay another day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the rhetoric is heating up between Republicans Rick Perry and Mitt Romney. Oh, these two don't like each other. Perry has opposed many of Romney's positions. To be fair, so has Romney. So, it's not hard to say.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Joe Biden has been in China meeting with the Chinese Vice President. One embarrassing moment during the trip when he met the Chinese Vice President's children and said, 'Hey, what factory do you work in?' Kind of odd, yeah. Kind of weird, yeah. 'Those are nice sneakers, did you make those?' A little international incident kind of a thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Dick Cheney's new book is out. It comes out tomorrow. This is Dick Cheney's new book. It's right here. It's called 'Torture in the Rye.' You don't want to miss this. Fascinating book. Nobody can sneer like Dick Cheney. That is great. Look at that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you folks in the balcony, are you here for the show or are you just looking for high ground? What is going on? Hurricane Irene came whipping through here -- 800,000 residents from New Jersey still without power. But it's okay. They've hooked them up to Governor Christy's backup generator on his refrigerator. Everything will be fine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everything's great at my house -- thanks for asking. Yeah, it's been boarded up for years. So not a problem. But here in New York City, this, you know, you got a big city like this and a massive storm and Mayor Bloomberg, bless his heart, a nice job. Think about it, we had that earthquake, had the earthquake. And Mayor Bloomberg, remember the shots of him standing under his desk?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Right after the earthquake - well, you don't think about things. Of course you have to evacuate. Of course you have to have flashlight, drinking water. You think about those things. What you don't think about, the aftermath of the earthquake or the hurricane. Wow, just line them up. Where are you folks going next, Tripoli? What's next. But it's that - it's the after the wet rat smell. Awful, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, good news after hurricane Irene. Wall Street is up and running are as usual. The bad news, Wall Street is up and running as usual.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that Republican candidate Michelle Bachmann. Yeah, she says that the hurricane was God's message to Washington D.C. Do you suppose God is saying to himself, 'Why do I attract all the crack pots? Why...What is the... What is it about me?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just before I came out here I heard that the second in command of Al Qaeda was killed over the weekend. Too bad. He seemed like such a nice guy. And the fact that now they got to replace the guy, well that shows me that there is opportunity for advancement in Al Qaeda. So you can't argue with that, you know what I mean? But the guy had been on the job less than two months. Boy, that Tim Pawlenty's campaign lasted longer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's something weird I heard about. You now rebels who broke into Moammar Gadhafi's place, they said it was kind of creepy. And he had a photo album and it was full of pictures of former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice. Who doesn't have one of those? You know, I mean I...guilty there. But Gadhafi is apparently on the run, although today he did release one of those messages that these guys do. And in it, he congratulated Beyonce, you know, she's pregnant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former Vice President, oh, now this is great. Dick Cheney, you all remember Vice President Dick 'Kaboom' Cheney -- he's written a book and in the book he says he would do it all over again, the same way he would make no changes. He said really, he would still honestly he still feels strongly about this. He would still invade the wrong country. He is so confident that ... And Dick says that the reason he wrote the memoir is because of friends encouraged him to do it. What? This guy has friends! What? And you know, remember, Dick Cheney he had the heart attack. And during one of the heart attacks, he was unconscious for two weeks. Two weeks -- he was clinically dead for two weeks. I know a lot of are you saying well that's not long enough, Dave. That's not long enough. That's not what we're looking for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Happy birthday to John McCain, who turned 75 years old today. He's a good man. A lot has changed since he was born. Back then, a dollar was worth 20 cents. Today it's not worth nearly that much. I must say, McCain's old, but he thought Hurricane Irene was a flapper he had a crush on in the '20s.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Get this, in a recent interview, Dick Cheney said that his new memoir will have, 'heads exploding in D.C.' Yeah. Especially if you read it while you're on a hunting trip with Dick Cheney. 'I thought it was a duck. It was just you reading the book, sorry.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, a big story. Former Vice President Dick Cheney's new memoir came out today -- contains some startling surprises. For example, did you know this? He is still alive. I was stunned.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Believe me, this book is not for the fainthearted. It was written by the fainthearted. But yeah, it's not for the fainthearted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, it's interesting -- although Cheney's book was just released today, people already criticizing it. In fact, today, President Bush said, 'not enough pictures.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And former secretary of state Colin Powell says that Cheney took cheap shots at him in the new book. Cheney's lawyer friend said, 'Cheap shots? Hey, you're lucky. He actually shot me, okay?' I'll take buckshot over -- Yeah. Please. He got buckshot, you got cheap shot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, coming in today, I found a quarter on the sidewalk. Finally, some change I can believe in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you, well, President Obama ? President Obama has chosen Princeton labor economist Alan Krueger as the new White House economist. Krueger is considered an expert on unemployment. You know, these days, a lot of people are experts on unemployment, okay? How about getting a guy who is an expert on employment? Why don't we get that guy? That's the guy we need.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Listen to this, listen to this -- I am not ? I am not making this up. Economists are now saying that Hurricane Irene will actually help the economy. The idea being that people who have been saving money during the recession will now use that money to buy things like windows and repair items. See, that's when you know the economy's in bad shape, okay? When the best plan Washington can come up with is 'hey, how about more hurricanes and tornados? Earthquakes? That's what we need. Yeah, more earthquakes.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And speaking of that, the big earthquake we had last week caused cracks in the Washington Monument. Experts say the biggest crack problem in D.C. since Mayor ... since Marion Barry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Obama recently took a three-state bus tour. It went well. Probably because his uncle wasn't driving.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, not good. President Obama's uncle Omar was arrested in Massachusetts on suspicion of drunk driving. Had a blood alcohol level of 0.14. I'm sorry. That's the President's approval rating. I'm sorry. I got it confused. No, no. You know, it seems like...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you noticed this? Every president we elect ? there's always one embarrassing member of the family. Like for Jimmy Carter, it was his brother, Billy. For Bill Clinton, it was his brother, Roger. For George W. Bush, it was George W. Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's something I never heard of -- the Food and Drug Administration has approved the use of Botox to treat incontinence. Did you know Botox treated incontinence? Did you know that? In fact, Nancy Pelosi hasn't gone to the bathroom in 15 years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that Moammar Gadhafi? Where is Moammar Gadhafi? Where is that guy? They go into Tripoli, they say we're going into the compound, they go into the compound, they can't find him. They busted into one of his palaces, he had escape tunnels. He had gold plumbing fixtures. He had naked photos of Condoleezza Rice. I mean it's like I have a twin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, have you bought the new Dick Cheney memoir? Anybody get the new Dick Cheney memoir? It's... it's going to be a best-seller. It's published I think [by] Simon &amp; Shooter, it's going to be fantastic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;It was a great day if you like happy summertime reading. In bookstores today, I've been looking forward to this for years now, Dick Cheney's memoir 'In My Time' actually came out at midnight, which was about 38 minutes ago in your region. This is like a big deal in Washington. In Washington D.C., this is like a Harry Potter book. Around the block from the bookstore there's angry old men lined up wearing bald caps and shocking each other's nipples and water-boarding each other. Going aaahhh! Then they heard about Cheney's book coming out. See what I did?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;When I saw Cheney was in the news, I thought he joined the cast of 'Dancing with the Stars.' It turns out they already have one opinionated dude who everyone hates. Rikki Lake. It's a joke! I like Rikki Lake.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, I finished reading Dick Cheney's new book last night. I don't want to ruin it for anybody, but in the final chapter, he kills Harry Potter. I was stunned.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, in the book, Cheney defends his controversial national security and domestic policies. Now, if you want to find the book at your local bookstore, go past the self-help section. It's in the self-serving section. It's right in there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, my. How about that Republican presidential candidate, Michele Bachmann? Isn't she something? She is now publishing her memoirs, and I thought, 'Wait a minute, why can't we pray that away?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Michele Bachmann has that haircut. You see that haircut on the woman? It's all the rage. If you want to get the Michele Bachmann haircut, go into the beauty salon and ask for 'the whacko.' That will get you where you want to be.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;How about that Moammar Gadhafi, speaking of whackos, ladies and gentlemen. It turns out he has an obsessive attraction to Condoleezza Rice, former secretary of state. He has pictures of her. He has a full album of naked photos of Condoleezza Rice. Have you ever started to tell a joke and then realized maybe it hits a little too close to home?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That Gadhafi, they're looking for him. He's got a two million dollar price on his head. I thought, 'I've got a two million dollar price on my tongue.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;C.I.A. is hoping that Gadhafi's weapons don't fall into the wrong hands and I thought, 'Wait a minute. Weren't they already in the wrong hands?' That's what I thought.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, have you folks read the Dick Cheney memoir? Yes. It's fascinating. It's in its third printing. The first two were waterboarded.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I bought 50 of them. It's a big, big book. I bought 50 of them and it's fascinating. Over the weekend, I used them to board up the basement so I wouldn't...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some major business news, you guys. The Justice Department is trying to block the merger between AT&amp;T and T-Mobile. It's only fair, I mean, AT&amp;T keeps trying to block the calls between me and the people I call.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is interesting. In a new interview, President Obama said that Ben Franklin is the Founding Father he would most like to meet. Meanwhile, Joe Biden said that Panthro is the Thundercat he would most like to meet.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And he caved again today when the 'Housewives of New Jersey' called and said, 'Hey, move it. Our show is on at that time.' So, they got to move it again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then the kids from 'Toddlers in Tiaras' called, and then they had to move it again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And former Vice President Dick Cheney is out promoting his new book. He's going to be here tomorrow. The book is an inside look on what it's like to be president - uh, vice president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;George Bush said he hasn't read Dick Cheney's book yet. He said, nothing personal, but he hasn't still made it through Barney the White House dog's book. Remember that one? That was - that was a good 30 pages.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the latest report - this came out today. The latest report said that Moammar Gadhafi has been traveling around Libya - Tripoli rather, disguised as a woman. Yeah. Today, rebels mistakenly picked up Bruce Jenner. Yeah, it was terrible. Yeah, it's a terrible thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here is one of those weird things. Listen to this. Recently in Massachusetts, President Obama's uncle was arrested for a DUI -- driving under the influence. And here's the odd part, the ironic part of the story. His alcohol level was actually higher than Obama's approval rating. Obama's approval rating is 38%, 38%. Hell, I'd kill for numbers like that. You know what I mean?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But now, next week President Obama will unveil his jobs bill. I'm sure that will sail right through.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Oh, everybody ready for Labor Day? Of course, it's the day that we celebrate our workforce and do we still have a workforce?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not such a great day for Moammar Gadhafi. Moammar Gadhafi. I'm going to call him Margaret Gadhafi. He has had a few not-so-good days in a row recently. It looks like he might be cornered by the Libyan rebels. He put out a statement today. I'm going to put out a statement. Are you sure, Margaret? I'm not kidding. I quote him. This is what he said. 'We will keep fighting. We are not women.' I'm like, are you saying that women don't fight? Because obviously, Margaret, you have never met a woman! Craig, are you implying that Margaret Gadhafi is nuts? I t is a controversial stance but yes, I'm saying it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Check this out. President Obama has declared that September is national childhood obesity awareness months. And if you're looking for a way to celebrate, I recommend a mac &amp; cheese big daddy patty from Denny's.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;These are not easy times for the American worker. Wages are stagnant. Job growth is near zero. Worst of all, next year is going into the election cycle.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said that President Obama's uncle, remember Uncle Omar? Remember he got arrested last week for DUI? Well, he said he will not get any help from the White House, especially if he's looking for a job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And on Thursday, President Obama will give a speech on job growth. How many think it's going to be a short speech? Yeah, I think it's not going to be a big speech.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the latest 'Wall Street Journal' poll, a record 73% of Americans believe the country is headed in the wrong direction. But the good news? Gas is so expensive and traffic is so bad, we'll never get there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And earlier today in Las Vegas, Mitt Romney announced a 59 point job plan at a big auto dealership. See, that shows you how smart Romney is. He knows the only time politicians look honest is when he's standing next to a car salesman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, just 24 hours before the biggest debate of her life, Michele Bachmann's campaign manager and deputy campaign manager have resigned. And even worse, God hasn't called her in over a week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In four years, Michele Bachmann has gone through six chiefs of staff, five press secretaries, five legislative directors and three communication directors. But the good news, she can now claim she has single-handedly created more jobs than the White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you have nice Labor Day, folks? Labor Day is the day Americans take three days off from looking for work so it's not what it used to be.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top Ten Signs Michele O'Bachmann's Campaign is in Trouble.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. Intern answers phone, 'Hello, O'Bachmann Train Wreck.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. She keeps referring to the governor of Texas as Katy Perry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Husband is leaving campaign to host a makeover show on Bravo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Spent last weekend campaigning in Juarez, Mexico.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Ranks behind that creepy middle-aged white guy, that other creepy middle-aged white guy and barely ahead of other creepy middle-aged white guy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Only polling well with people who are heavily medicated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. 'Headquarters' is now the backseat of a Hyundai Sonata.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Claims bad weather is God punishing us for J-Lo and Marc Anthony break up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Has yet to acknowledge the road to the White House goes through me, Dave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. She's running out of bat-[bleep] crazy things to say.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of President Obama's speech writers quit his job so he could pursue his life-long dream of writing comedy. Yeah. So now he's a speech writer for Michele Bachmann.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of Michele Bachmann, she said she would eliminate the Department of Education because it is not written into the original Constitution. Then she retracted the statement when someone told her, also not written in the original Constitution, the right for a woman to run for President. So, it's one of those things that's tricky.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama refused to give specifics about his jobs plan yesterday because he wants people to tune in on Thursday. That's not how you handle the economy, that's how you handle the 'American Idol' results show. [imitates Obama] I have a plan, like to bring millions back to work, you'll find out more -- after the break.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Good news, though. President Obama announced that on the very first day that the government was back in session he would give a speech to both houses of congress on the very pressing topic of jobs. ... Damn! A Republican debate the very same night the President wishes to speak about jobs. I know where this is going to go. Loggerheads, battles, conflict, government shutdown, escalation of rhetoric, race war, feral leprechauns roaming the streets. We're doomed! ... Well, there you have it. The President offered a date, the Republicans said 'Could you move that a day?' and the President said 'All right.' Non-crisis averted. It's the first installment of what I hope will be many in our new segment 'Tales of Reasonable Accommodation.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the Republican debate was held earlier tonight. It got pretty heated. In fact they spent most of the time arguing over who God called first.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, it's not the most impressive field of candidates. Watch these candidates. Kind of like when Apple unveiled the new iPhone, part of you is going, 'Maybe if I wait a while, a better one will come out.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of pundits feel the Republicans may be searching for someone who doesn't exist. But, you know, sometimes the answer is right under your nose. The Republicans want someone who supports the wars, who will not take away tax cuts from the rich and who could appeal to a small group of Democrats. They have that guy, his name's Barack Obama.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Michele Bachmann said if she's elected President, she would consider eliminating the Department of Education. Yeah, that's what she said. She said if the Department of Education is eliminated, the states could do a gooder job of teaching children.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And tomorrow, President Obama will give his big speech on job preservation, I mean, creation. Job creation. The President's speech will be translated to Spanish and Chinese, so the people who now have our jobs will be able to understand it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The latest statistics show the US economy created zero jobs in August. Zero. But President Obama said he's confident this month he can double that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, and I think this is really true, according the latest polls, people really like President Obama personally, but they don't like his politics. It's like we're still friends with him on Facebook, but we've changed our status to, 'It's complicated.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a big Republican debate earlier tonight, and that Mitt Romney, you know who I'm talking about when I say Mitt Romney? He would, historians agree, be first President of this country named Mitt. But Mitt Romney is saying that President Obama's job plan is a payphone strategy. Now listen to this. This is a cute turn of phrase. Obama's jobs strategy is a payphone strategy in a Smartphone world. Not bad, huh? Yeah, like Mitt ever used a payphone! Come on, that guy! I don't think so. No.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I mentioned the Republican debate was on earlier tonight. Side effects may include dizziness, nausea, and sexual dysfunction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about Michele Bachmann, Republican presidential candidate. She is dropping quickly in polls. That's too bad. Yeah, three more points, and she goes on 'Dancing With the Stars.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, her popularity with regard to running for President, it's dropping, but the people love her haircut. I don't think this has ever happened where they're not crazy about her as a candidate, but they love her haircut. It's really caught on. And if you want one like Michele Bachmann's, all you have to do is go to your haircutting place, Supercuts, your beauty salon, or wherever you go and say, 'Give me the lunatic.' That's what you say.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't know if you've seen all the candidates together in one place, but they look like castaways on an old sitcom. The billionaire, the movie star, the professor, the skipper there. They're all there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Republican presidential candidates are having a debate today at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. It was going to be the George W. Bush Library but they couldn't fit all eight candidates into the bouncy house. It deflates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are now saying that Texas Governor Rick Perry is really tough because he has executed over 200 people. Yeah. And that was just while he was on vacation in Florida one week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama in the news, President Obama has moved his big speech on the economy tomorrow to just before the NFL season opener. Yeah, now as a sign of how bad the economy is, the NFL had to borrow the quarter for the coin toss from China.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Iowa this weekend Sarah Palin ran a half marathon and came in second place. Yeah. Of course, no one saw her do it because she refused to tell anyone she was running.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The oil industry said if they could drill more, they could get a million new jobs. Of course, most of those jobs would be cleaning oil off ducks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ford is building a new plant that will create 5,000 jobs, all in India. Or as Obama put it, 'You got to be freaking kidding me.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Hey, this is just insane; a shirtless man in Indiana was just arrested for running on the highway with a samurai sword while yelling that he was cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs. In fact the guy was so nuts; NBC invited him to take part in tonight's Republican debate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I can tell you one thing right now in the Republican Party, it's a battle between Mitt Romney and Rick Perry. Not only have both men have been governors, but both could have just as easily found themselves cast in one of those middle-aged male kayaker with prostate problems advertisements.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Nation, it's hard to believe, but this Sunday is the tenth anniversary of September 11th attacks. Which means we can't be more than five years away from finding Saddam's WMDs. Since that tragic day, the American government has done whatever is necessary to safeguard the Homeland. From enhanced interrogation to inventing the phrase 'The Homeland.' We even tried to find common ground with Muslim extremists by electing one of them President.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;This has been a rough summer for President Obama. Once again, his approval rating has hit an all-time low. Right now, his rating is somewhere between 'Teen Mom' and 'Sex and the City 2.' But then again his disapproval rating is at an all-time high. The 'Wall Street Journal' has the rating at just 44% and ABC poll has him at 43%. And Yelp has him at, like, one and a half stars. I don't think Malia is speaking to him right now. What other job are you forced to hear how many people think you suck three times a week?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Tonight, the Republican candidates got together for a debate at the Ronald Reagan Library in California. ... I played a fun game during the debate. We watched it in my office. Every time they mentioned Ronald Reagan, I ate a jelly bean. And guess what? I have Type II diabetes now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Tonight, all eyes were on Texas Governor Rick Perry. Except for Michele Bachmann's eyes, which no one has any idea where they are looking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;For those of you who aren't familiar with Perry, he's kind of a mixture of George W. Bush and Yosemite W. Sam. I like him. I like him because he appeared to be feathering his hair. You don't see that much.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;One potential candidate, who has not announced her intentions, is Sarah Palin. She's out there. She surprised people by running unannounced in a half marathon in Iowa on Sunday. Or did she run a half marathon or run half a marathon and quit? Do we know? Governor, marathoner, is there anything Sarah Palin can't do half of?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;The other high profile Republican who might possibly throw his hat in the ring is New Jersey governor Chris Christie. He doesn't necessarily want to be President, but he really wants to get out of New Jersey. ... Over the weekend, a former speech writer for President Bush said Christie is actively weighing the option of jumping into the race. Actively weighing might not be the best choice of words. Or jumping, either, for that matter. He would be the first President, if elected, to be forced to buy two seats on Air Force One. I got to say something. I love the idea of having a fat President. Obama is a skinny guy who works out. That's not America. We should be represented by one of our own, by someone who can't bend over to tie his own shoes. A guy who needs a seat belt extender in the car. A man who keeps bottles of barbecue sauce in his glove box just in case. That's what I want.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rick Perry and Mitt Romney squared off at the big Republican debate last night. They only agreed on one thing, shampoo, rinse and repeat. That's the only two things they agreed on. Don't Romney and Perry look like two guys waiting to audition for the same part in a soap opera?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, history was made at the Reagan library last night. I believe it's the first time Michele Bachmann has ever been in a library.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a lot of crazy promises. Michele Bachmann says she could get us back to $2 gas. Please. Only way she's going to get $2 gas, Taco Bell. You're never going to see that. I'm sorry. Never going to happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it got kinda contentious when Ron Paul attacked Rick Perry. He attacked Rick Perry for supporting Al Gore back in '88. See back in 1988 Rick Perry was a big Al Gore fan. But to be fair, even Tipper Gore was supporting Al Gore back then. Did you know Perry used to be a Democrat? But then again, Barack Obama used to be a Democrat. You know, everybody changes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And earlier this evening, President Obama gave his big jobs speech. So we had tonight was the guy whose job nobody approves of giving speech about jobs that don't exist with people who don't have any jobs. So it's a real positive, uplifting evening.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see the Republican presidential candidates' debate? I'm telling you, these guys and Michele Bachmann, they look like a town council that was outlawing dance. They were lying about poisoning a river. I wanted to TiVo the debate because I wanted to see it and my TiVo felt asleep.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then Rick Perry, you can smell his cologne through the TV. Whoa! He doesn't believe in global warming, thinks Social Security is a Ponzi scheme, has executed 234 people, in other words, he's a Republican moderate. He's a moderate. He's a centrist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rick Perry said something interesting. He said he understands healthcare because his wife is a nurse. He also said he understands terrorism because he watched all eight seasons of '24.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During the debate ultraconservative Rick Santorum said 'I am the son of an Italian immigrant.' Immediately after making the comment, Santorum had his dad deported.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;President Obama addressed a joint session of Congress tonight and the focus was on jobs. Obama was supposed to give the speech last night but House Speaker John Boehner asked him to move it to tonight so it wouldn't interfere with the Republican presidential debate which is code for 'my weekly appointment at Mystic Tan.' He likes to glow when Congress comes back in session.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;The plan Obama detailed is a $450 billion piece of legislation he's calling the American Jobs Act. He plans to create thousands of new jobs by replacing all automobile GPS systems with real people who sit in the backseat with a map. So that will be good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;I don't know why everyone is hung up on getting a job. Jobs suck. You have to wake up early. You have to work. Isn't it better to be able to stay up until 4:30 in the morning watching reruns of 'Sanford and Son' on TV Land? Trust me, it is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;The President said, we need to have more products stamped 'Made in America.' All right, let's get the Chinese to get a stamp that says 'Made in America.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;A handful of Republicans said they are going to skip Obama's speech altogether. One of them was David Vitter. He was upset because they didn't give him a plus-one for his hooker, and that isn't right. And South Carolina Senator Jim DeMint said he would skip the speech because he's, quote, 'sick and tired of speeches.' I guess he's in the perfect line of work then.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cuban leader Fidel Castro made a rare TV appearance yesterday. He said everyone kept reporting that he's dead, but he's actually alive and well. But, he said he went on TV basically to prove that he's still alive. Pretty much the same reason President Obama went on TV last night. 'I'm still here. I've got your jobs!'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, President Obama introduced his $447 billion job plan. It sounds like a pretty good plan. In fact, a lot of economists said today it could work, you know, if we had $447 billion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In his speech, President Obama called the plan 'The American Job Act.' It sounds a lot better than the original title, 'The Save My Ass Act.' That tends to fall flat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But, you know something, I think last night's speech shows how far we've come as a country. When an African-American President can be just as unpopular as the white President that preceded him, that is progress. That shows that we are a great country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And there was no Republican rebuttal last night after this speech. If you watch his speech, you can see why. None of the Republicans were listening.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, did you see all the Republican candidates lined up at the Reagan Library the other night? Didn't it look like it was part of Disney's Hall of Never Will Be Presidents?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Michele Bachmann said, if she became President, she would consider doing away with the Department of Education. That's what she said. But see, that's kind of a self-serving thing for her, because if there was no Department of Education, it would make it a lot easier for her to get elected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, Michele Bachmann's campaign has suffered some setbacks in the last couple of weeks. Her campaign manager stepped down. Her deputy campaign manager left. And listen to this, God hasn't called her in almost a week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In his speech last night, President Obama introduced a $400 billion plan called the American jobs act. Yeah. Would've had a more creative name, but the guy who comes up with names got laid off six months ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Last night, President Obama said, 'No single individual built America on their own.' When she heard that, Sarah Palin was like, 'Uh, hello? Paul Bunyan? He had the ponytail, eye patch. Used to ride the skateboard around. Throw guitar picks. He invented paper towels?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Actually, House Speaker John Boehner said that President Obama's job plan merits consideration. Then he was like, 'In fact, I'll do it right now. Okay, I hate it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Some more political news. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie was just named the new Vice Chair of the Republican Governors Association. Incidentally, a new chair is what they're going to need after Chris Christie.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, folks, there was there another Republican presidential debate tonight. Although, this time, the debate was up against 'Monday Night Football.' So it was kind of like the NFL versus the LOL.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Mitt Romney went after President Obama saying Obama doesn't understand that the President does not create jobs. That's what Romney said. The President does not create jobs. Then Romney went on to describe his plan to create jobs once he is elected President.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, you know, at the Republican debate the other night, the audience applauded when it was mentioned that since Rick Perry has been Governor of Texas, 234 criminals have been executed. See, that's the difference between Texas and California, right here. In California, those criminals would have been given tryouts with the Raiders. You know, at least they would have had an opportunity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The economy is so bad, that for the Patriots/Dolphin kickoff tonight, the officials had to provide their own coin. The economy is so bad Lady Gaga now dressing up like a man to get the higher salary. The economy is so bad, Kim Kardashian actually seen buying items from her own clothing line at Sears. The economy is so bad, in Texas, Rick Perry had to execute convicts just by throwing a toaster in the bathtub.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In his jobs plan President Obama described himself as an eternal optimist. Isn't that nice? Yeah. He then explained, 'I'm the kinds of person who sees the country as half employed.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last week in Michigan a man wearing a President Obama mask robbed a bank. Either that, or President Obama has an exciting new plan to reduce the deficit. Wouldn't that be great? Where did this money come from? 'Don't ask me where I got this money.' He takes it from one bank and gives it to another.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big Republican debate tonight. Earlier today former Minnesota Governor, Tim Pawlenty, endorsed Mitt Romney, calling him 'a bedrock conservative.' After hearing this, John McCain said, 'Hey, I grew up in Bedrock. I do not remember seeing the man.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rick Perry has launched right into the lead, way ahead of everyone else. Now we're finding out different facts about him. It's been reported that Rick Perry met his wife when they were in elementary school. Isn't that sweet? Actually at the time there was another boy who liked her, too, but nine year-old Rick Perry had him executed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new poll, only 55% of Americans think President Obama is intelligent. Yeah. That may not sound impressive, but it's up 55% over the last President, so, major improvement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;This week's New York 9th Congressional District is holding a special election to replace Anthony Weiner. You know, I was going to make a joke about this, but it's just so hard at this point.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;[On the name of the 'American Jobs Act'] That's all you got? The American Jobs Act? Was employment ideas TBD already taken? Come on, even your crappy bills have aspirational qualities to them. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. We didn't and it wasn't. But it was trying. How about a little Bush-era Orwellian opposite day nomenclature? Allowing companies to incinerate hazardous waste and call it the Clear Skies Act. Give us some spin. A little humor. A little zing. The Americans Take This Job and Love It Act. The Make It Rain Act. The Remember Me, I (beep) bin Laden Employment Act of 2011. Give us something.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what I love most about that speech to the Congressional joint session, the awesome cut-aways to uncomfortable Republicans. Look at those faces. It is a veritable spectrum of poorly concealed discomfort. Every shade of discomfort represented. Eric Cantor looks like he's thinking, 'Maybe if I Don't move, the T-Rex won't see me.' Rand Paul trying not to look disgusted like if his mother-in-law was showing off belly dance lessons at a friend's confirmation. Mitch McConnell looks stunned, like a guy who just saw a dog with wheels instead of back legs roll by. And John McCain has the look of a man who had no idea the play he was watching would feature so much full frontal male nudity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Folks, tonight the Republican candidates had their second presidential debate in less than a week. And I was excited as a kid in a candy store who spent three hours in that same candy store last Wednesday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;The Tea Party hosted a debate amongst the Republican candidates for President tonight in Tampa, Florida broadcast on CNN. You know, if the Tea Party really loved America they wouldn't schedule it against the opening night of 'Monday Night Football' specifically against the Patriots of all teams. That is something Kenyans would do, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;But tonight's debate was co-hosted by CNN and an organization called the Tea Party Express. The moderators were Wolf Blitzer from CNN and Larry the Cable Guy and it was quite a night. Rick Santorum won the swimsuit competition. Michele Bachmann was voted Miss Craziality.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, threatening messages were posted on the White House Facebook page.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was another Republican debate last night, on CNN, the big winner, 'Monday Night Football on ESPN. Exactly! You know, I don't know who took more hits last night, the Dolphins, the Patriots or Rick Perry.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thee economy is so bad, paramedics can't afford defibrillators anymore.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big CNN debate last night. ... You know, last night they tried to make it more interesting. You noticed that?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone talks about this, it was a very weird moment at last night's GOP debate.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;The White House is planning an official state trip to Australia this November, which explains why Biden spent all day looking for an Australian translator.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Obama plans to visit Australia for a trip that has already been canceled twice. I wouldn't be offended, though, Obama's our President, and we're still waiting for him to show up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We begin tonight with an historic event. Last night CNN's Tea Party Republican debate. A truly remarkable pairing as a fringe, often derided incompetent bunch of yahoos was granted legitimacy by pairing with the Tea Party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Still, though, the singing of our national anthem did give the candidates the opportunity to strike a Presidential pose. ... Wow! Look at Rick Perry, man! That's not a candidate, that's a patriotic collectible from the Franklin Mint!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;President Obama has a plan to create jobs: So far, just in the job plan creating industry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;And my guest is former Vice President Al Gore, unless the Supreme Court decides it should be someone else.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;But believe it or not, for the next 14 months, Barack Obama is still the President. Like last week he rubbed it in our faces by calling a joint session of Congress to unveil his new $447 billion American Jobs Act. On Friday, he held rallies to promote the bill. Yesterday he was in the White House Rose Garden to announce that he was sending the bill to Congress and tomorrow he's going to appear live from the Oval Office calling FedEx with a tracking code to find out if anyone in Congress would sign for it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;The President says he's hopeful Congress will pass the bill, which, really? Has he watched the news in the last three years? He'd have better luck getting Jon and Kate back together.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Italy is asking China to help bail them out of their debt crisis. Doesn't that make you mad, huh? Hey, Italy, China is our Sugar Daddy. Get your own. That's right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noting the GOP win in the NY9 special election, &quot;Actually it's a huge story because you realize the Democrats lost a seat they've held in New York since 1920. Political pundits say more than anything, the vote was an anti-Obama vote. But you hear the White House spin, they said at least President Obama created one new job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And former Vice President Dick Cheney appeared on 'The View' yesterday where he was grilled by the women of 'The View.' Which is pretty impressive. He'd be willing to undergo torture himself just to prove a point.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And there was an accident today at the Merck Pharmaceutical Company. A lobbyist stopped short, and Rick Perry broke his nose.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During the debate the other night, Rick Perry denied that he was influenced by a campaign contribution by the drug company. He said he's raised over $30 million. He said, 'And if you're saying I can be bought for $5,000, I'm offended.' That's what he said. Well, now it was revealed that Rick Perry actually took $28,500 from the drug company. So he's right, he can't be bought for $5,000. The number is $28,500. $28,500 is the number.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember last week President Obama said Congress should pass this jobs bill now because it's completely paid for? Now he's saying not quite. Now he's saying it will be paid for by raising taxes over the next 10 years. See, I can't figure President Obama out. I don't know if he's the kind of guy who makes infomercials, or the kind of guy who falls for infomercials.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to 'USA Today' more and more Americans are now seeking job opportunities in Asia. Here's how bad it is. Today in Hong Kong, they said these Americans are willing to do the jobs Asians just won't do. So that's a little too close to home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama's re-election campaign has launched a new contest where contributors can win a chance to have dinner with the President. Yeah. Or if you come in second a mid-afternoon hot pocket with Joe Biden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who else is having a contest? Mitt Romney. His campaign is offering people a chance to win a day with Mitt Romney. It's called vote for Mitt Romney or else you'll have to spend a day with Mitt Romney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday on 'The View,' Dick Cheney was on and he said he doesn't have a problem with gay marriage. Then he brought up Donald Rumsfeld and made a very special announcement. They're honeymooning in an undisclosed location.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of Democrats are blaming President Obama because Republicans just won a Congressional seat in New York. Yeah. But, you know what I say, 'Like the face of a guy who has passed out at a frat party, this has Weiner written all over it.' That's right. Republican Bob Turner won the special election to replace Anthony Weiner. Man, that guy's got some big briefs to fill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;The government's about to release a report on what went wrong during the BP oil spill. Or as fish put it, 'Hey, no rush.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you'll recall, during his time as an elected official accountable to the nation's voters, our Vice President Dick Cheney kept something of a low profile. Staying in undisclosed locations, erasing the Vice Presidential residence from Google Maps, traveling only at night on the new moon at low tide. ... This is really unbelievable. It took a piece of bionic machinery to humanize Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The last time that Ninth District had a Republican Congressman, Harlem Congressman Charlie Rangel hadn't even started his 15th Congressional term yet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Nation, it has been two days since President Obama inflicted his jobs bill on America. Now, I know this plan is terrible, but I also know it's 200 pages long. So I don't know why it's terrible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;President Obama is on the road. He was in Ohio yesterday and North Carolina today. He's there to get support for his American jobs act. Obama is extremely determined to help the unemployed, because it's looking increasingly likely that in a year or so, he's going to be one of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;The President keeps saying that he wants to put construction workers and police officers back to work. But not the way you think. He wants them working in Village People cover bands. He loves the Village People. But he's got quite a job cut out for him. According to a poll released yesterday, a majority of Americans say they don't believe Obama's plan will help lower the unemployment rate. And then they went back to watching 'Price is Right.' If I was President, I would freeze everyone in carbonite until the job market improves. Worked for Han Solo. He had a pilot job when he got out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Elsewhere in politics, disgraced former Congressman Anthony Weiner has officially been replaced. He's been replaced by a Republican. Congressman Weiner, of course, is the guy who resigned after accidentally tweeting an inappropriate photo of himself. A special election was held last night and Bob Turner was chosen to fill Weiner's seat. But not before thoroughly wiping it down.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I got to tell you, I had a horrible nightmare last night. I dream my cat was sick. The only veterinarian in town was Ron Paul. I didn't have my proof of pet insurance card. It was awful!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, I guess you heard by now, in a special election in New York City, Republican Bob Turner won Anthony Weiner's Congressional seat. Weiner couldn't hold on to his seat because, as you know, he was too busy holding on to something else.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, there is a big political scandal brewing here in California. It seems a campaign treasurer who is in charge of the finances of several of our biggest Democratic politicians, including our state Senators, has been arrested for taking all of her client's money. Yeah. And, of course, this has caused a lot of problems. With all of the money gone, the politicians have no idea who paid them off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And NASA now says that bright streak of light seen in the skies over the Southwest United States was a meteor. Witnesses saw that said it dazzled brightly, then it flamed off quickly. Kind of like Obama's Presidency.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, some good news today for President Obama. His approval rating overseas is very high. Right now, he is more popular overseas than he is here. But, then again, he's created more jobs over there. So I guess, that balances it out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Congress now investigating why the Obama Administration invested over $500 million in a solar panel company called Solyndra. Have you heard about this? This company is going broke and has since filed for bankruptcy. So, it's $500 million wasted. See, only the White House could pick a solar panel company that goes broke in California during the summer. ... I don't want to say these solar panels were bad, but they actually absorbed less sunlight than John Boehner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Another Sarah Palin documentary is coming out. ... The man who made the documentary 'Biggie and Tupac' has released a new film about Sarah Palin.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night in the Rose Garden, President Obama had a beer with the Medal of Honor winner. Not to be outdone, Joe Biden had a beer with the 'World of Warcraft' winner. [As Biden] 'You have to tell me how your blood elf got so many conquest points.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;This week, Michele Bachmann and Cindy McCain had dinner together at a Mexican restaurant in Arizona. It wasn't good. First, they sent their entree back to the kitchen. Then they sent the kitchen staff back to Guadalajara.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;On Tuesday, Michelle Obama honored the creator of the Verdana computer font for his life's work. Yep, she also offered the creator of Courier New for making my college essays look two to three pages longer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Folks, I gotta say, I love the American Jobs Act. No, not Obama's bill. That thing is a heat-seeking turd. I am talking about the other American Jobs Act released yesterday by Texas Republican Congressman and tequila worm stunt double Louie Gohmert. You see, despite running around with their hair on fire, the President and the Democrats forgot to file their bill with the House of Representatives. So Gohmert got there first and filed his own bill with the exact same name, The American Jobs Act. That's what political scientists call a parliamentary (bleep ) block. And I gotta tell you I have a copy of it right here. ... Gohmert's American Jobs Act has everything. It includes corporate tax cuts ? and that's it. Gohmert boldly drops corporate tax rates from 35% to 0%. Now, 0% may sound pretty low, but that is still more than GE paid last year.&quot;</SPAN></P>

If a person contributes just $5 to President Obama's re-election campaign, that person will become eligible to win a private dinner with President Obama.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's something exciting. This sounds like 'Star Wars' or something. NASA announced they have found a planet circulating two suns. Did you hear about this?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Obama says his job bill will create 1.9 million jobs and up to 50 of them right here in America. So that's good news.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama said today the odds of him getting reelected are better than the odds of him getting elected in the first place. He said Americans feel things aren't fair, that the deck is stacked against them and that nobody is paying attention. Well, there's an inspiring re-election speech. Remember hope and change? Now we've gone to, nobody's paying attention!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama bought equipment, beer-making equipment with his own money and he brews his own beer in the White House. So, that might explain some of those recent economic policies. He's looking through beer goggles. That's what it is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, more and more information coming out about our other presidential candidates. Like, did you know this? Did you know Mitt Romney's real name is Willard.

Dick felt embarrassment. Yeah, he felt embarrassment. Let's take a look at this, no weapons of mass destruction, wasn't embarrassed about that. Invading the wrong country, no, not embarrassed about that. Shooting a hunting buddy in the face, no, no, not embarrassed about there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and the Iranian president, this guy, and this is why everybody gets excited for the General Assembly. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, do you know that guy, that twerpy little guy, and he likes to get up there at the General Assembly and starts ranting and raving and was bragging earlier today about one thing. Iran now leads the world in captured hikers. Are you aware of that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, Ahmadinejad, and here's a guy who has stated publicly, openly and with a certain measure of pride that he hates Jews and gays. Uh-huh. Boy, is this guy in the wrong town.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top Ten Highlights of Barack Obama's Deficit Plan.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is big news President Obama has proposed a new tax increase called the Buffett Rule. Have you heard about this? At first Newt Gingrich was for it, because he thought it was the buffet rule.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Michelle Obama has convinced the owners of the Olive Garden to cut calories by 20%. Yeah. And they took the First Lady's advice, because Michelle Obama is more Italian than anybody who works at the Olive Garden.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well today, the military's policy of Don't Ask, Don't Tell was officially over. Now, gay couples can enlist, fight overseas, put their lives on the line all to defend people's right to say they can't get married when they get back home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't confuse this with Obama's economic policies. That's 'Don't Ask, I Don't Want to Talk About It.' That's totally different.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama's hometown newspaper, 'The Chicago Tribune,' has called for President Obama not to run for re-election. They've given up on President Obama. Remember, this is the same newspaper that covers the Chicago Cubs. That's a bad sign. One reason why they felt the President should not run again is, they say, the first term of a President is always a lot better than the second term. You know what that means? These are the good ole days.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, President Obama says this new plan to raise taxes on millionaires to shrink the deficit is not class warfare, it's math. Is that a smart thing? We Americans, we hate class warfare, but we hate math even more. That's even harder than class warfare. At least class warfare is easy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not just Obama. Congress' approval rating has dropped to its lowest level ever. 12%. Only 12% of approve of the job Congress is doing. The other 88% are withholding judgment until Congress actually does something.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House is now brewing its own beer. President Obama paid for the equipment, had it brought to the White House. Paid for it with his own money and he makes his own beer at the White House. In fact, they have their own slogan. 'Never fills you up, always lets you down.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's see what the Republicans are up to. It seems there's a long bitter rivalry in Texas, between Rick Perry and George Bush. You know about this? These two guys apparently don't like each other. It has to do with the fact that President Bush went to Yale, and Rick Perry went to Texas A&amp;M. A lot of people think Texas A&amp;M is the school for academic underachievers. How about that, huh? You realize, it's the first time in history anyone's been mad at George Bush for being the smart one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And all these candidates are out there trying to raise money for their campaigns. The one way they do it is product placement. Do you ever notice that? When the candidates give a speech, they stand in front of a building who supports them or a company. Here's an example. Now, here's Rick Perry. See Coca-Cola in the background? Getting some help from them. Mitt Romney. He's the business guy. Look, Staples. See, he's speaking at a Staples. Of course, Michele Bachmann. What product would she represent? Oh, crazy glue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So anyway, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, that beady-eyed little weasel from Iran is in town. And today just for fun he went up to Central Park and arrested hikers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what happened yesterday, in the military they repealed... It's gone forever, 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' is now gone. And that means that homosexual gay people can serve in the military openly and also you know what that means? More parades! Here we go!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So now what that means ? and this shakes up the military chain of command, I had no idea because I'm ignorant. But the military chain of command has now changed. Here's how it works. At the top you have Commander in Chief, Barack Obama, our current President. Next in command, Leon Panetta, always reminds me of pancetta which is mighty tasty. And then after Leon Panetta you have, look, it's Lady Gaga.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But here's the problem, the squeegee guys are back. You know what I'm talking about? Back in the late '60s early '70s the squeegee guys would come... It was because of the economy and they were homeless people and it was a sad, sad thing and they would try to make money by washing your windshield and stuff and they would have a squeegee. ... Well, then Mayor Giuliani came in and said 'no, no' and locked them all up, sent them to prison. And we haven't had squeegee guys ever since. Guess what? They're back because the economy is so lousy. The squeegee guys are back. Now wait a minute, who says Obama isn't creating new jobs, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a guy came up to the car today and was squeegeeing like a bat out of hell. I've never seen a guy squeegee like this before. And you know who it was? It was Anthony Weiner. Honest to God.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top Ten Items on the United Nations General Assembly Agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. Screw with the Swedes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Recap highlights from last night's 'Two and a Half Men.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Goodbye, euro. Hello, Chuck E. Cheese tokens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Pass resolution that Steve Carell 'was robbed' at the Emmys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Gently break it to the Russians that they've been writing their 'R's backwards all these years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Finally nail down which one's Uruguay, which one's Paraguay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Pitch sitcom about Greece and the United States called 'Two Broke Countries.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Do whatever China says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Congratulate whichever country came up with the 'Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' books, 'cause those were awesome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Debate whether to renew the Letterman fatwa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a historic day in our country. We should talk about this. It is official, ladies and gentlemen, as of today, 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell', is no longer in effect. Now, for our military personnel, just a reminder, 'Glee' comes on at 2100 hours.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now gays can openly serve in the military. That's right. I'd like to advise our enemies around the world to put down their arms because we will slap a bitch. We will do it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't know if you heard this, but today, former President Bill Clinton revealed that he turned down an invitation to join 'Dancing with the Stars.' Clinton said he wants to keep himself available for 'The Bachelorette.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a new survey that just came out, one in five Americans believes that God steers the economy. So mystery solved, God is Chinese.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some big political news, you guys. Over the weekend, presidential front runner, Rick Perry came in second place in the California straw poll. Yeah, it's interesting. He lost to 'The Daily Show with Jon Stewart.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;There's a new 24-hour hotline for illegal immigrants who have questions about deportation. I mean, the number's really easy to remember. It's 1-800-TRAP.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, let's begin the night with news from the military. If you're watching this show from a military base and you've noticed that your fellow soldiers seem somewhere between 2% to 10% happier today, the figures are very hard to get. There's a reason.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's how ridiculous this policy was. The apology for the affront is 'All right, sorry, you can go to Afghanistan and fight for your country.' By the way, they're lucky it was gay people that they discharged from the Army. Only gay people would remain in good enough shape to be able to reenlist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Of course, there's one foreigner really robbing America-- Barack Obama. Yesterday Obama unveiled his deficit reduction plan with yet another fiery speech from the Rose Garden. I am beginning to think he has locked himself out of the White House and is afraid to admit he can't find his keys. Folks, you don't to be a rocket scientist to understand that the US needs money. Which is good because we have laid-off all of our rocket scientists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Job creators like me need low taxes so we can continue to create jobs! Just look at history. In 1995, the effective tax rate paid by millionaires was 30.4%. By 2009 it had dropped to 22.4%. And over that same period, unemployment plummeted from 5.6% all the way down to 9.3%.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Folks, I promise, I promise there is more jobs coming! Just be patient. We job creators are like a slot machine. If we just keep pumping in tax cuts, eventually we're going to pay off! You can't quit now, you've got us all warmed up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;We have blood on our hands tonight. Fresh blood, as the first dancer of a new season of 'Dancing with the Stars' has been axed. You know, some of the dancers last night were good but the bad ones were -- I've seen better dancing at the Republican National Convention, let's put it that way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Today was an historic day for the United States military. Last night at midnight, the controversial 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' policy was officially retired, which marks the beginning of a new age of tolerance, acceptance and awkward showering for everyone involved in the military.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;President Obama addresses the General Assembly tomorrow. He's expected to urge the delegates to fight global warming, reduce poverty, and find out what the hell is happening to Netflix.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Anyway some critics are saying Obama shouldn't even be at the UN this week. They say he should be focusing on jobs. But I think it's important Obama meets with other countries. They're the ones who took all our jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Obama's hometown newspaper, 'The Chicago Tribune,' has called for President Obama not to run for re-election. Well, of course he's gonna run, he has to run. He knows more than anyone else, there are no jobs out there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this is frightening. The latest poll shows that Sarah Palin now only trails President Obama by five points. I think Michele Bachmann's getting nervous. Like today she said a woman in the audience told her voting for Sarah Palin can make your child sick. There's no proof.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And on Friday, the Solyndra executives are scheduled to testify before Congress. You know that solar power company that the Obama Administration gave all the money to and then went bankrupt? We're told that when they testify on Friday, they're gonna take the fifth. Why not take the fifth? They already took $535 million.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the Army has done away with 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell.' That's gone. Now gays, of course can now openly serve in the military which is good news, unless you're gay and don't want to go in the military, and they reinstate the draft, then you're screwed. You've got nothing. You've got nothing now!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, here is a milestone in American culture. Gays are now allowed to openly serve in the military. So you know me, I am always thinking you know what that means. Maybe our next war could be a musical.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that Republican presidential campaign? I wouldn't say it's heating up. Have you ever tried to boil water on a stove that doesn't put out much heat? That's kind of like what's happening with the Republican campaign. Taking a long time for it to come to a simmer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know what the Tea Party is up to now? The Tea Party is forming its own debt super committee. A super committee on debt that's going to meet this week at a Florida Denny's. Yeah, trust me; you do not want to be the waiter who has to add the tax to their check. 'I'm sorry, it's mixed in.' 'A Socialist! Socialist!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Hey, listen to this, during a fund-raiser in New York last night, President Obama said he was 'In a New York State of Mind.' Of course, in a year he might be singing that other Billy Joel song, 'Moving Out.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Check this out. In a recent interview, Bill Clinton complimented Hillary by saying he's never met anyone with a better combination of mind and heart. And then he added [as Clinton ] 'Now if we're talking other body parts, I'm going to need my diary.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;A new study found that quitting smoking can actually improve your memory. Which explains why President Obama's finally starting to remember those campaign promises he made.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Monday morning President Obama took to the White House Rose Garden, where appearing in front of the very doorknobs that might be hitting him in the ass next November, he talked death and taxes. ... Let me say this: Barack Obama knows one thing. You can never go wrong appealing to Americans' love of math. Probably something he stole based on the hugely popular online role playing game 'World of Mathcraft.' My character rhombus wears the Pythagoras hat. That's how you're going to sell your program? It's not war, the thing we're best at, it's math, the thing we're 365th in the world at, or as we like to think of it, the top 10%.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;And if Europe collapses, where will college students spend a semester abroad to learn how to throw up sangria in Spanish? Now, the collapse is imminent because once again Greece is in danger of defaulting on their debt. And to save themselves, they have only two options. A., the prime minister can turn Greece's creditors to stone by using medusa's head. Or B., Greece can convince the other European countries that they're getting their financial house in order, but to do that, someone in Greece may have to do the unthinkable -- get a job. Let me explain, Greeks. A job is when you provide a service in exchange for something called money. Ask Italy. Wait, don't ask Italy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Got good news today for a change, for two American hikers who were captured in Iran. Back in 2009, these guys went hiking in Iraq but wandered into rein Iran who held them captive. See this is the reason I don't exercise. Right there. But this is what you get when you book your overseas hiking adventure through GroupOn.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;President Obama has been in New York for the past couple of days speaking at the United Nations. I think the United Nations are great because they make the countries sit in alphabetical order. That means, like, poor Ireland is stuck between Iraq and Israel. ... Obama addressed the General Assembly this morning. He opened with a joke to break the ice. He said, 'The American dollar is strong.' Isn't that good?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;But Obama, on a serious note, spoke about the ongoing problems between Israel and Palestine. Obama suggested instead of focusing on their differences, they should focus on what they have in common, like their natural love of falafel and terrible disco music. I think I can solve this Palestine problem with one word. And that word is timeshare. Now bear with me. Israel gets the land the first six months. Palestinians get it the next six months of the year.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, there was another big Republican debate tonight in Orlando, Florida. This one was sponsored by Google. It was sponsored by Google, which is tricky for Rick Perry. Because, you know, he's a yahoo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, Orlando's the home of Disney World. That's the perfect place for these candidates. Mitt Romney is Prince Charming. Ron Paul is grumpy. Rick Perry's dopey. And Michele Bachmann thinks she's Snow White.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bad day for the stock market. Down nearly 400 points. They're calling it the worst September meltdown since the Red Sox, I guess. Let me sum up the stock market, the S&amp;P is now the WTF. Okay, that's exactly where it's at.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Scary moment at the White House the other day. ... A guy jumps the fence at the White House, starts running up the lawn towards the Oval Office. It turns out it was just Obama's uncle. I guess he found out Obama's making his own beer now, so he made a beeline for that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A happy story. After more than two years in Iranian custody, those two American hikers, finally freed from prison yesterday. Yes. They are out of Iran. They called this the happiest day of their lives. And to celebrate, they'll take a ten-day cruise along the Somali coast.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, US diplomats walked out of the UN General Assembly after Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad attacked the US government as being arrogant and ruled by greed. He has no right to say that, okay. That is Ron Paul's job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you hear about this? Southwest Airlines said someone is painting Arabic symbols on the sides of their airplanes, but they claim it's not a safety issue. Really? Some nut job is close enough to the plane to paint an Arabic symbol on it? Shouldn't that be a red flag, huh? Meanwhile, I'm getting a cavity searched for two ounces of Suave shampoo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Obama, was in town speaking at the UN General Assembly and he is very proud of three things he said in his address to the UN. He said he was very proud of three things: bin Laden dead, yeah, sure. Qaddafi toppled, right? Number three, Regis fired. Very proud.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top Ten Things a Candidate Should Not Say During a Presidential Debate:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. Yeah, I killed a guy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. 'Fifty states? When did Puerto Rico get in?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Can you repeat the question? I was thinking about cookies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. If elected, my Cabinet will feature at least three Kardashians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. I don't know a damn thing about the economy, but I do know this: Chaz Bono dances like an angel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Can anyone beat Angry Birds level 16? I can't kill the pig with the mustache.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. It's-a not so bad, it's-a nice-a place. Ah, shaddap you face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Hey Republican spelled backwards is Nacilbuper</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. As my good friend, Osama bin Laden, once said ?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Senior citizens can bite my ass.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of drama at the UN Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was giving a speech at the United Nations. A lot of delegates stood up and walked out in protest. Which is actually a shame because they walked out just before Ahmadinejad really went off on Netflix.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday President Obama welcomed back the two hikers who had been held captive in Iran. They're back. We welcome them. The President's exact words were, 'Great. Two more Americans that need jobs.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President's busy. He's visiting the hometown of House Speaker John Boehner. Yeah, Obama plans to give a speech. Then visit the tanning bed that Boehner grew up in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Tea Party has been busy. The Tea Party has formed a debt super committee that's going to meet this week at a Florida Denny's. It will be the first time in history someone from Denny's has expressed an interest in trimming fat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I heard that yesterday President Obama arrived 25 minutes late for a luncheon at the UN. In fact, he was so late; he had to sit next to Biden at the kids' table.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;First Lady Michelle Obama will appear on the season premiere of 'Extreme Home Makeover' on Sunday. The good news is she'll be refurbishing a house for a new family to move into. The bad news is it's the White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Some more political news, according to new reports, House Speaker John Boehner has accepted money from BP to support his campaign. While Mitt Romney has accepted oil from BP to support his hair do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;NASA is developing space taxis to shuttle astronauts to the International Space Station. And this is cool, just like New York taxis; they're all going to be driven by aliens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big buzz at the UN today as diplomats look forward to getting home early from work. Picking their children up from school, thanks to the annual Ahmadinejad speech ritual known as the running of the bull [bleep] 'No, honey, I don't know what time I'm going to be coming home. Oh wait, he's denying the Holocaust. Yeah. I'll be coming home right now. I will see you in a little bit.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you may or may not know there has been a slight ongoing property line dispute in the area between what everybody besides Palestine calls Israel and what everybody but Israel calls Palestine. So for I guess around the past 6,000 years, these two parties have attempted to settle the zoning disagreement the old-fashioned way: persistent bloodshed. Since this method has proven somewhat inconclusive the parties from time to time seek an alternative, pardon the pun, unorthodox methods to achieve their goals.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today is the first full day of fall or as the Republican candidates call it, 'The end of global warming!' That was close!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, they had another Republican debate last night in Florida that was sponsored by Google. You know something? I think Google can help us here. We should go on a Google search and see if we can find some better candidates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, since this debate was in Florida, it was tough to get an audience because that's the time 'Wheel of Fortune' is on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The political pundits feel that Rick Perry didn't do very well last night, that he lost the debate. They said he was unprepared, seemed unsure of himself, and stumbled on some of the answers. I would hate to be a death row inmate in Texas waiting to get a call from the governor to get a pardon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Pakistan warned the United States today that if we don't stop the rhetoric toward their country, we will lose an ally. Do you know what that means? Pakistan can end up being an enemy harboring terrorists as opposed to an ally harboring terrorists. That would be terrible. They put the 'lie' in 'ally.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, that satellite that was supposed to hit the earth today? Well, NASA says it will most likely come down sometime tomorrow. But they admit, they have no idea where this six ton satellite will go. They don't know, but in case it did hit somewhere in the United States, the Obama Administration is standing by and ready to blame President Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Are you worried about the big satellite? ... It is plummeting back to earth faster than Michele Bachmann's campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, they had another one of those Republican debates. Do you watch those things? Does anybody watch them? I mean, the election is, like, two years from now. You're probably not going to vote anyway, right? And I don't know. I'm no political expert. I'm no pundit but it seems to me like the Republican field is a little anemic, a little anemic. As a matter of fact, they were watching the debate last night at the Oval Office, at the White House, and Barack Obama's watching the debate and halfway through he turned to his wife and he said, 'Honey, you can stop packing!' Not worried.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what we had going on this week, of course, the UN General Assembly. Anybody go out there for the reopening? The horn section? And I was talking to folks after it closed up. Everybody agrees that this year it just wasn't as much fun without Gadhafi.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, some big weather news. Looks like Tropical Storm Hillary is picking up strength near Mexico. It's expected to turn into a hurricane tonight. When he heard that Hillary was coming, one guy was like [imitating Bill Clinton ] 'Stay indoors and do not talk back. Don't talk back, trust me. You will not like what's about to happen to you.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Yesterday someone smashed the windows in President Obama's LA campaign office. Yeah, today, Joe Biden said it was likely the work of vandals and definitely not someone who forgot their key and had to go to the bathroom. Most likely vandals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;This isn't good. I read yesterday the Mexican peso hit its lowest point since March of 2009. In fact, things got so bad, it was seen leaving a bar with the American dollar. That's not good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;So, election news here. Mitt Romney says he wants Sarah Palin to run for President to make the race more exciting. Although with Mitt Romney running, even Al Gore on Ambien would make the race more exciting.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this is very exciting. President Obama is here in California now. Got here today, very exciting. This morning he was in San Diego, and as a result, traffic was a huge mess. In fact, there was a three-hour delay tunneling in from Mexico just from all the back up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama says he's going to make education a priority. Says he's going to be reforming No Child Left Behind. Now, don't confuse that with the First Lady's program about obesity. That's No Child Left With A Big Behind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well in a stunning upset, Herman Cain won the Florida Republican straw poll beating the front-runners Rick Perry and Mitt Romney. Republicans say this is the guy what can beat President Obama. Plus he's African-American, nobody knows much about him, no political experience to speak of, but he gives a great speech. Beat Barack Obama? He is Barack Obama!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After getting soundly beaten by Herman Cain, political pundits are calling Rick Perry Texas toast. That's what they are calling him in the paper, the Texas Toast. Which pretty much sums up Perry around Romney, toast versus the waffle. What do you like? What do you like? Toast or waffles, figure out which one do you want?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And 'Forbes' magazine has just come out with the annual list of the 400 richest Americans. To show you how bad the economy is, 200 of them have moved back in with their parents.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm telling you, there was another Republican presidential debate. I mean these Republican candidates are busier than a two-headed woodpecker, aren't they? And the most recent one for Rick Perry apparently did not go well. ... Don't kid yourself. Obama watches this stuff; he knows what is going on because these goons are trying to get his job so he knows exactly what is going on. He is watching Rick Perry and Perry is having problems and Obama turns to Michelle and says 'Hey, honey, you can stop packing.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rick Perry says he did not do well because he was exhausted, I thought sure he is exhausted from executing all those people. 'Hey, I got my thing. I have to pull the switch.' Since we started keeping track, when I first was aware Governor Perry had executed 234 people down there in Texas. And now it's jumped to 236 so apparently something's working. And it turns out at least half of them were guilty. So I mean keep up the good work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top Ten Signs That Rick Perry's Campaign Is In Trouble:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. Lost support from both the wack jobs and the nut jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. At debates, he mostly goes with, 'That's what she said.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Downgraded from campaign bus to cheaper campaign Vespa scooter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. He's too Mitty for Newt supporters, too Newty for Mitt supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. His new slogan: 'C'maaaaaaaaaaan!'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Advisors are thinking of replacing him with Luke Perry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Just went hiking on the border of Iraq and Iran.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Even his wife is wearing a Herman Cain button.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Instead of 'freedom' and 'liberty' his cowboy boots now read 'It's' and 'Over.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Even Michele Bachmann thinks he's nuts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama's campaign just launched a new program geared towards seniors called 'Operation Vote.' Just what old people need, another operation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;You guys, there's talk that New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is under a lot of pressure from Republicans to run for President. Yeah, also under a lot of pressure, Chris Christie's belt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congressman Paul, of course, turning in another fine performance last Thursday when the Republican presidential candidates gathered in Florida for the Fox News Google debate. The 83rd such debate so far this year following of course the previous CNN Tea Party debate, the Reagan Library debate, the History Channel Civil War Recreationist debate, the Tron debate. The 'Are You Afraid of the Dark' debate, and the 'Don't Tell Rick Santorum We're Canceling the Debate' debate. By the way, Santorum still came in fifth in that debate. Things aren't going his way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;[On calls for Chris Christie to join the race] You want to add another candidate? It's like the Republican primary is a season of American Idol in reverse. Where every week we just add some other idiot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Whenever the President is here in town the traffic is a nightmare even more than it usually is, but they shut down a bunch of streets. They made thousands of people late for jobs that they don't have.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Exciting couple of days. President Obama was here. He left today, but while he was here, he was pushing his new jobs bill. He claims it will be more successful than his last jobs bill, which only created one job and that went to some guy named Bill.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Obama was criticizing Rick Perry for denying global warming. But, you've got to understand why Rick Perry doesn't take global warming seriously. As Governor of Texas, he's probably fried more people than global warming.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Fox News has confirmed that the New Jersey Governor Chris Christie will not seek the GOP nomination for President. Well, sure, why should you go to Washington, DC, give up all the glamour of Trenton, New Jersey. The fast cars, the women, the lifestyle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congratulations to Republican candidate Herman Cain. He won the Republican straw poll in Florida. You realize Herman Cain had more wins in Florida this year than the Miami Dolphins.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know who the Republicans want as their candidate is the tubby guy across the river, Chris Christie. I mean, talk about tons of fun, here we go. But they're having trouble luring Governor Christie into the presidential race. They've tried everything. They've had phone calls, people have called from -- Republicans tried to get him, please, and I thought 'Have you tried pie?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President's been here. Yesterday in Los Angeles, President Obama was heckled by someone who shouted 'Don't forget medical marijuana.' Yeah. So far the Secret Service has narrowed its list of suspects to everyone in Los Angeles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I heard that CBS is working on a new TV show about a one-term President. Yeah, Obama was like 'Oh, you mean, like, Jimmy Carter or Bush Senior? Oh, I don't like this.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[On the President getting heckled] &quot;It was a little different for the President last night as he held a $250 a person fundraiser at the Hollywood House of Blues. This is the trouble with these Hollywood events. there's always a chance Mel Gibson's going to show up! ... Listen, how bad can the economy be when a nut can spend $250 just to yell [bleep] at the President?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unless the President is using his falling poll numbers to fund raise. Yeah, for $250, you can yell stuff at him. For $500 you can give him the classic psych handshake ... For $2,500 maybe he'll take a picture with you holding his fake birth certificate.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, President Obama was here in Hollywood for a big fundraiser the other night. You know, I noticed the Hollywood crowd, not quite as enamored with President Obama as they were first time around when he was running. Like the last time he was here, he stayed at Steven Spielberg's house. See where he stayed this time? Gary Busey's place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And just days after President Obama demanded action on his jobs bill, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced the Senate would take a week-long vacation. Vacation from what? Don't you have to do something before you go on vacation? I thought they were on vacation!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's right. And on the GOP side of things, Republican presidential hopeful Herman Cain won the Florida straw poll on Saturday, soundly beating Rick Perry. This is big news in the Bible Belt, because now you have Cain and someone who is not Able.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Sarah Palin says she will sue. She will sue the publisher of that controversial new book about her. She says it's junk like this that made her stop reading books years ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a five-year-old girl in Texas, on her first fishing trip ever, hooked a piranha in a lake near Houston. A piranha in Texas. Governor Rick Perry very excited about this. He thinks there will be more green way to execute people. You know, just throw them in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's the Jewish New Year, Rosh Hashanah, and that means just about now, somewhere out on the campaign trail, Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann is mispronouncing Rosh Hashanah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about the Republicans are begging Chris Christie to come and be the President. The Governor of New Jersey. You know what I'm saying? Big guy, big, big guy. And I thought, now, wait a minute. This might make sense. They want him to run in 2012 -- coincidentally, that's his cholesterol. If you elect Chris Christie President, you can say good-bye to pardoning the White House turkey. That ain't going to happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama keeping busy. He has invited the 1985 Chicago bears to the White House. He asked them to bring a 1985 game ball, 1985 uniforms and 1985 economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Marcus Bachmann wrote an open letter to conservatives describing his wife as rock solid. Probably not helping because he then wrote, 'Rock solid as Taylor Lautner's yummy abs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A recent study shows that a typical voting machine can be hacked by anyone with an eighth grade science education. So the good news is, nobody in America will be hacking our voting machines.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During a fund-raiser last night, Joe Biden said that President Obama has 'a backbone like a ramrod.' It was weird. Instead of giving Biden a standing 'O,' the crowd gave him a sitting 'WTF.' Ramrod? Is that a phrase?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Here's some election news. It's rumored that Michele Bachmann's campaign is close to running out of money. When asked for comment, Bachmann was like, 'You see? My campaign really does represent America.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We begin tonight with the Republican field for the presidency, which despite now boasting no fewer than eight viable candidates and Newt Gingrich has still left the Republican base looking for alternatives, but are there alternatives looking for them? It's the subject of tonight's 'Indecision 2012 Indecision Edition'. Chris Christie, New Jersey Governor and part-time Bobby Bacala impersonator spoke last night at the holiest site in Republicanism, the Reagan Library, and was propositioned almost immediately. ... Inscrutable. When urged to run for President, Chris Christie points people to a two-minute montage of unequivocal, 'No, I am not running.' Interpret that for us, oh great political pundits.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin, wearing what appeared to be a vest made from the pelt of a cookie monster she shot from a helicopter, could be found on FOX literally less than a minute after Chris Christie had spoken. Like an alarm went off that they were talking about somebody else. To reassure the nation that not every possible Republican candidate had made a clear decision.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[On Palin's claim that the Presidency would limit her] &quot;You would be the commander-in-chief of history's greatest fighting force. What do you mean? What possibly do you mean? And don't misunderstand; I am not trying to talk you into running. By most people's standards, the Presidency is one of the higher-level positions we have in this country. Perhaps I am not giving your renegade Alaskan bird spirit enough credit. What Palin wisdom would a presidential run silence? I know you're a big deal, you're a former governor and you starred on a show on the same network that has brought us three shows about dwarfs. But, if I may, you spent your summer vacation on a Constitution-wrapped bus that you signed shuttling between Iowa and New Hampshire ... Here's the thing. You could have a colorful bus and drive to early primary states or go around telling people what you would do if you were President, but when you put those two together, there are really only two possibilities. You are either running for President of the United States or you are a crazy person.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Apparently there's a group of politicians, Congressmen, who want to shut down production of the dollar bill and replace it with a dollar coin. They believe that phasing out the paper bill would save hundreds of millions of dollars a year because the dollar coins apparently last longer. But nothing against the dollar coin, I'm sure Sacagawea was a very nice Indian, but I hate this idea. The dollar should be a bill. We need the dollar bill. ... And by the way, if I'm in Congress, I wouldn't go out of my way to put anything that's metal and throwable in the hands of the American public right now.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the other night at a big fund-raiser in West Hollywood, President Obama was heckled by a protester who called him the anti-Christ.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Obama now claims his new jobs bill will be more successful than his last jobs bill. Oh, let's not set that bar too high. Make sure you can reach those dizzying heights.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, this is kind of serious. A Long Island college student faces a year in prison for taking seven high school students' SATs for them for money. For thousands of dollars, he took the tests. See, these kids need to understand, the only place cheating will ever get you in this country, is maybe a high-paying job on Wall Street.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it was this week in 1542, Portuguese explorer Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo arrived in present-day San Diego. He and his men sailed from the port of Navidad, Mexico across the Sea of Cortez, the coast of Baja, California, then journeyed on foot to present-day Tijuana where they began tunneling into America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Obama campaign is trying everything they can to get the voters back. They're offering a chance to win a dinner with President Obama for $3. His campaign slogan: 'Hey, I'm cheaper than Arby's.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is weird. I don't know if you heard this. In a speech yesterday, Michele Bachmann told students that it's ok to settle for cake batter if a local yogurt shop is out of cookies and cream. Yeah, it was in response to the question, 'Can you give us a food-based metaphor that explains your marriage?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;President Obama, our President, is involved in an interesting promotion right now. The campaign is holding a contest and if you donate $5 to his re-election fund, you have a chance to win dinner with him. And at the dinner, the First Lady will come around and personally knock the dessert right out of your mouth. It's a great event. It's all part of the President's plan to get Americans gambling again. But this is kind of funny. I don't know if this is a good sign. Yesterday, they dropped the minimum donation to enter the contest from $5 to $3. The first Presidential Groupon, I guess. $3? How is having dinner with the President cheaper than a Hot Pocket?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Police are looking for vandals who broke into an Obama campaign office. They say it was probably an attack by someone who's angry with the President.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The economy is so bad, the Kansas City Chiefs are now betting against themselves just to get some easy money. That's how bad.

You never see that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, we are learning more and more about these Republican candidates. You know that Mitt Romney speaks French? Did you know that? And Jon Huntsman is fluent in Chinese. He speaks Chinese. See, is that going to help their chances? You know, this is America, okay? You need to speak Spanish. ... In fact, when Michele Bachmann heard they were bilingual, she said, 'Well, just as long as you don't get married. Okay?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Fidel Castro lashed out at President Obama, calling him 'Stupid when it comes to Cuba and US relations.' Oh, yeah. Yeah. That's why 5,000 Cubans volunteered today to swim to America and tell Obama that personally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;US counterterrorism forces today killed two top al-Qaeda leaders, including Anwar al-Alwaki. That's good news. Yeah, yeah? Let me tell something. I tell you, the killing of this guy has really demoralized al-Qaeda. You know? As a result of this, some terrorists are so depressed, they've lost the will to die.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The governor of New Jersey, Governor Chris Christie, he could be our next President. That would be fantastic to have a neighboring state governor become the President of the United States. A lot of people are already criticizing the guy. Don't you hate politics for that reason? I mean, you can't just live and let live. You always have to be on somebody, poking at them, making fun, criticizing them, working them over. They're saying about Chris Christie, they're saying he doesn't have the fire in his belly. That's what they're saying.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And again the critics are all over this guy. They're saying, 'Fine, Governor of New Jersey. I hope he's doing a nice job for folk in the Garden State.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you hear about this story? The police in Massachusetts have arrested a man for allegedly planning to blow up the Pentagon and the capitol by using radio-controlled model airplanes filled with explosives. Is this the best the terrorists have now? They're using toys? What has Wile E. Coyote joined al Qaeda?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and that terrorist that was killed last week, al Awlaki, that guy. He was a top al Qaeda recruiter overseas, and he was American born. That shocked a lot of people. He's an American citizen. You don't often see that, an American taking a foreigner's job. Usually it's the other way around.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Perry, what are you doing? He came under fire this weekend over report that his Texas hunting camp had a racially charged name. They're saying this is the most embarrassing thing for the people of Texas since yesterday's performance by Tony Romo and the Dallas Cowboys. Yeah, not looking good for Perry. In fact, earlier today, Herman Cain said he'd rather go hunting with Dick Cheney than Rick Perry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, we're learning more and more about these Republican candidates. Did you know that Mitt Romney speaks French, did you know that? And Jon Huntsman is fluent in Chinese. And of course, Michele Bachmann was never able to learn a second language thanks to a vaccine she was given against her will as a child.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in China, there's a KFC-type restaurant called OFC with a picture of President Obama as Colonel Sanders. Well, the President has nothing to do with this business. You know how you can tell? It's successful and making money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel awful talking about people when they're not here. But we had an audience last week, oh my God. Dumb and ugly. And mean. The kind of audience that would spend a weekend at Rick Perry's hunting camp. Oh my God.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about this Governor Chris Christie from New Jersey. How exciting it really is well, they're saying now that maybe they'll want him to run for President and how must this make Mitt Romney feel. 'You know, Mitt Romney, you're okay but we're going to try and get somebody better.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Boy, we are getting it done overseas. The US Special Forces bombed and killed the editor of Al Qaeda magazine, did you hear about this? So if your delivery this month is a little late ? &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fox News is 15 years old today and President Obama demanded to see their birth certificate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, congratulations to the Obamas who are celebrating their 19th wedding anniversary today. That's right. They were going to go out to dinner, but they couldn't find a sitter for Biden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, President Obama did take Michelle out to a lovely dinner on Saturday. And this is a little awkward, though. When the bill came, Obama just put it on the tab of the Chinese couple sitting next to them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you guys hear about this? In a new interview, Michele Bachmann said that 'China has blinded US satellites with their lasers,' which explains Michele Bachmann's new campaign adviser, Gary Busey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;A big protest going on called Occupy Wall Street. Hundreds of people have been assembling on Wall Street in New York every day for more than two weeks now. Nobody though seems to be particularly sure what exactly they want. CNN called it a spirited and leaderless demonstration. They seem to believe that Wall Street has too much influence on the government, more than 700 protesters were arrested for blocking cars on the Brooklyn Bridge and, see, to me that makes sense. They say the best way to fight corporate greed is make random people sit in traffic on their way to visit their aunt and uncle in Brooklyn.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Also a great day because happy anniversary to President Obama and the lovely Michelle. They got married in 1992. They had a celebration of the last time someone said yes to an Obama proposal.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the big losers last night, on 'Monday Night Football', the Colts and Hank Williams Jr. ESPN dropped Hank Williams Jr. from the opening of last night's 'Monday Night Football' game after he compared President Obama to Adolf Hitler. Well, you know that means we can wind up with another Republican Presidential candidate. Another guy entering the race.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, remember that big story a couple of weeks ago? This was a huge scandal where they said the government was paying $16 each for muffins. At some sort of government meeting, and the muffins were $16 a piece? That was ridiculous. Well, an investigation by the Justice Department reveals the government did not pay $16 for the muffins. Turns out $16 is what some of the guys paid for a lap dance by a waitress named Muffin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Are you aware of what's going on the political scene locally across the river, Governor of New Jersey Chris Christie? He was going to run for President and today he made it official, he will not be running for President, what about that? You know, I honestly think he made the right decision. Think about it this way. Do we really want a President who looks like an American League umpire?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It would have been a problem if Governor Christie decided he was going to run because the Republicans then would have to choose between Chris Christie and Rick Perry. That's a difficult choice. Chris Christie and Rick Perry. One is morbidly obese and the other one is morally obtuse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Are you folks feeling the economy? It's just gone crazy on us. Here in New York City it's very bad. Unemployment in New York City is like 9.2. I'm telling you, the only thing not going out of business here in New York City right now are the going out of business stores.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's what I like, somebody that doesn't really need to say anything decides they're going to say something and gets themselves in trouble. You know who I'm talking about this time? Hank Williams, Jr. He's the 'Monday Night Football' 'Are you ready for football' guy and here's what he decided he would do yesterday. He decided what he would do is compare president Obama to Hitler. Good idea! Can you really go wrong with that? No! That's kind of your go-to thing, isn't it? I prefer to get my political insights from Rascal Flatts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top Ten Reasons Chris Christie Is Not Running For President</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. As always, he's following his gut</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Wants to spend more time with pie</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Learned there isn't a Quiznos within five miles of the White House</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Afraid of going up against the Newt Gingrich juggernaut</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Doesn't own a tie without a mustard stain</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. He was advised against it by his closest confidant, Duncan Hines</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Constitution requires every candidate be able to see their feet</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Can't understand response because of chewing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Hank Williams Jr. just compared him to Stalin</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. He was born in Kenya.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a new interview, President Obama revealed that Steve Jobs gave him an iPad last year before it was officially released. Unfortunately, it broke when Biden thought it was an etch a sketch and started shaking it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Experts are trying to fire out how millions of Florida's honey bees mysteriously died last week. Yeah, they're also trying to figure out how millions of Florida's residents mysteriously stayed alive last week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So as Republicans absorb the disappointment that Christie is really, truly, unequivocally probably not running and Republicans continue checking underneath every available flag pin and Bible for viable candidates, presumed de facto front-runner candidate Mitt Romney's got to be thinking, 'What the fudge? This is starting to hurt where my feelings should be.' I mean, Romney has been running for President since 2007! Romney's the former governor of the state where the actual tea party happened. He's the son of a popular Midwestern governor. He's rich. He looks like a guy you'd cast as the President in a movie. And not a movie where the President is corrupt or an asteroid is about to hit the earth but more of a light hearted President dad type movie where he commands an army but can't connect with his kids. I mean, the only obstacle to Mitt Romney winning next year's Republican nomination is that up until very, very recently he was antithesis of everything Republicans stand for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But now it's 2011. He's not an irresponsible kid in his mid-50s anymore. He's matured and learned an important lesson about wanting to be elected President. Yes, Mitt Romney has a little bit of a problem, and that's the win to Republican nomination he has to convince Republican voters he's not actually Mitt Romney.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you guys read about this? A new study found that being publicly embarrassed can make people like you more. Which explains Obama's new campaign slogan, 'Barack Obama: I have a third nipple.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, congratulations to Donald Trump who just welcomed his fourth grandchild. That's very cool. Good for him. You could tell it was Trump's grandchild because as soon as it came out, it demanded to see its own birth certificate.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, First Lady Michelle Obama made a surprise visit to the Secret Service headquarters. Michelle was, like, 'You guys are great.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's some election news. The founder of Home Depot announced that he is supporting Mitt Romney for President. Kind of a nice story because Mitt Romney was actually assembled with parts from Home Depot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We begin right here in New York City. There was a march on Wall Street today sponsored by the group Occupy Wall Street and oddly enough Sunny D, for extreme protesters. The Occupy Wall Street movement has basically been a four-week, downtown Manhattan live-in, which has spread to cities all across the country, causing the media to move its coverage dial from blackout to circus. It's too bad those are the only two settings it has. Intrepid reporters from all the major networks and CNN went down to talk with the protesters. Of course, the reporters changed into their undercover '21 Jump Street' outfits. 'What's up, brotesters? Mind if we chilax with you in HD? Because the aspect ratio on the shot's going to be bad ass.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, in the latest CBS News poll, the former Godfather of pizza, the hardest working man in the business has vaulted to a tie for the first place with Mitt Romney at 17%. Cain has picked up all the voters who don't like Romney, used to like Perry and can't have Christie. Republican voters have been reduced to using the same criteria as a 4:00 a.m. barroom pickup. He has a pulse and no visible cold sores.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Sarah Palin today in a written statement to her supporters, said that after much prayer and serious consideration, she has decided not to run for President of the United States. Which is good news for Palin haters. Bad news for the moose population. Wait a minute, are you telling me that driving around the country with a bus with a giant picture of her face next to the Constitution was nothing but a publicity stunt?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, folks, another huge setback for the Obama campaign today. Turns out Sarah Palin, not running for President. Sarah Palin announced in a letter yesterday, she's decided not to run for President. The reason? Couldn't find her birth certificate. She says she can help the country better by not running for office. Today, John McCain said, 'Why didn't you tell me that three years ago?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke told the Congressional committee this week that the economic recovery is close to faltering. Of course, on the bright side, most Americans won't be affected because we had no idea there was a recovery.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The economy is so bad; Conrad Murray can only afford to give his patients Ambien. That's how bad. The economy is so bad, the rich monopoly guy -- he was protesting today on Wall Street. The economy is so bad; Michael Vick started a goldfish fighting ring.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new poll out today shows only 3% of Americans strongly approve of the job Congress is doing. Only 3%. Here's the interesting part. The poll has a margin of error of 4%, okay? That means it's possible that less than no one thinks they're doing a good job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You feel the economy is bad? Do you have any money? You have no money, right? I have no money. Nobody's got any money. The Chinese have a lot of money. Here's how bad things are. In New York City, the economy-- I was in Central Park enjoying my lunch. This is how bad the economy is. I saw pigeons, my hand to God, this is a true story, I saw pigeons feeding old people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But now here's what Sarah Palin says why she won't be running for President. Because she says she can be more effective at getting others elected. That's what she says. That by not running for President, she can be more effective. She can be a force for getting others elected. And I thought well that's true. Because in 2008 she got Obama elected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big political news. Last night, Sarah Palin released a letter announcing that she will not run for President in 2012. Right, Sarah Palin wrote a letter, which explains why her spell check had to be given CPR this morning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin is not running for President, but she says that she will help other candidates get elected. Yeah, those other candidates are named Barack Obama and Joe Biden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is surprising. Former Godfather's Pizza CEO Herman Cain has cut Mitt Romney's lead to five points. Even more impressive, he cut it by slicing vertical, horizontal, and diagonal. Thirty minutes or less.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The suspected Christmas Day underwear bomber is apparently representing himself in court. Yes, he is the first lawyer that actually submits his briefs in his briefs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody that watches the program knows we recently spent time analyzing how Sarah Palin has been traveling the country in a Constitution wrapped bus frequenting early primary states and talking about her plans to save America which suggested two very distinct possibilities. You are either running for President of the United States or you are a crazy person. Well, last night Sarah Palin went on Fox News, bravely sporting a lapel pin that could have easily carried her away in its talons -- to provide the answer. ... So, I'm ready to call it, with 100% of Sarah Palin's reporting in tonight. The winner is crazy person. Crazy person was the obvious front-runner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[On Sarah Palin's bus tour drawing attention away from other candidates] &quot;The worst part isn't she is like a guest at a wedding that shows up wearing a wedding dress but insists, 'Hey, I am not here spoiling your big day, I'm just here to help you get your message out about fidelity. Oh, and if you don't mind, I have some vows I want to read, it won't take a minute.' You know, it's not that. For the most part her narcissism is victimless crime, except for this: Two weeks ago Palin supporters got a letter from SarahPAC curiously specific about its purpose. 'As you know, Governor Palin is on the verge of making her decision of whether or not to run for office. Someone must save our nation from the road to European socialism; do you think it should be Governor Palin? If so, can you send your best one time gift to SarahPAC and show her we support her if she decides to run.' So everyone, let me translate that, if you want Tinkerbell to live, clap harder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, it is clear who is to blame for taking Sarah away from us. Her so-called supporters. You did not give her enough money. She gave you plenty of chances. Just a couple of weeks ago SarahPAC was sending supporters a desperate cry to help her. Quote, 'Someone must save our nation from the road to European socialism. Do you think it should be Governor Palin? If so, you can send your best one time gift to SarahPAC today, to show her we support her if she decides to run.' You clearly did not clap enough money at her and now Governor Tinkerbell is dead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All she's got left in SarahPAC is $1.4 million. How what is she supposed to do with that now. Spend it on herself? She can? Well then she should. She deserves it. Maybe a little retail therapy. Buy herself a nice dress, or perhaps a former aide's silence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, I've done something I thought was impossible. I have hurt Karl Rove. Legends say you need an Elvish blade to do that. Which-- which I happen to have. Let me explain. Karl is upset about last Thursday's Colbert report in which I discuss his two political action groups. American Crossroads, which can receive unlimited money but has to disclose the names of its donors. And Crossroads GPS which is called a 501 C-4 and which can also collect unlimited money and doesn't have to disclose any its donors. So I decided to copy Karl and form my own 501 C-4, Colbert SuperPAC SHH. Folks, I thought he would be flattered. It's not like I copy everything Karl does. Other than that one time when we were roommates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now in that same show I also said Karl Rove's head looks like a ham loaf with glasses. And if you eat that ham, you gain rogue's memories. I would apologize for that too, but since they don't mention it in the e-mail I assume they agree.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, Happy Columbus Day, everybody. As you know, Columbus discovered America while trying to find a shorter route to India. You know why he was trying to get to India? Tech support, tech support. There were no phones back then. You actually had to bring your computer to India.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, although he was Italian, Columbus was commissioned by Spain and declared America for Spain. Did you know that? See, if the British never came here, we'd all be speaking Spanish right now, as opposed to just half the country speaking Spanish right now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And because of the holiday, all the banks were closed and I understand some of them are expected to reopen tomorrow. But don't worry, even though the banks were closed, B of A will still charge you the $5 debit fee.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The stock market skyrocketed today. See what happens when the banks and the Federal government shuts down for a day? Good things happen!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And two Americans won the Nobel Prize today for economics. You know, how crappy is the economy in the rest of the world if America is winning the Nobel Prize for economics? I don't know who the two guys were that won, but I think we can rule out President Obama and Timothy Geithner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Rick Perry supporters are now saying the reason he did so badly in the debate is he had back pain. That's why. Back pain. You would think with all the money he got from those drug companies, they could have slipped him a little something.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And homophobic Republican presidential candidate, Rick Santorum, he's at it again. He was on Fox News, he attacked gay men and said letting them shower with straight men in the military would cause problems. You know, if that's true, that means the straight men, they weren't that straight to begin with.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Researchers in England say that they will soon have a pill available that can erase all painful memories. In fact, they are already testing it right now on people who voted for President Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today is Columbus Day. ... Columbus, of course, an Italian, moved to Spain and then discovered America. Although many Americans believe that he was actually born in Kenya.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rick Perry, Rick 'Gunner' Perry from Texas has admitted now what I have worried about, well, for like 10, 20 years. These people are exhausted. He claims he is so tired he can't sleep. He's having trouble sleeping. And I thought yes, of course, I mean honest to God, you know, if you are having trouble sleeping just listen to one of your speeches. And it's starting to interfere with his life. He's so tired. He can't get to sleep. When he finally gets to sleep, he overslept. You ever do that. You oversleep, you miss an execution.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An report by the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles shows that there are fewer bad drivers, and they said that's because the bad economy is keeping people from spending time on the road.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At tonight's Republican debate, former Godfather's Pizza CEO, Herman Cain, was given the center seat.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Coming into tonight's debate, former Godfather's Pizza CEO Herman Cain was in second place in the national polls behind Mitt Romney. Apparently his message of less government, more toppings is really resonating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;The sponsors of tonight's debate based the arrangement of where candidates sat on their poll numbers.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you heard about this terrorist plot by the Iranian government? Iran was going to use members of a Mexican drug cartel to kill the Saudi Arabian ambassador on US soil. Now, they didn't want to use Mexican hit men, but they were willing to work for half the price of the Americans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This shows you how connected the world is. I mean, when Iranian agents talk to the Mexican cartel about assassinating a Saudi ambassador on US soil in a French restaurant in order to undermine an American President whose father was from Kenya and whose mother was from Kansas, you can't get more international than that. The whole world is connected.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Chris Christie has officially endorsed Mitt Romney for President. In a speech yesterday, Chris Christie said 'President Obama is shrinking the American pie.' And believe me, if there's one thing Chris Christie hates, it's a small pie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Rick Perry's advisers said he prepared for last night's debate by getting a lot more sleep. The bad news, apparently he did it during the debates. Did you see him? Nothing. Nothing. Oh, and at one point, Rick Santorum was interrupted by a gay heckler. Then, Michele Bachmann told her husband, 'Look, just shut up, and sit down.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And China's top economic expert says China is now facing a financial crisis. There are already signs of trouble. For example, unemployment rate in China is a staggering 12% among 3-year-olds. Did you know that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, you visit New York City, you go down to Wall Street. Have you seen the protesters down there? Any Wall Street protesters? I finally figured out what the deal is. They're after rich people. They don't like rich people and people with money are scared silly. As a matter of fact, you know Regis Philbin, Regis has all the money, you know, on his program today he was using Kelly as a human shield. And Mayor Bloomberg, New York City, guy's got a lot of dough, lot of dough, scared silly. They found him hiding in his briefcase.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our guest tonight, President Bill Clinton is on the program. Very popular President here in the United States. And I was thinking about this, President Clinton is maybe something we'll never see again, a two-term Democrat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is kind of sad. They are saying how that President Obama doesn't have any friends, has no close friends. And he says he's aware of this, but the problem is he can't get Congress to approve one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody see the Republican presidential debate last night on the Bloomberg news? Well, they switched up the format a little bit and the candidates got to ask questions, and Jon Huntsman his question was, 'Who am I?' ... : And Rick Perry had to leave the debate early. He was late for an execution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top Ten Reasons Chris Christie Endorsed Mitt Romney</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. Romney sounds like pastrami</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9 Perry wouldn't let him fry eggs on the Texas electric chair</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8 Two liters of Shop Rite root beer and a king size snickers did the trick</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7 If elected, Romney said he'd overturn rule requiring enormous people to buy extra airplane seat</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6 Needed something to do between lunch and second lunch</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5 Acting on direct orders from Colonel Sanders</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. It was a close call between him and Rick Santorum ? just kidding</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Mistook Mitt's repeated 'bi-partisan' references to mean two kinds of cheese</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Movie star good looks, who could resist?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Only other options were the nut job, the crackpot, the pizza dude and Newt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday President Obama had beer with four unemployed construction workers. And Obama asked the guys, what was it like to lose their jobs? They were like, 'Oh, you'll see.' When the check came, Obama was like, 'So, do you guys want to split this five ways? Credit card roulette?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During the Republican debate last night, Michele Bachmann said that she has 28 children. Five of her own and 23 foster kids. It's all part of her new election strategy, adopting a majority of voters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;President Obama got some bad news last night, which it seems like he gets every night now. The Senate voted not to pass the American Jobs Act he had been going around the country promoting. Don't you get it, Mr. President? This is a country with 12 'Real Housewives' shows on. We don't want to work. We don't have time. His Republican opponents say they do care about putting Americans back to work. They just don't care as much as they care about Americans blaming Obama for not being put back to work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Going into the debate, former Godfather's CEO Herman Cain was in second place, but after last night, he's now in first ahead of Mitt Romney. And a poll now has the former pizza executive in the lead with 27% of the popular vote. I would love to have a President that smells like pepperoni. People seem to be interested in this 9-9-9 plan he keeps talking about. Either he or his opponents mentioned it 25 times during the debate last night. I'm not kidding. Many of the other candidates attacked the plan including Michele Bachmann who pointed out that if you flip the numbers 9-9-9 upside down, it turns into 6-6-6, the mark of the devil. She did. That's what I look for in a President. The ability to imagine what would happen if you flipped things upside down. Might be time to flip Michele Bachmann upside down. Get some blood flowing to the brain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;After the debate last night, Texas Governor Rick Perry spoke at a fraternity house at Dartmouth, where he said the Revolutionary War took place in the 16th century. It took place in the 18th century. Which means he's either bad at history or math. But he was supposedly so embarrassed, he wanted to crawl under a racist rock and hide there. You know what, let me tell you something. I don't know when the lamestream media got the idea they get to decide what's right and wrong with history. If he thinks the Revolutionary War happened in the 16th century that's his opinion. We weren't there.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, I'm sure you heard about this story. US agents have disrupted a plot by Iran to assassinate the Saudi Arabian ambassador on American soil. President Obama is pretty upset about this. He said he will impose sanctions on them. In fact, he's got a full-proof plan to cripple their economy. He's going to send over Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Saudi government, oh, man, they're also upset about this plot to assassinate their ambassador. As you know, Saudi Arabia condemns all acts of terrorism, unless, of course, they're sponsoring them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, as you know, the Republicans had yet another debate the other night. This is their seventh one. They're apparently going to keep having these debates until Rick Perry can get one right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And former Godfather Pizza CEO Herman Cain is surging in the polls. Many polls have him ahead of Mitt Romney. Now, he hasn't said who he would choose as his running mate yet, but according to a report, he's had several meetings with Papa John's.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Obama's jobs bill got blocked in the Senate the other day. He told the Florida audience that's okay because he's a fourth quarter player. He said, 'It's late in the third quarter, but he doesn't miss his shots in the fourth quarter.' The only problem, he's down 14 trillion, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley announced he'll be leaving the White House after the election. I get the feeling a lot of people are going to be leaving the White House after the election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who was in town yesterday visiting with Donald Trump? It was Minnesota Republican hopeful presidential hopeful Michele Bachmann. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You like Mitt Romney? This guy looks like if the Canadians got together and made a movie about the President, Mitt Romney would play the President in a Canadian movie.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now the Republicans will be debating in Las Vegas. And they're all out there getting ready now. Did you hear what happened this morning? Crazy.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. They got more hookers here than a congressional Christmas party</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House is apparently pushing to create more Latino-themed landmarks. Now, that's in addition to our current Latino-themed landmark -- California.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You guys, I read that government officials are trying to force cereals to get rid of cartoon mascots because they target children. Which explains why the new slogan for Trix's cereal is, 'Silly rabbit, Trix are for moderate consumption by responsible adult figures.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;The Occupy Wall Street protests continued in New York City today. The protests have been going on for four weeks now. That's longer than most NBC sitcoms last. That's impressive. The protesters have been gathered in Zuccotti Park in New York. Yesterday, the mayor asked them to leave the park so they could clean. By the way, you know you haven't bathed in awhile when you are asked to leave a park so they can clean it. The protesters are afraid this might be a trick designed to get them out of the park permanently so they have offered to just clean it themselves. They are asking for donations of brooms, mops, dust bans, garbage bags, all of which they plan to turn into hash pipes and bongo drums.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain has come out of nowhere to become the new front-runner. And believe me, Mitt Romney is worried. Oh, my God. He's sweating like Rick Perry on 'Jeopardy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even though Cain is the front-runner the Republican candidates are still looking for ways to stop Romney. See, it's hard to disagree with his positions because as you know he's taken every position. So you really can't disagree.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, now that Rick Perry has dropped back to fourth place, his wife is speaking out. She says he's being brutalized and attacked because of his religious faith. That's what she said. She says Rick Perry's decision to run was like a message from God. She said it was like the burning bush. And you know something, she might be right. She might be right. If you remember your Bible, Moses stammered, wandered for years, and never reached the promised land. That sounds like Rick Perry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't want to imply that Rick Perry isn't too smart or anything. But, there's talk once this campaign is over he's going to begin a reality show called 'Rick Perry's Alaska.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, on the 'Today' show this week, Joe Biden once again denied stories that he will be replaced on the ticket in 2012. He says he will continue to embarrass President Obama for another four years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republican Florida state representative, a guy named Brad Drake, wants to bring back the electric chair to Florida. In fact, you know what chair most people die in Florida? The la-z-boy recliner. That is the death chair in Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you may have heard, the United States has called for more trade sanctions against Iran. Oh, like that's going to scare them. We don't trade anything with them now. Do we? What are you going to do? Threaten not to sell them any more American flags to burn? Ooh.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Michele Bachmann, to tell you how fickle politics are, she started out as the front-runner, and then Mitt Romney, and Newt Gingrich. [As Gingrich] 'Hey, it's a revolving account at Tiffany's. That's all I can tell you.' And so she was-- and now she's not the front-runner. So when you're in trouble like that, as so many people do, they come to New York City to visit Donald Trump. Donald Trump. I said, 'Wait a minute. There's a crack pot's convention? What is it? What the hell is going on? So they met, Trump and Michele Bachmann and he was confused and he looked at her and he said, 'You're fired!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you like Mitt Romney? Do you know who I'm talking about when I say Mitt Romney? Do you like presidential trivia? If he is elected President of the United States, he will be the first President named Mitt. You can look that up. But ? and I didn't want to say this and I've been keeping my eye on the guy even his advisers tell me that he's a little dull. Mitt Romney, you have seen the guy, just a little dull, a little boring. He looks like the crooked banker on a soap opera. Even in high school he was dull. His nickname ? listen to this, his nickname in high school was 'Nickname to Come.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know anything about Herman Cain? Nobody does. He's a pizza baron, owns a pizza thing around the world and has millions and millions of dollars. He's the only one of these goons with an economic plan. It is the 9-9-9 plan. He said if you support it, starting today, if you buy into his 9-9-9 plan, he'll throw in a free 32-ounce soda.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about bronco Rick Perry running for President. That guy, huh? I never heard this before. I heard a lot of things in politics and we've seen a lot of odd things, Rick Perry is the first potential candidate I've ever heard say he's not doing well because he's sleepy. Yeah, so when you go into the poll place you vote for the sleepy one. Who is the guy that needs a nap? Oh, yeah, there you go. He said he's not doing well because he's sleepy. We criticize George W. Bush a lot, and maybe unfairly. I'll tell you one thing he was very disciplined about was getting his eight years of sleep.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Telemundo is going to make history. It will host its first ever Republican presidential debate. Yeah. This could be nice. The Republican candidates will take questions from journalists and then have them deported.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ok. Everyone's talking about Herman Cain. That's the true part. Haven't gotten to the joke yet. Former Godfather's Pizza CEO Herman Cain said it's was a sign that he should run for President when after a surgery his scar was in the shape of the letter 'J' for Jesus. When asked for comment, Jesus said, 'Actually the 'J' is for 'Just stick to making pizza.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Occupy Wall Street's been getting a lot of attention. And it's been reported that it has now raised more than $300,000. Which means, which means technically now they have to protest themselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When we were last on the air, the protest known as Occupy Wall Street were in their infancy. ... They have $300,000? All right. You better change the title of the protest. I'm kidding. I'm sure the money is, you know, is in no way going to go to their head. They got a butler? Son of a [bleep] 'Sir, your hash, sir.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is on the road, he's having some difficulties. Yesterday his teleprompter was stolen. His teleprompter that he reads for speeches was stolen.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made an unannounced visit to Libya.

I'm sorry.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Another Republican debate this evening. I'm just going to feed off your enthusiasm now. The Republican candidates debated in Las Vegas tonight. Yeah. Michele Bachmann said she hadn't been to Vegas since her husband Marcus did a show there with white tigers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, as it turns out, on a Venn diagram, the group of Americans that Republicans say it's not only okay but necessary to pit Americans against matches up pretty well with the list of people who don't vote Republican. Actually, there's only really one sliver of people there that Republicans hate but still vote Republican. Can we zoom in on that and see who that is? Oh, Mitt Romney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, thanks to the lockout, there might not be a basketball season this year. But if you want to watch millionaires throwing elbows, there's still the Republican presidential race. And, folks, it is action-packed. First Bachmann was up; then she was down. Then Perry was up; then he was down. Then Jon Huntsman also existed. So many characters, so many twists it's like a Mexican telenovella that wants to deport itself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>

Yeah, the bowl sells for $3.99 containing 700 calories and is now the Republican frontrunner for President. Yes. USA, USA! I think most of us would vote for that for President.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You paying attention to Occupy Wall Street? Yeah. Earlier this week a protester at Occupy Wall Street proposed to his girlfriend. Yeah, his exact words were, 'Will you occupy my parents' basement with me until I get a job?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night was the eighth and in no way final Republican presidential debate, sponsored by the Western Republican Leadership Conference and CNN. ... The whole gang was there except Jon Huntsman, so who cares? Congresswoman Michele Bachmann, who having apparently untangled the arms of her straitjacket set out to show that even in a tight field no one puts crazy in a corner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But of course Romney is the front-runner. Here he is defending Romneycare, which, as you know, is identical to, but in no way has anything to do with Obamacare. ... So to summarize Romneycare: It's a great Republican idea that works great. The people of Massachusetts love it. I would never do it again. It's socialism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it was here, ladies and gentlemen, around minute 58 of the eighth Republican presidential debate, that Willard Mitt Romney was explaining why it was that he no longer allowed illegal immigrants the privilege of mowing his lawn that he gave away what we in the business call 'the game.' ... [as Romney] 'Believe me, if I wasn't running for office, I wouldn't give a flying [bleep] believe me. Pay 'em $2 an hour. It's not a principle. I got people watching me.' Mitt, if I may give you a piece of campaign advice, there is no story that makes you look good that involves you saying, 'I'm running for office, for Pete's sake.' ... Seriously, that 'For Pete's sake I'm running for office' may be the most honest thing Mitt Romney has ever said, because I'm absolutely sure that's what he was thinking at that time. For just a moment it felt like the guard dropped and we all got to see the tiny human being that resides inside the skull of his giant robot body.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, there was another Republican debate last night, which caught me by surprise because I was not aware that the previous debate had ended.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wall Street, may I remind you, Wall Street has not cratered our economy in like two years. That's ancient history. At this point who can even remember who took workless sub-prime mortgages and knowingly bundled them as mortgage derivatives so they could be sold, re-bundled and resold to pension funds and banks around the world until things inevitably collapsed, annihilating $17 trillion, national economies, centuries old financial institutions and the lives of untold millions of Americans. I can't remember, and neither can Herman Cain. So suck it up, unemployed. It is your own damn fault that you don't have a job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, folks, we all know, countries without environmental regulations are killing us in the job market. Just look at China. It's in there someplace. China is the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gasses, and it only has 4.1% unemployment. Plus thanks to mercury poisoning and factory suicides, positions are opening up all the time. Now, folks, I have always, and this is well-known, I have always despised the jack-booted Birkenstocks over at the EPA. Ever since it was created by that bleeding-heart liberal Richard Nixon. Get haircut, hippie. Of course, the agency was formed back in 1970. Back then America's ecosystem was full of hazardous CFCs, DDTs and three Bee Gees, and Ohio's Cuyahoga River was so polluted it caught fire 11 times. Who knows what caused that? It could have been pollution. Personally I suspect the trout torched it for the insurance money.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi is dead. That's the big story. Huge. Even more shocking, did you hear this? He was killed by an escaped tiger from Ohio. No one saw that coming.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;ABC News reports that Moammar Gadhafi had a crush on Condoleeza Rice and even dedicated a photo album exclusively to her. Rice told him she was flattered but she's trying to work things out with Kim Jong Il.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Herman Cain said that he has the greatest admiration for Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich. So that was nice. The former pizza executive said he respects Mitt Romney as a businessman and Newt Gingrich as a customer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[On the death of Moammar Gadhafi] &quot;You know why they shot him after he said, 'Don't shoot!' They're rebels. 'Hey, man, don't tell us what to do.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All right. So where did they finally catch Gadhafi, it's been months, a safe house, a secret palace, a Bond-villain like bunker? ... Really? A hole? Sounds like it's time for another one of my periodic segments where I give advice to dictators. Hey, dictators, what's up? Oh, is that new wallpaper in the rape room? Anyhow, hey, listen, at some point the people that you have kept under your thumb for however many years are going to turn around and try to hunt you down. And at that point you may find yourself with the urge to hide in a hole. But unless you're the Road Runner...I would resist hidey holing. Because at some point the angry guys with the guns, they check in the holes. You're welcome. Words to live by.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course in Libya the news was met with no less astonishment but understandably less restraint. The celebratory shooting of the guns, the chanting of the victory slogans, and of course is that gentleman throwing a baby in the air? 'The dictator is dead! Finally the law against throwing babies has been repealed! Whee!' I never thought I without say this but take that baby from that man and give him an AK-47.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This morning rebels seized control of the Gadhafi stronghold of Sirte where they captured and killed Gadhafi ending his brutal 42 year reign. Now in hindsight it may have been a mistake for him to hire bodyguards based on their hotness.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gadhafi's death was difficult to confirm since every living picture of him could be confused for a death photo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, I am especially excited this war is over because it means we get to pick the next war! I wonder who it's going to be. If we follow our standard war predictor, it's whoever we were propping up ten years ago. So start digging your spider hole, Tony Blair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm giving a big tip of my hat to the Tea Party Nation. On Tuesday the for-profit grassroots group emailed all 30,000 of its members asking them to take the following pledge: 'I, an American small business owner, part of the class that produces the vast majority of real wealth-producing jobs in this country, hereby resolve that I will not hire a single person until this war against business and my country is stopped.' Amen. Folks, with Americans hurting, something must be done. That that something, nothing. But sadly, nothing may not be enough. To ensure Obama's defeat I call on all Americans, not only not to hire each other, but to actively drive the economy off a cliff where it will plunge down to the canyon floor of liberty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can say what you want about Gadhafi. Really, say what you want, because he can't hear you. For a dictator, he was fashionably dressed. Iran's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad wears a Members Only jacket.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They said it was pretty brutal. They said that Gadhafi was beaten then shot in the head. Then thrown in a meat locker. That doesn't sound like Libya. That sounds more like New Jersey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The guy who killed Gadhafi was wearing a New York Yankees cap at the time. So, for at least one Yankee fan, it turned out to be a pretty darned good October.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm very excited that President Obama's coming tomorrow night and as you know he's on his nationwide 'I Whacked Another Terrorist Tour'. Right after he leaves us he's going over to ABC where he's competing on 'Dancing with the Stars.' He's covering all of the bases.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now President Obama's campaign for re-election has so far raised over $70 million. Well listen to this. Donors who give $10,000 get to have dinner with Vice President Joe Biden and those that give $20,000 just get the dinner. So there's really is an advantage. You want to give a little extra. You want to avoid that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rick Santorum says if elected President he will take away all Federal funding for contraception because contraception is just a license to do sexual things. See, I had no idea you needed a license. ... How many guys are still on their learner's permit?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rick Santorum says he wants all sex to be married and special. Hey, Rick, make up your mind. Which is it, married or special? You can't have it both ways!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Rick Perry says he wants to return America to the good to old days. You know like eight weeks ago when he was ahead in the polls. Those were the good old days.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Perry has finally unveiled his economic plan that includes expanding oil and gas exploration which he claims will creates 1.2 million jobs. Mostly from cleaning up the spills from expanding oil and gas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In 'Parade' magazine, Rick Perry said after meeting with Donald Trump he now wasn't sure that Obama's birth certificate is real. Let me tell you something if Perry is taking advice from Donald Trump, I'm not sure if his high school diploma is real.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Boy, that Gadhafi thing, it's kind of exciting, isn't it? And you know now people, and I don't know who these people are, they are saying well, he was executed without a trial. Oh. What will we do now? Governor of Texas Rick Perry said 'Hell, I've been doing that for years!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rick Perry wants to be the Republican nominee for President. He's now saying he thinks that Barack Obama's birth certificate is fake. I mean let's face it, it always works. Genius strategy, isn't it? You know, I'd like to get a good look at his driver's license. I think he may have faked his driver's license.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The guy they think who actually shot Moammar was wearing a Yankee's cap. Seems about right, doesn't it? If he'd been wearing a Boston Red Sox cap he probably would have missed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top Ten Things Gadhafi Wants To Say From Hell</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. Can anyone recommend a good heat resistant hair gel?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Tweet me if Chaz wins 'Dancing with the Stars'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. How is it that everything is hot down here except the [bleep] damn coffee?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Remember folks, when you want a long-lasting fire with that great smoky taste, buy Kingsford, the official charcoal of Hell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. How did the Colts do last night?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Why is Jack Lalanne here?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Yes, it's hot. But it's a dry heat</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. If you think it's hot down here, wait 'til you see the sizzling Salma Hayek on Letterman tonight</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Homicidal reign of terror? For that you go to hell?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Osama says 'Hello.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, a lot of news about Moammar Gadhafi. Towards the end, 'The New York Times' reports that Moammar Gadhafi spent his last days hovering between defiance and delusion, surviving on rice and pasta. Yeah. In other words, Gadhafi spent his last days as a sophomore in college.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, this is the craziest story, but out's true. It's been found that a sitcom from the 1980's accurately guessed the year of Gadhafi's death. Yeah. So now the only question is who tipped off Mr. Belvedere?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A bank in Washington was robbed by two men in George W. Bush masks. Yeah. Luckily right afterwards two guys in Obama masks came and bailed the bank out, so everything is fine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of President Obama, President Obama was back in Los Angeles today, where he will appear on the 'Tonight Show with Jay Leno.' Obama is appearing with Jay Leno to highlight the one job that was saved during his Administration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, President Obama went to Las Vegas for a campaign fund-raiser. He spent most of the time on the visit working on his new economic recovery plan. 'Come on, seven. Let's go. Come on, we can do this!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday on CNN, Joe Biden said he hasn't made up his mind about whether he'll run for President in 2016. Which raises the question, who is raising that question?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Perry has picked up the cold, flameless torch even Donald Trump dropped six months ago that suggests perhaps none of us have seen the President's real birth certificate. This represents progress for Perry. Right now he's only six months behind the national conversation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[On the troop withdrawal from Iraq] &quot;Different people have different reasons for disliking Obama's radical decision to do the thing George Bush signed an agreement to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight's show is historic as always. We have got presidential candidate Jon Huntsman, a new poll places him among the top two Mormons in the Republican presidential race.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;President Obama visited Los Angeles tonight. I don't get that. There's got to be an easier way for the President of the United States to get medical marijuana than to fly all the way out to California.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are very excited. The President of the United States is here tonight. We're very excited about that. Just a quick note. The guy outside patting everybody down before you come in to see the President. He's not the Secret Service, he just hangs around here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, the President is here in LA. He's raising money for a huge disaster relief project. It's called NBC. We can't let another corporation go under.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, it feels weird, because we're taping the show extra-early tonight. It's rare we change what time we tape the show to accommodate a guest's schedule. In fact the only people we've ever done it for are the President and Lindsay Lohan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Libyan rebel has admitted to killing Gadhafi. He said he shot Gadhafi twice in the temple, to which Michele Bachmann said, 'I didn't even know the guy was Jewish. That's amazing to me.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, actually up until today, Gadhafi's body was on view at the mall in Libya. And listen to this, in November; he's coming to the Century City Mall and then the Glendale Galleria, right down here, so it's going to be quite a tour.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, they say Moammar Gadhafi may have been one of the richest men in the world. $200 billion dollars. Yeah, with all the billions he had, he spent very little on education or healthcare for his country. So I guess he was a Republican.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, earlier today, Rick Perry unveiled his new tax plan. He says he wants a flat tax. He believes that tax should be flat, just like the earth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an interview with 'Parade' magazine Rick Perry says after meeting with Donald Trump -- and there's a meeting of the minds right there -- he said he isn't sure if Obama's birth certificate is real. He said there is room for debate. The good news? Perry loses every debate he's been involved in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And listen to this. Here's your government at work. The US Senate now working hard on a bill to put anyone who sells fake maple syrup in prison for five years. So it's good to see we have our priorities straight. You sell worthless stocks and mortgages to innocent consumers, you get a Federal bailout. Fake Mrs. Butterworth? 'Come on, buddy! Let's go!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Talks between the NBA owners and the players have broken off again, canceling another two weeks of the season. Another two weeks are being cancelled. Some are calling this a battle between millionaires and billionaires. Or as Republicans call that, class warfare. 'It's Obama's fault!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, they're talking about pulling all of the troops out of Iraq. That would be good, huh? I think they're talking about by the first of the year, something like that. But Obama's critics, critics of the President are saying if we do that, if we bring all of the United States troops home from Iraq that Iraq will descend into chaos. And I thought, 'Well, that's got to be an improvement.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Rick Perry. Rick 'Shoot 'Em Up' Perry, he started out like a ball of fire from Texas and then he started to drop and now he's retooling. He's adding advisors to his campaign team. This guy had advisors? Really? Advisors? He's got his new tax plan. Here's his new tax plan. He said he puts it on a 5 x 7 card, that's all it is, very simple and he's going lower taxes for the wealthy. That's his new plan. Lower taxes for the wealthy. Yeah, now here's a guy who could read the mood of the nation, you know? The wealthy! 'Yeah, I wish the wealthy were wealthier! Let's lower their taxes.' Good idea, Rick. And then Rick Perry accused Mitt Romney of hiring illegal aliens to work on his hair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top Ten Details Of Rick Perry's Tax Plan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. Fifty percent tax increase for all guy's named 'Mitt'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Hunting camps with offensive names are tax exempt</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. It's covered in rib sauce</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Let's people choose regular tax, flat tax or 'el muy caliente'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. It's called the 9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9 plan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The obese pay an additional 3% per chin</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Free dance lessons</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Not sure, honestly when this guy speaks I have no idea what the hell he's talking about</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. All tax refunds now go directly to the Chinese</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Punishment for filing late? Lethal injection.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Herman Cain and Newt Gingrich said that next month they're going to take part in a series of Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas style debates. The only similarity to the Lincoln-Douglas debates is that no one will watch them on television.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Michele Bachmann's campaign is in trouble. The five staffers who quit her campaign said they did so because she treated them like second-class citizens. However Bachmann said, 'That's not true. At no time did I treat them like gays or Latinos.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Man, these Republican debates just keep on coming, you guys. A group called the Texas Tea Party Patriots is hosting a debate next month where Newt Gingrich and Herman Cain will go head to head. While people watching that will go head to pillow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New Jersey Governor Chris Christie announced that he will visit Israel next year. Yep, Christie hopes to visit the site of the Last Supper. You know, see if there's any leftovers. 'You gonna finish that, Paul? Peter?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama just launched his own blog on the website Tumblr. Incidentally, tumblr is what you call President Obama after looking at his poll numbers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's begin tonight with the Republican Party and another installment of 'Indecision 2012: The Great Right Hope.' Yesterday we mentioned Rick Perry's interview in 'Parade Magazine,' the magazine most people mistake for coupons. Doesn't Rick Perry in this picture look like he is undressing himself with his eyes?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Herman Cain proposes policy the same way a teenage guy hits on a girl. 'We should make out. I'm just joking. Unless you think we should make out.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, this political season, like many Americans I've been swept up by a category 5 Herman Cain. He's the Washington outsider who's not afraid to say the things the nation needs to hear and then can't believe it just heard. Things like 'Let's electrocute Mexicans,' or 'I'm leading in the polls.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the latest CBS/New York Times/Taco Bell poll has Cain at 25% beating Mitt Romney at 21%. Why? Well, a lot of theories out there. Some say it's Cain's business experience, some say it's his simplified tax plan, some say it's just that he's not Mitt Romney. Others point to the fact that Mitt Romney is Mitt Romney.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, I've got to tell you something; we're still on kind of a high. We had President Obama on last night. That was quite an honor having him on the show. Yeah, I think the President enjoys visiting NBC because we're the only place that has lower numbers than he does.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here is a huge political development. According to today's, CBS/'New York Times' poll Rick Perry has now fallen to fifth place. Fifth place. You know who is in fourth place? Carrot Top. Carrot Top is in fourth. Even more surprising, Newt Gingrich has moved up to third. He's in third place. Well, Newt is so excited; he put his next divorce on hold. He's waiting now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Michele Bachmann told reporters that she would lead the nation in prayer if she is elected President. You know, if she's elected President, we're all going to be praying. Okay, you don't have to lead us. We'll be way ahead of you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to a Gallop poll, 50% of Americans now say marijuana should be made legal. The other 50% already think it is legal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Texas governor, Rick 'Turn on the Juice' Perry. Here's a guy who wants to be President of the United States. And a couple of years ago, he thought Texas should secede from the United States. But now he wants to be President of the United States. Interesting ideological combination, but he's now saying he's behind in the polls and he's not taking it well. He's really not taking it well. He's dropped in the polls. Today he executed his pollster.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, celebrity birthday, Hillary Clinton, Secretary of State, 64-years-old today. Happy birthday. Today, Donald Trump demanded to see her birth certificate. But if you want to get Hillary Clinton a gift and by God, why not? I mean, here's a woman who really has been working 24/7, flying around the world, mediating and meeting and trying to put together deals and brokering peace, and if you want to get the Secretary of State a nice gift, why not?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. And now, a few words from Moammar's closest friend, Loni Anderson.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rick Perry is now talking a lot. In a new interview he said it was a mistake for him to participate in the presidential debates. Yeah. Perry said. 'I'm not one of those word talkers.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Michele Bachmann said she wants her three daughters to learn to shoot a gun. Yeah, mostly so they can put her campaign out of its misery.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know, the number one movie in the country is 'Paranormal Activity 3.' It made $54 million this past weekend. Really scary. Have you seen it? It's a scary movie about an invisible demon named Toby, who lives in this house. You know how they finally get rid of him? I don't want to give it away. They give him an adjustable rate mortgage. You see, and when he misses a payment ? boom! The bank forecloses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Rick Perry now accusing Mitt Romney of, and I quote, 'Finger in the wind,' politics. Now don't confuse that with what's going on in Congress. That's thumb up your [bleep] politics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And they're starting to thin the herd a little bit. Michele Bachmann's entire New Hampshire campaign team has quit. They said her campaign was rude, unprofessional, dishonest and at times cruel. That's what they said. In fact, one person even used the term 'bitchy.' But, they were talking about her husband Marcus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, what do you think of this? A team of British lawyers has now concluded that the Declaration of Independence was illegal, and the American colonies had no right to secede from England. Well, you thought our court system was backed up. Oh, my God!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Michele Bachmann, she started out like a house of fire, everybody said 'Oh, let's go. This is going to be great. She could be the President.' And now her advisors have left. You can believe that? I mean you're saying she had advisors? One of her advisors wanted to stay but Curly and Larry talked him out of it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They buried Gadhafi in an unmarked grave, were you aware of this? Well, of course, it what had to be unmarked. Nobody knows how to spell his name, that's why.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama just announced that a new student loan plan that will forgive debt after 20 years. Obama said that forgiving debt is the most honorable thing someone can do, and then he repeated that in Chinese.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A company in Illinois is selling a collectible baby doll of President Obama. It's really cute. The doll can even say a few words as long as it has a teleprompter. And just so Republicans don't complain, it even comes with a birth certificate. Isn't that cute?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We begin tonight in the field of presidential politics have. If you been following the GOP presidential race you know Mittens Romney has been the uncontested front-runner for everyone's second choice for the Republican nomination. He's the subject of tonight's installment of 'Indecision 2012, Scared Mittless.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But as front-runners have come and gone Romney remains. Let's check in where he's at right now. ... Mr. 23%. Still a better nick name than Mitt. So when it comes to his polling numbers Mitt Romney has been nothing if not consistent which is interesting, given that in every other regard, he has been shockingly inconsistent. How has he managed to neither gain nor lose support. To remain inert, if he were a color he would be beige. If he were an ice cream flavor, he'd be beige.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, it is a dark day in America. Our way of life is under attack from the 'youthstapo' over at 'shock-upy' Wall Street, trademarked. We knew they were completely aimless and unfocused. Now we know they are violent. On Tuesday in Oakland, California, protestors threw rocks and bottles at police forcing the cops to respond with their own improvised weapons. Tear gas canisters, flash grenades and bean bag guns. Bean bag guns? Really, bean bags? That's nothing more than a high velocity hacky sack you are playing right into the protestors' hands. And feet.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama invited trick-or-treaters to the White House Saturday night. And very scary party they had. They sat in a circle, turned off all the lights and the kids read the President his poll numbers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Think people scaled back a little this year on the costumes? Yeah? Like, I saw a woman, wandering around aimlessly, nobody was with her, and she seemed confused, I said, 'Who you supposed to be?' She said, 'Michele Bachmann.' I said, 'Oh, of course.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier tonight, a bunch of rich kids came to my door, took all my candy and the other 99% of the kids in the neighborhood are now occupying my lawn.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to Politico, back in the '90s, when he [Herman Cain] was running that pizza company, two women claimed he harassed them and made them uncomfortable. Apparently he would ask them, 'Who's your Godfather?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Rick Perry unveiled his new tax plan. He feels the tax code should be simple, you know, like he is. Very simple.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, in international news, officials are in contact with Gadhafi's son about a possible surrender, but he says no. He says he will not give up. Isn't that amazing? After all the horrible things that have happened over there, Gadhafi's son will not give up. Boy, he'd make a great Colts fan, wouldn't he?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the economy is still hurting. Here's a fact. 30% of Americans are so disillusioned, they are thinking of moving back to Mexico.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody caught in the big snowstorm? The big blizzard? Now it's so cold. You know how cold it is in New York City? It's so cold Moammar Gadhafi is happy to be in Hell.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Would you folks vote for Herman Cain now? My God, I would. I would. I like his campaign manager. ... I like that guy. Can't get enough of that guy. Hey, we're going to take the country back. We're going to make the United States safe to smoke.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So now Herman Cain when he was the chairman of the National Restaurant Association back in the '90s is saying there was a claim of sexual harassment. I looked it up. You can't take this lightly. I looked it up. It was not a claim. Here's what happened. He was just listing the specials.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot has changed in this town since we left about two and a half years ago. That's right. Gay marriage is now legal in New York. I will be honest with you. If that would have been the case a few years ago, Andy and I would never have left. We wouldn't have married those icky girls either.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Herman Cain is having to respond to claims that he once sexually harassed women. Did you hear that? Apparently a German woman kept telling him 'Nein, nein, nein!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I heard that the US is planning to send a surveillance blimp to Afghanistan next year. That's gotta suck when you're under attack. It's like, 'Oh, we've been spotted. Let's get out of here. They saw us. We got to get out of here. We got to get out of here. This is dangerous. It's dangerous area. Oh, the winds blowing. The wind's blowing. The wind's blowing. Oh, crap! The wind's blowing!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[On Perry's latest speech] &quot;Best-case scenario: That dude's hammered.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last week Representative Eric Cantor announced that in 2012 the House of Representatives will be in session a scant 109 days. But how will they accomplish nothing in such a short time?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;The Obamas celebrated Halloween at the White House over the weekend. Trick or treaters came to the White House for about an hour on Saturday. Once again, Obama handing out welfare for candy. Conservatives are already accusing the President of seriously depleting our country's tootsie roll reserve. The Obamas gave snack bags and inside, M&amp;Ms with the Presidential Seal on them, cookies shaped like a White House and some dried fruit, which, I guess,&quot; means &quot;you don't have to be worried about getting egged when you live in the White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;In New York, the Occupy Wall Street protesters are now frozen. Tents don't give you much protection from the snow and to make matters worse, city officials confiscated the generators that were powering their portable heaters out there. They are thinking of changing the name from Occupy Wall Street to I'm Freezing my Beard Off. Protesters were forced to huddle around their bongs for warmth today.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, President Obama had his annual physical. Doctors say he is in excellent health, except his blood pressure. It's 70 over 14 trillion. Yeah, that's not good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's being reported that two female employees complained of sexually suggestive behavior by Herman Cain back in the 1990's. See, all this time he's been running as Republican and it turns out he's really a Democrat.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You folks following the Republican run for the White House? Reminds me of the old days when I was a kid the circus would come to town. God bless Herman Cain.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, here's good news from the White House. President Obama had his annual physical, his annual checkup, everything looks good.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, good news for the President. Check it out, president Obama just had a physical exam.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, everybody knows it is day 46 of Occupy Wall Street and it is a disorganized mess. I mean think of it. At this point, the Tea Party already had their own news network.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;[On Cain's foreign policy statements.] Yes. China has indicated it would like to develop nuclear capability. Perhaps as soon as the 1960s. Worse yet, I understand that the Chinese at this very moment are on the verge of developing a cookie that can predict the future. How do you defeat an enemy whose pastries know what you're going to do next! That's the scandal!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bank of America will drop its $5 debit card fee. Of course that comes with a $6 fee removal fee.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These decades-old allegations against Cain are just an attempt to distract us from what a great President he would be. Cain understands domestic issues because he had experience selling pizza. And he understands international issues because pizza is Italian.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, the Occupy Wall Street Movement has been going on nearly two months now, and I'm still not sure what they want. Based on all the drumming, I'm guessing they're waiting for the sax to come in. But one of the things that has gotten their white boy dreads in a bunch is the so-called income gap. And it's only getting so-called worse. In fact, America now has an income gap similar to the Philippines and Mexico. Sounds bad, but it could mean we're about to see a boom in our cockfighting industry. The free market has confirmed that the gap exists because Proctor &amp; Gamble has found the consumer market eroding in the middle, and as a result, have begun aiming advertising directly at the high-and low-end markets with products like new bargain dish soap. You know the economy sucks when Dawn is now a status symbol. A lot of people can only afford dusk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Congress was hard at work yesterday. They voted 396-9 to reaffirm 'In God We Trust' as our national motto. I still don't know why we would trust God after what he did to Kim Kardashian and Kris, but apparently we do. The vote wasn't unanimous. Some people don't believe religion has a place on US currency and in fact there was a motion to replace it, which we have on the dollar bill, with this phrase. 'Snooki Lives Here.' But that was voted down. It does have a nice ring to it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's starting to get nasty in the Republican campaign. Herman Cain's top aide has accused Rick Perry's campaign of being behind all those stories about the sexual harassment stuff. I don't know. Do you think that's true? Does Rick Perry look like he's smart enough to pull something like that off?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More problems with frontrunner Herman Cain. Now a third woman has come forward and accused him of sexual harassment. See, apparently when Cain was president of the Restaurant Association, he thought women were on the menu. Turns out 9-9-9 was just his rating system. 'Ooh, she's a nine.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big rumor going around right now is that Herman Cain's wife is considering giving a TV interview. And today, out of force of habit, Herman Cain said, 'I never touched her either! I know nothing about that.' And of course, Cain still doesn't get it. Like he said, he will address all these charges at a press conference tomorrow at Hooters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's something kind of scary. Four anti-government senior citizens in Georgia have been charged in a terror plot. All of the men are in their '60s and '70s. And they planned to build a bomb and blow up a government building. Can you imagine? Remember the underwear bomber? These guys are the Depends bombers. They're worse. And their bomb is not as sophisticated as the other terrorists. Like, instead of being detonated by the cell phone, this one is triggered by the Clapper.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy news from the home front. Eight years ago my son Harry was born. Happy birthday to Harry! I got a call earlier today from Donald Trump demanding to see his birth certificate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, good news for all of us, President Obama had his annual White House physical and the doctors say that President Obama is in such great shape, he's in top physical condition of his life. They say he's in such good health that he can actually start smoking again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama just went to the G-20 summit to give Europe advice on its debt crisis. Wait, Europe is getting economic advice from Obama?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama bumped Chinese President Hu Jintao from the number one spot on 'Forbes' list of the world's most powerful people. Yeah, it was awkward, though. Obama wanted to buy a copy of the magazine, but he had to borrow five bucks from Hu Jintao.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is interesting. China just launched a program to prevent divorce by having newlyweds write love letters to each other which get delivered seven years after their wedding day. Yeah. Cute. And just to make sure that it takes seven years to get there, they're using the US Postal Service.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now the Occupy Wall Street Movement, a visceral expression of frustration with our system's institutionalized economic inequality and it resonates with many, many people. With just one small caveat. If this turns into throwing trash buckets into Starbucks windows, nobody's going to be down with that. We all love Starbucks. How do you not love Starbucks, coffee, adult contemporary music, free Wi-Fi, it is what many of us believe heaven to be. So what is happening? ... No, no! No damage! No damage, bad Occupiers! The Starbucks was just a metaphor for general vandalism, I want to be clear. All retail establishments, no. Even mom and pop stores, no. No Men's Wearhouse vandalism, no bowling ball into a Trader Joe's. Do we have to get this specific? ... No throwing a roll of pennies through the window of a 99 cent store, although it would be very clever. That would be clever. But don't do it!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Seriously? The Congress debating the motto of the United States. A sacred part of our national heritage ever since our Founding Founders created our motto back in-- 1956. All right. Hey, is that what we're doing here? Are we taking suggestions for new mottos? I got a couple. How about this: 'America, you've met our drones, now meet our people.' Or, 'America, home of the Reagan.' ... Actually, the vote wasn't to change the slogan but reaffirm the slogan, essentially renewing the wedding vows between God and America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now Europe, if I may, a little advice. When borrowing from the Chinese it is polite to send them a thank you gift. Perhaps all of your manufacturing jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;There was some trouble last night in Oakland after the Occupy Oakland protests. Demonstrators broke windows, set fires and threw chunks of concrete. A spokesman called it the worst rioting in the city since ever single Raiders home game. Things got so bad the riot police had to come in and shut the port of Oakland. They had trouble breaking the crowd up because every time they fired bean backs at them, they started playing hockey sack with them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Republican presidential candidate and former Godfather's Pizza CEO Herman Cain is having a rough month. Yesterday, a third woman came forward to claim she was a victim of harassment. They say it comes in threes, so that was expected. Things got more interesting. Yesterday, Cain blamed Rick Perry's campaign for leaking the story to the press. ... Cain's chief of staff called the Perry campaign 'despicable' for leaking the information. Which, I love that strategy. That's like when your wife catches you cheating by going through your phone and you go, 'You went through my phone?' Strong move.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a great day for President Obama. 'Forbes' magazine put out a list of the most powerful people in the world. And our President is number one. I guess nobody told Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama boom finished up in France today at the G-20 summit. He joined other world leaders in trying to convince Greece to cut back in spending and reduce their debt. This is part of their 'Do As We Say Not As We Do Summit', apparently. You know, if they're serious about cutting back on spending, how about not holding these summits in the world's most expensive places like the south of France, okay. What's wrong with the function room at Denny's or the Waffle House?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the economic situation in Greece is not getting any better. In fact, political experts say that if Greece goes under, the world banks will go under, and then the US economy will go under, and this will cost President Obama the election. But Obama still has three chances to win. Rick Perry, Mitt Romney, and Herman Cain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're getting a lot more information about these women that Cain allegedly sexually harassed. One of the women was paid $35,000. Another was paid $45,000. And did you hear Herman Cain's campaign&quot; take on the issue? He &quot;said this proves he can create high-paying jobs for women.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know anything about Herman Cain the Republican front-runner? I've seen all these Republican debates and Herman Cain is the only one who has any dynamism, the only one with any charisma. ... Here is a ball of fire and a bundle of energy and the front-runner for the Republicans. You know the tax idea 9-9-9? He had trouble with charges of sexual harassment. It turns out he was able to come up with the 9-9-9 tax plan after three German women turned him down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All the trouble began when Herman was the President of the National Restaurant Association, the NRA. I don't know. I thought it was a different deal. So three women from that time period when he was president of the NRA, have come forward and said he was acting in a peculiar way. Doing this sexual harassment. You know what it is, it's like carry-on luggage, you really should only be allowed two.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Herman was unaware that China is a nuclear power. He didn't know that China is a nuclear power. Been that way since 1964, had no idea China was a nuclear power.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's some election news, you guys. This week, Mitt Romney's campaign sent out automated phone calls saying that Rick Perry is too soft on immigration. Yeah.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't know what to make of this. A man called the police this week after a snake crawled out of the ATM he was using. Yeah.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is big news today on healthcare reform. Dr. Murray is going to jail! Conrad Murray found guilty of giving Michael Jackson an overdose of a prescription sleeping aid. Pretty reckless on the part of the doctor. They said the sedative he prescribed was five times more powerful than a Joe Biden speech.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Herman Cain is also taking some flak for saying that China was developing nuclear weapons, but they've had them since the '60s. See, I don't think he's that well-versed on foreign affairs. Like, today, a reporter asked him how he would handle Greece, and he said he would put an extra layer of wax paper under the pizza before you put it in the box .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, folks, the people have spoken, and the people have won. All of this Occupy stuff that's going on. Bank of America has withdrawn their $5 monthly debit fee. That's right! The people! The people have won! The people beat Bank of America with their $5 debit fee. Instead, the Bank of America is going to replace that with a $60 annual fee.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you like scientific news from outer space? Get ready, buddy because here it comes. Giant, giant asteroid speeding toward earth. That's what NASA said. Speeding toward earth. But NASA is saying nothing to worry about. I'm thinking 'Are you kidding me. These guys aren't exactly rocket scientists you know.' Or are they, I don't know. The giant asteroid is supposed to slam into earth by Tuesday, unless there's construction on the FDR and then they don't know. They just don't know.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top Ten Signs Herman Cain is Losing It:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Now smokes more than his campaign manager</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Was recently found hiding in a drainpipe with a golden gun</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Keeps asking voters if they want to touch his moustache</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Claims Justin Bieber is his father</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Campaigning as his hilarious alter ego, Pee-Wee Herman Cain</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Just paid a visit to Dr. Conrad Murray</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Spent last of campaign funds betting on the Colts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Gave rambling, drunken speech ? oh, I'm sorry, that was Rick Perry</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. He's engaged to Kim Kardashian.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Herman Cain's fourth female accuser held a news conference today where she claimed Herman Cain offered her a job in exchange for sexual favors. Now say what you want about the guy. At least he has a plan to put people back to work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend Herman Cain told reporters, this is a quote, 'When people get on the Cain train, they don't get off.' After hearing this, everyone in America sued Herman Cain for sexual harassment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new report shows that police in New York makes 50,000 arrests every year for marijuana possession. Which explains that new show 'Law &amp; Order: Special Funions Unit.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was not a great day for Herman Cain, the front runner for the Republican presidential nomination ... Unfortunately, Cain is also the frontrunner in sexual harassment claims. I believe very firmly that he's innocent until proven guilty. But today another woman accused him of harassment. How many women does that make? Do we have the tally thing? Four, four. Ok. Now the first time you hear a nasty accusation like this you think, it may or may not be true. When it happens twice, you think you go 'Hmmm?' The third time you go, 'Ok, it's probably true.' But the fourth time you go, 'Who does that man think he is, Schwarzenegger?' Four women have accused Herman Cain of being inappropriate. That's got to remind him of the deal he offered back when he ran pizza joints. Harass four you get the fifth free.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new statistic shows that strength training injuries among women have jumped 53%. It said a great number of women are hitting the weight rooms now, and building up their muscles. So ? more bad news for Herman Cain. Yeah, that's not good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A fourth woman has come forward, and accused Herman Cain of sexual harassment. This woman gave the details. Pretty graphic. Said Herman Cain tried to put his hand up her skirt, so now when Cain says he's reaching out to the American people, you know what he's reaching for.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cain said earlier tonight he would be willing to take a lie detector test. But see, a lie detector, that's kind of a double-edged sword. 'Cause if he fails, his career is over. And if he passes and it turns out he's not a liar, he's obviously not cut out for politics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Cain released his new campaign slogan: 'Hope and Change the Subject.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new poll taken abroad found that President Obama's policies are more popular overseas than they are here in America. Well, yeah. That's 'cause it's created more jobs overseas than here in America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House says there is no evidence at all that earth has been visited by aliens. Do you believe that? See, we can't even find aliens sneaking across the border, okay? How are we going to find aliens? Anyway, the White House went on to say if there were life on other planets, we would have borrowed money from them by now. But I was thinking about that. I mean, if the earth was visited by aliens, this could be a huge problem for the Republican Party. I mean, Michele Bachmann would want to deport them, Rick Perry would want to execute them, Mitt Romney would be undecided about what to do, and Herman Cain would try to take them up to his room.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a new study shows that Washington, DC -- this surprised me, I thought it would have been Beverly Hills or maybe New York, but Washington, DC is the most shopaholic city in the US. Did you know that? It has the most shopaholics in the country. Well, of course, they're shopping with other people's money. That's why.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new study says that older Americans are now 47 times richer than younger Americans. So, if you're older and broke, at least you know what it's like to feel young again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Are you excited? I'm so excited. You know about the giant asteroid? Well, I'm glad you heard it from me first. Giant asteroid rocketing toward the earth. And this only happens like once in a century. Giant asteroid right on to earth. Only once in a century. It's so rare it's like a guilty verdict from a LA jury. It's that rare.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, while you were applauding three more women have accused Herman Cain of improper behavior. It's just now getting silly. There are four women that have accused Republican candidate Herman Cain for President of vigorous and inappropriate groping. Vigorous and inappropriate groping. Nothing worse than a lethargic groping. If this guy isn't elected President he could always work at airport security.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That Herman Cain. The problem is he starts out, we don't know anything about him, we get excited about him because the energy, this guy has tremendous energy and charisma and we find out there's skeletons in his closet. That happens all the time in politics. I'll tell you another, like Rick Perry, Governor of Texas. He's got skeletons in his closets, honestly. These are actual skeletons. People he's executed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top Ten Things A Candidate Doesn't Want to Hear On Election Day:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. What? The election's today?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. You need to sober up for your concession speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. You're running for office? That's hilarious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. There he is ? get him!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Your wife and your mistress are both here to see you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. You're losing the red states and the blue states but you're doing okay in the lesser-known yellow states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. If pets are allowed to vote, I think we have a shot at this thing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The only endorsements we've got: Silvio Berlusconi and Conrad Murray.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Asteroid! Run for your lives!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Gloria Allred, line one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is Tuesday. That means another woman has come forward to accuse Herman Cain of sexual harassment. It's one a day now. Every day, a new woman comes forward. Mitt Romney is weighing in. He called the sexual harassment charges against Republican frontrunner Herman Cain 'disturbing.' He said, 'And by disturbing, I mean awesome.' Then he high-fived Herman Cain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's a weird fact, according to a new poll that just came out, 42% percent of Americans say they are uncomfortable with the idea of having a Mormon President; 42%. When asked why, the people said. 'Because we're still getting used to having a Muslim President.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is important, you guys. Tomorrow FEMA will run a 30-second test of the Emergency Alert System. Yup, it's designed to inform people who may not be aware of an emergency, you know, like FEMA.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Get this, several counties in Oregon are letting people vote on iPads, to make it easier for the elderly. Which explains their new state motto 'Oregon, We Know Nothing About Old People.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Occupy Wall Street protests have reminded Americans of two thing: One, the unchecked excesses of the financial industry and, two, just how few public toilet facilities there are in Lower Manhattan. 'Can a brother get a bathroom up in this [bleep?] No bathroom? Come on!' But addressing income inequality and unraveling the complex and often times corrupt relationship between government and corporations is going to be more difficult than sustained rhythmic drumming would suggest. Wall Street executives become government officials tasked with regulating Wall Street companies that they will soon be hired to lobby for. It's a confusing. If only one man could embody the corporate industrial government complex in all its cluster[bleep]itude. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you former New Jersey Governor, New Jersey Senator, and Goldman Sachs CEO Jon Corzine!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;[On Herman Cain's appearance on 'Jimmy Kimmel'] As Fox News's website declared, 'Cain hit homerun on Kimmel' Which is impressive because he was only trying to get to third base.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, everybody knows there is a war on the wealthy in this country. The only good news is the rich people have all the polo mallets. And things are starting to get rough, folks, massive demonstrations, uprisings by the downtrodden have happened all over the country with unreasonable demands for economic equality and threats of cannibalism. They know we're delicious! Who told? The secret is out. I'm particularly well-marbled. I spend all day penned in at my desk eating corn, drinking beer and being massaged by Japanese women. I'm human Kobe beef.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;We should be thankful to be alive right now. Are we alive? I guess we don't really know, do we? A few hours ago, an asteroid bigger than an aircraft carrier passed inside the orbit of the moon. A 1,300 foot wide rock just missed the earth and not a single one of us even looked up from our cell phones to see it. We only care about flying objects when they're Angry Birds. The asteroid missed the earth, fortunately, but the President had Bruce Willis, Michael Bay and Aerosmith standing by just in case. It came within 200,000 miles of us, which is close enough for anyone with a medium-sized telescope to get a look at it but not close enough to be groped by Herman Cain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Herman Cain was with us on the show last night and I don't know what to believe. He was very blunt about saying that Herman Cain never harassed anyone and Herman Cain even offered to submit Herman Cain to a lie detector test to prove that Herman Cain didn't say any of these things. I haven't heard someone refer to themselves in the third person that much since, I think, David Hasselhoff was here on the show.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;There's a fifth woman that claims to have had a problem with Cain. That's a lot. That's five, if this keeps up, it seems very unlikely he will be President, although it seems more and more likely he will become Governor of California.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Meanwhile, our President, President Obama, might be a little worried today. A new poll says that voters in 12 swing states would rather have a, quote, 'generic Republican candidate' in the White House than him. You think Mitt Romney would be generic enough, but apparently he isn't.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Herman Cain held a press conference to deny charges that he had sexually harassed any women. Well, of course, they deny them. Who has a press conference ? 'Yeah, I love grabbing [bleep]. I want to grab some more. I'm making that announcement right now.' Of course you deny it. Like people are surprised.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know what's weird about his press conference? I don't know if you saw it. Instead of saying 'me' or 'I,' Herman Cain kept referring to himself in the third person. See, that's not good. When even Herman Cain is trying to distance himself from Herman Cain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cain said he is willing to take a lie detector test. Well, sure, he's smart. He knows lie detector tests weren't made to handle politicians. They're for thieves and murderers. You know you put a politician on one of those, they're going to short circuit and blow out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the latest NBC poll shows Jon Huntsman, who is also running for President, at 0%. He peaked at 3%. He's now at 0%. Do you know what that means? Zero? That means he's not even voting for himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Wells Fargo announced this week they are launching a new bank that will cater exclusively to customers worth over $50 million. It's called 'The Screw the Other 99% Bank.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that Herman Cain? He's blaming all his scandals now-- and women are one after another, and Herman says, 'No, none of this is true, and it's all being fermented by the Democratic machine.' He said the Democratic machine is causing all his problems, paying women to come out and make these false accusations. The Democratic machine. And I said to myself, 'Oh, yeah, the well-oiled Democratic machine that lost 80 Congressional seats. That well-oiled Democratic machine. Of course that's what's going on.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Herman Cain says he will not quit. He is going to stay in the race. You know what that means? He'll be gone in a week. But he emphatically denies all of the accusations, and he has even offered to take a lie detector test. I'm telling you something, buddy. You've drawn a line in the sand if you say, 'You know what? I'll take a lie detector test.' That means something right there. Dick Cheney had to get his nose in it. You remember Dick 'Kaboom' Cheney? ... He said, 'Forget the lie detector test. By God, let's waterboard him!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier tonight on television, another Republican debate. Boy, oh, boy. Yeah, buddy. I mean, I'm telling you, those things will put you to sleep faster than Dr. Conrad Murray.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Herman Cain gave his first press conference since being accused of sexual harassment. Yep. First Cain took a bunch of questions; then he took bunch of phone numbers. It was weird.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an interview with ABC News, Michele Bachmann said that she would like to add James Garfield to Mt. Rushmore. She was like, 'And if you put Garfield up there, you can't leave out Odie. You have to put Odie as well.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The important thing is this: Herman Cain was on TV. I love that guy. ... Wow, now Herman Cain is acting like he never met Herman Cain. Who talks in the third person? Maybe Herman Cain is The Hulk. 'Herman Cain sad.' Either way, Jon Stewart is impressed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tuesday's press conference shows that since we heard about Cain's old employer the National Restaurant Association settling two claims of sexual harassment against him more than a week ago, we swiftly moved to stage four of a political sex scandal. Stage one was last Monday. 'I have no idea what you are talking about.' Stage two was that same night. 'Oh, right, that thing.' And stage three was the rest of the week. 'I'm not going to talk about this anymore.' Which brings us back to stage four, the press conference to assuage the damage caused by how badly he handled steps one through three.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[On Cain's allegations that the 'Democrat machine is behind harassment allegations] &quot;The Democrat machine. I believe I've seen one of those. I don't know if you know anything about it, from what I understand it costs billions of dollars. It runs on solar energy and it turns hope into disappointment. ... Mr. Cain, nothing personal but I don't think the Democrats are trying to sabotage your campaign because A: We all know Democrats don't think sexual misconduct disqualifies you from holding the Presidency ... And B: They've seen you debate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;There's another Republican presidential debate tonight. This one focused on why there were so many Republican presidential debates. It's the first of two debates this week. Tonight was the performance debate and Saturday night is the results show.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;CNBC hosted the event from Oakland University in Rochester, Michigan. They called it 'Your Money, Your Vote.' it centered on the economy. The candidates argued about who created the most jobs. Mitt Romney said he created thousands of jobs as Governor of Massachusetts. Rick Perry said he created thousands as Governor of Texas. Herman Cain said he tried to create a number of jobs for women but now he's getting attacked for it all of a sudden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;They asked Mitt Romney all the character questions, like if he would hire Herman Cain at CEO of his company and he refused to answer. See, if I were Mitt Romney, I wouldn't show up anymore. I would just go to Hawaii and wait it out until the election, drink some caffeine free Diet Coke and watch Herman Cain and Rick Perry self-destruct.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a great day for the Republicans. I was watching the debate earlier tonight because we're live. It got pretty rowdy. All the candidates were really piling on Herman Cain. He loved it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, a new poll shows 45% of Republicans believe that Mitt Romney will be the nominee, and that rises to 46% if you count Rick Perry, who also believes Mitt Romney will be the nominee.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, more bad news for Rick Perry. Oh, gosh, yeah. Tomorrow there's another debate. You know, if he was smart, he would just forget to show up. I forgot!

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Obama's body man ? that's who they call the President's assistant ? a body man.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, here you go.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some election news yesterday, Herman Cain said that he would defeat Obama by 'Beating him with a cane.' Get it? Herman Cain? Yeah. In response, Obama said, 'I'm just glad I'm not running against Anthony Weiner.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, a group of Wall Street protesters interrupted Michele Bachmann's speech in South Carolina. In response, Bachmann supporters were like, 'Man, if we existed, we'd be so angry right now.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Italian prime minister announced he is stepping down. He's looking forward to spending more time with his wife and five hookers.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, there was another Republican debate on Saturday. I believe this was 118th, I think, something like that. Rick Perry, of course was trying to make light of his whole situation. Have you heard Rick Perry? Is he starting to sound more and more like Mike 'The Situation?' And Rick Perry says he wants to get rid of the Department of Education. Well, sure, what the hell has it ever done for him? And Rick Perry's poll numbers continue to drop which is bad news for him. Because believe me, this country would never elect a slow-witted Governor from Texas -- twice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the debate Saturday night, Michele Bachmann announced she is for waterboarding, but just for gay terrorists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And an 18-year-old high school senior in Airedale, Iowa has been elected mayor. He got 24 votes and he won -- 24 votes. And today Jon Huntsman said 'What's your secret? Who is your campaign guy?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And all of these Republican candidates are claiming that God told them to run. Rick Perry, Michele Bachmann, Herman Cain, God all told them to run. I think God needs new people on the Fave Five Calling Plan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah. And Herman Cain's wife said that he respects women. Only in politics does your wife come forward and defend you. ... Anyway, anyway, she said that he puts women on a pedestal. That's what his wife said. See, it's easier to reach under the skirt that way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new CNN poll shows that Newt Gingrich has soared to a statistical dead heat with Mitt Romney. The reason it's a dead heat is Mitt Romney is about as exciting as a dead guy and Newt is always in heat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Wal-Mart announced it's moving the start of Black Friday to Thanksgiving night. They're going to open their store on Thanksgiving at 10:00. Really? This gives people the chance to get the jump on buying goods made in China that they can't really afford anymore because they lost their jobs to companies making cheap goods in China.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to a recent 'Cosmo' poll, 50% of men admit they don't reveal the number of women they've slept with. The other 50% just run for President and wait for the women to reveal it themselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody still talking about Rick Perry's memory lapse. And he had three points he wanted to make and he couldn't. ... Remember a couple of months ago he had trouble remembering the name of his hunting camp. Do you remember that episode?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I mean honest to God, I'm ready if we have to sit through any more of these Republican debates, I'm ready for a dictatorship. Oh my God. Last week they debated about the economy. This week it's foreign policy. Next week, next week, movie trivia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that Herman Cain, you know? I mean fascinating guy. ... I'm thinking Herman Cain doesn't get it. He brought a date to the debate. Did you know that? And he also says that he's in favor of waterboarding as long as it is consensual.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Newt Gingrich is doing very well, and Mitt Romney, both apparently tied and that's a tough decision. It's funny, Romney is the Mormon and Newt Gingrich is the one with three wives. It's odd.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ron Paul's campaign is upset because during last week's Republican presidential debate, he only got to speak for 89 seconds. Yeah, meanwhile, Rick Perry's campaign is upset because during last week's debate, he got to speak.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, you guys know there was another Republican debate on Saturday, and listen to this. Ron Paul only got 89 seconds to speak. Seriously? Rick Perry gets more time than that to try to remember something.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, presidential candidate Jon Huntsman accused his Republican opponents of coming up with easy sound bites just to get applause. In response, Mitt Romney was like, 'That is ridiculous. Clap if you like bacon.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're going to begin with the Republican campaign for the White House and the pressing question, 'How do you know if you've had too many debates?' Here's a clue. Saturday night's 3,000th Republican debate was an hour-and-a-half. But CBS only aired one hour of it so they could still bring you, the viewer, a fresh 'NCIS' rerun. CBS wanted people to learn something about how the government can work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Herman Cain's wife spoke to the press today about charges against her husband. She said if it's true, then her husband 'Must have a split personality.' Herman Cain responded by saying 'She's right.' Then said 'No she isn't.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, President Obama was in Hawaii, his 'birthplace.' He attended the big APEC Summit meeting. APEC is the Asia-Pacific Economic Conference. Once a year its leaders get together to discuss free trade, economic growth and blah-blah-blah. I'm bored already. Here's a recap of the conference. President Obama said 'Nuh-uh, China.' China was like 'Wha--?' And Obama went 'No.' Take that, 'Nightline!' But I'm sure the conference was a barrel of laughs. Everybody loves being in Hawaii. The Republican candidate Rick Perry said Hawaii is one of his favorite states. His favorite states are Texas, Hawaii and there was another one ?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's nice they held the APEC conference in Hawaii. But I wonder if things got awkward with the leaders from Japan. 'And over here is Pearl Harbor. I think you've seen that before.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, President Obama recently attended a college basketball game in San Diego that was aboard the USS Carl Vinson, the big aircraft carrier. Yeah, he said it was nice to finally be standing on a ship that wasn't sinking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And good old Herman Cain, he might be a good businessman, but he demonstrated yesterday how little he knows about foreign policy. Hear about this? When asked about Libya, he said, 'Hey, I've never touched a woman there.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an interview in Milwaukee, Herman Cain was asked about Libya. He got completely lost. He didn't say anything for a while. He stumbled and he said he was having trouble 'cause he has all of this stuff twirling around in his head. And then he drew a complete blank. You know what this means? Rick Perry is contagious!&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know I don't want to say Cain is not educated when it comes to foreign policy, but today, he admitted everything he knows he learned from watching 'Where in the World is Matt Lauer?' I think he's getting a little desperate. Midway through the interview about Libya, he said, 'Hey, don't you have any questions about sexual harassment? Another chick has come forward. You know this is the fourth one. Can't we talk about that?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, although he's being accused of sexual harassment, Herman Cain's wife said it is not true. And she said her husband would have to have a split personality to do the things he's been accused of. Well, not necessarily. Look at Mitt Romney. Mitt Romney has never done any of those things, but he has a split personality. One day he's a conservative Republican. Next day, liberal Democrat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And former Speaker Nancy Pelosi denied a '60 Minutes' report that she profited on insider trading stock tips. In fact, Pelosi looked furious about the report. Or maybe that was surprised or shocked or delighted. You know it's hard to tell with her.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You folks been watching the Republicans debate? Pretty good, isn't it? They only got 50 or 60 more debates. And Rick Perry saying now he's going to uproot all three branches of the government. He's going to uproot all three branches and I said, 'Okay, Rick, governor, you got a deal. You uproot all three branches of government and I will be happy to uproot my family and move to Canada.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One by one the Republican candidate potentials have been shooting themselves in a foot making huge, horrible gaffes and they just look silly and it's gotten so bad President Obama is now worried he may actually be reelected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top Ten Thoughts That Went Through Herman Cain's Mind During This Moment (Answering Libya Question)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. Libya? I remember a Lydia, but I don't remember a Libya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. I told them politics was off limits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Maybe if I hold perfectly still everyone will think their DVRs are on pause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Why the hell am I in Milwaukee?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Uh? 9-9-9?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. What would Rick Dees do?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. I'm gonna be on YouTube!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. I should have called Bob Costas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. These things are a lot funnier when they happen to Rick Perry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Well it's been fun. See you in 2016!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big story, Occupy protestors were ordered to leave Zucotti Park. ... Police reported that anyone who enters with a large backpack, they would not be allowed to enter Zucotti Park. And in a related incident, Dora the Explorer was arrested.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During a fund-raiser yesterday, President Obama urged his supporters to watch the GOP debates. Although legally he had to add, 'But not while operating heavy machinery.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some election news. Today, Rick Perry unveiled a new plan to completely overhaul all three branches of government. He unveiled a new plan to completely overhaul all three branches of government, just as soon as he comes up with a plan to remember all three branches of government. [ As Rick Perry ] 'The judicial, the Nina, the Pinta, and the Santa Maria.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, just two and a half weeks ago we found out Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain had sexual harassment issues when the National Restaurant Association settled some lawsuits for him setting off a media firestorm which lasted until six days ago when Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry fired the brain fart heard round the world. Also setting off a media firestorm. But, again, that's six days ago! Daddy need another hit of gas because once again the race to determine the most qualified opponent to challenge the current leader of the free world in the November 2012 general election is boring me!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;According to new Public Policy poll, there's yet another front-runner in the GOP field. Today, it's former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich who has pulled ahead of Herman Cain. In other words, the guy who eats a lot of pizza is on top of the candidate who made a lot of it. Mitt Romney is in third place with 18%. That's not a poll result. That's a cry for help. Every two weeks there's a new name on top. I think it's because people are sick of being asked. 'Who do I want to be President? I don't know. The fat one. Stop calling me at dinner while I'm trying to watch 'Wheel of Fortune.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Cain suffered an embarrassing moment yesterday during an interview. The reporter asked him if he agreed with the way Obama handled Libya and he paused for a very long time. Even Rick Perry was like, 'Come on, Herman, spit it out.' When he finally regained consciousness, he said he didn't agree but stopped himself and said, 'Oh, no, that's a different one.' Different what? A different Libya? 'I thought you meant Libya Newton-John.' It was yet another deer in the headlights moment for the Republican candidates. They're lucky Sarah Palin isn't running, they'd be venison by now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Some big news for the Occupy Wall Street protesters today. It might be over. They have to move because early this morning, riot police ordered everyone out of the park so it could be cleaned. Which, I think it's the first time they've ever cleaned anything in New York. Once they finished cleaning, the judge ruled the protesters could come back but they can't bring tents, which means it that will not be able to sleep over without freezing. Experts are calling this the largest group of displaced white people in Birkenstocks since Dave Matthews cancelled a show at the Ben and Jerry's factory in 1999.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, folks, the big political story this week was Herman Cain trying to answer questions about Libya. Did you see that interview? Yeah. It was hard to watch. He struggled and he stammered and kind of embarrassed himself. Some say it proves he's not qualified to be President. But the good news, rambling and embarrassing himself does qualify him to be Vice President.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know, you can tell Cain still doesn't get it. Like, today, he says, 'It's important to know about Libya because we need the libertarian vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, but to be fair, that's not his area. He's a businessman. 'Cause Cain's only real foreign policy experience, I guess, is when as president of the National Restaurant Association, he had to deal with the manager from the International House of Pancakes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in what may be a first in politics. This is unbelievable to me. People attending a Rick Perry event in New Hampshire had to prove they were US citizens. A pretty simple test. They ask you a math or science question. If you got it wrong, yeah, you went to school here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And on the Democratic side, Nancy Pelosi denouncing a '60 Minutes' story accusing her and other members of Congress of insider trading, which they all got huge returns and made a ton of money. Well, you ever notice members of Congress only invest their own money when it's a sure thing? Well, when it's something like that solar company, Solyndra, 'I'm not paying. Use the taxpayer money.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new study found about 47% of Congress are millionaires. The median net worth of Congress is $890,000. Median means half are worth more and half are worth less. How many think they're all worthless?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you been downtown to Zuccotti Park to see the protesters? ... Yeah, they went in there, a midnight raid, and the mayor rode in on his pet chihuahua. ... Here's how it works. No sleeping or camping in New York City parks. You understand what I'm saying? No sleeping, no camping in New York City parks. Hooker, crack dealers, not a problem! Not a problem!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier this week, they kind of hushed it up, and now it's coming to light, the White House, they found a bullet hole in the White House.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You keeping track of the Republican debates? They're doing, like, a thousand debates, and they try to keep them interesting. And in a couple of weeks they'll be debating in the nude. I'll be there. And they have different topics for the debates. Last week it was the economy. Coming up it will be foreign policy. Next week, it's Motown hits of the 60s.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about Newt Gingrich?. ... Now he's making a tremendous comeback. This could be the political story of the year. Newt Gingrich, the political story of the year. The year is 1996, but still, the political story.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Occupy Wall Street is in the news. Tomorrow, Occupy Wall Street protesters are planning to occupy the subway in New York City. Because if there is one place that you can confront the nation's wealthiest 1%, it's on the subway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Crazy story, the other day, you probably heard about this, someone shot a bullet at the White House. Yeah. The Secret Service immediately ruled out Jon Huntsman because that guy has no shot at the White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Glenn Beck is in the news. An interesting story. Former Fox News host Glenn Beck is developing an animated television series with a writer from 'The Simpsons.' The show is called 'Apu Gets Deported.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Republican presidential candidates have really been fighting for attention this week. In fact, Rick Perry actually proposed cutting the President's salary in half. Yeah. Perry was like, 'What do I care? It's not like it'll affect me.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of Rick Perry, in a new interview, Herman Cain said that if Rick Perry were an ice cream flavor, he'd be rocky road. I don't know, Perry's not really any flavor of ice cream. He's just the brain freeze part.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Herman Cain said that states should have the right to legalize medical marijuana. Or as some stoners put it, 'Wait, he sells pizza and he likes weed? When can he start? This guy's fantastic. Can I text in my vote?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The country, the United States of America is in trouble. We have an enormous deficit, and we only have until November 23, one week from this very night to slash $1.2 trillion from that deficit or we will not get our inheritance. Actually, I think that's a plot for 'Brewster's Millions.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My point is, if we are going to achieve that deficit reduction, we are going to need a hero. ... Ah, yes, the supercommittee. A group of 12 lawmakers who gained their powers after having been bitten by a radioactive accountant and are now called upon to slash our deficits. Go forward, supercommittee. The fate of the nation is in your hands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, it's Wednesday. And that means it's time for a new GOP front-runner. It makes sense Gingrich is rising. He appears to be the only candidate who appears to be made of dough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last weekend the President was in Hawaii. Today he's in Australia. Friday he goes to Indonesia. I think he saw the Republican debates and said 'Re-election's a piece of cake. I'm going vacation.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, Mitt Romney has moved up to like, 40% in New Hampshire for two reasons. Two reasons he's moved ahead Herman Cain and Rick Perry. That's why. You see, Mitt Romney, what a little shutting up can do? Don't say anything and you'll be fine!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These mistakes are starting to catch up to Herman Cain. In New Hampshire, he has dropped out of the top three and pollsters say he will soon touch bottom. In fact, touching bottoms is one of the reasons he has dropped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Cain is being criticized for his lack of knowledge on foreign affairs, but he denies that he lacks expertise in that area. In fact, today, Cain said when he becomes President, first thing he's gonna do, go to Iraq, meet with Saddam Hussein personally, and get this whole thing worked out. And Gadhafi, you're next!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And how stupid is this? At a town hall meeting in New Hampshire yesterday, Rick Perry said that no illegal immigrants would be allowed to attend. In fact, the event was held in an overgrown backyard with nobody to park the cars, and nobody to watch the kids. Yeah, so that was good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to 'USA Today,' there are 249 millionaires in Congress. So, see, crime does pay. You know, House of Representatives? It's more like a Mansion of Representatives, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congratulations to Newt Gingrich, 'People' magazine named him sexiest Newt alive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton visiting Manila in the Philippines and her motorcade was egged. Not so funny. Some Filipino punks egged her. Good thing she was wearing her Teflon pantsuit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess over the weekend, the President was gone out of the country, but a guy took a shot at the White House. Well they arrested the guy, they hunted him down and arrested the guy and they said 'What are you doing? He said, 'I thought I had a better shot at it than those Republican candidates.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The House of Representatives, did you hear this, the House of Representatives has passed a bill that would allow people to carry a concealed weapon from one state to another. In other words, my trip back to Boston for Thanksgiving just got a lot more interesting. I'm going to be packing at the Thanksgiving table. 'Say it again, just one more time. Who is a disappointment?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[On Gingrich's poll standings] &quot;Stunning. And not just because Gingrich is what you would diplomatically refer to as likeability-challenged.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So the names of the fallen sound out, Bachmann, Perry, Cain. Perhaps Ron Paul will now get his shot as the media front-runner. ... His poll numbers actually have been consistent, not mercurial. And you've given everyone else a chance. For God's sake, a woman who never entered the race, Sarah Palin, got more heat from the media.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So the media has basically declared all four of those other candidates dead, yet somehow the zombies continue to be allowed to the podium. You know why that freaks me out? These people don't even know they're dead. It's like the entire Republican primary is some type of M. Knight Shyamalan picture. You are getting better at condensing the story lines. Bachmann and Perry got to bathe in the spotlight of being the front-runner like two months each. Even Cain got a month before they declared him dead. So now, yesterday, Newt Gingrich is declared your front-runner, which means we'll soon be finding out new reasons why he sucks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Like all Americans, I have pinned my hopes and dreams on the 12 members of the super Congress. Kerry, Murray, Hensarling. I don't have to name them. We all grew up with the action figures. The origin story of the super Congress is well known. It was created last summer because of a freak rift in the debt ceiling continuum. The President wanted to raise the debt ceiling. The House refused to do that without budget cuts, and the US came perilously close to defaulting until at the last minute both sides found the courage to come together and let something else figure this [bleep] out later. Their later is our now. Unless this is a rerun, in which case you know how this turns out but don't tell me because I'm Tivoing the end of America.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an interview on Fox News yesterday, Governor Rick Perry attacked President Obama for thinking that he's the smartest guy in the room. He attacked him for being smart. One thing's for sure, nobody's ever going to accuse Rick Perry of that, boy. In fact, you know that No Child Left Behind program? He was the child left behind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know, it all gets so petty. In his new campaign ad, Rick Perry forgets to say the word 'is.' He said, 'That's what our President thinks wrong with America,' instead of saying, 'That's what our President thinks is wrong with America.' And when a reporter asked him, 'What's wrong with your grammar?' He said, 'Oh, she's fine. Grandpa's fine, too.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Herman Cain, while campaigning in Miami, was drinking coffee, and he asked the crowd, 'How do you say delicious in Cuban?' When he heard that, Rick Perry laughed and said, 'Everybody knows Cubans speak Mexican.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Also in Miami, a Fox News reporter asked Herman Cain what he thought of President Obama's easing of travel restrictions to Cuba, and Cain accused him of asking a gotcha question. He said that was a gotcha question. That's when you know things are bad, okay? When you're attacking Fox News for being part of the liberal media. That's never a good sign. When Fox News is part of the liberal media. I think he's gone from pizza to toast.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Energy Secretary Stephen Chu testified before Congress yesterday that he thought it was a good idea to lend $535 million of our tax dollars to the solar panel company, Solyndra, right before they went bankrupt. Yeah. He's our Energy Secretary. Do you realize if he'd taken all of that money, put it in a big pile and set it on fire, it would have produced more energy than Solyndra.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I mentioned the other night there are now 249 millionaires in Congress; 249 are millionaires. Remember a couple of years ago when this new Congress told us they had the solution to the recession? Apparently, they didn't share it with the rest of us. I guess they kept it to themselves, because it seemed to work out fine. There's 249 millionaires. So, it worked out good for them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, folks, US and Mexican authorities have seized 14 tons of marijuana. ... They say 14 tons is enough marijuana to supply the entire state of California for an hour.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a man in San Jose, California. who recently purchased a used minivan found a half-a-million dollars worth of cocaine stashed inside the door panel. Half-a-million dollars worth of coke in the door panel. Or as they call it in Colombia, a hybrid. That would be a hybrid car.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that Rick Perry, Governor of Texas? He's very cutting edge, although he seems right of center. He announced today to satisfy environmentalists he is now using solar power. And this is brilliant thinking, this guy is a visionary-- using solar power to run the Texas electric chair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I read that Texas Governor Rick Perry has challenged Nancy Pelosi to a debate. Yeah. Perry got the idea when he was like, 'I can't remember, am I good or am I bad at debates?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy birthday to Vice President Biden who turns 69 this weekend. When they saw him coming, White House staffers turned off the lights, hid behind the couch, and then waited for him to leave.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's some good police work. Officials in New York City have arrested an Al Qaeda sympathizer for allegedly planning a terrorist attack. You know, I hope Al Qaeda gets the message. If we want to be terrorized over Thanksgiving, we have our relatives come visit us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Police say the suspect is a 27-year-old US citizen who was originally from the Dominican Republic. Apparently, officials became suspicious when they found someone from the Dominican Republic living in New York and not playing for the Yankees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you seen 'Breaking Dawn,' the new 'Twilight' movie? It made $140 million over the weekend -- $140 million. You know, I think about how Congress and vampires are very much alike. They don't do anything during the day. They spend their evening seducing women, and then they just suck the life out of everything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, yesterday, the minute they announced that the supercommittee, or the 'blooper' committee as I call it, the supercommittee failed to reach an agreement on reducing the debt, the stock market crashed over 300 points. Yeah. You know, forget pepper-spraying students. How about pepper-spraying these idiots, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you know Herman Cain is the first Republican presidential candidate to get Secret Service protection? The level of protection a candidate gets depends on how well known they are. Like Cain, he's very well known. Well, he gets full protection. Jon Huntsman, he gets a ten-minute judo lesson and a plastic whistle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to 'The New York Times,' Jon Huntsman's father has paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for TV ads in New Hampshire. Jon Huntsman, Sr. said he would have gotten involved sooner, but he didn't know his son was running. I don't want to say Jon Huntsman is unknown, but you know what his Secret Service code name is? Jon Huntsman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, in a recent speech, Newt Gingrich called child labor laws 'truly stupid,' and he challenged laws that prevent children from working certain jobs before their mid-teens. So, the good news for Newt is if he doesn't get elected President, he can always get a job running a sneaker factory in China.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in an interview in 'People' magazine, Mitt Romney said, 'I tasted a beer, and tried a cigarette once as a wayward teenager, and never did it again.' Woo! What a rebel that guy is, huh? Doesn't drink, doesn't smoke, never did drugs, doesn't fool around. This guy wants to go to Washington? He has nothing in common with those people!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The truth is all these candidates have experimented. Rick Santorum, he once tried tolerance. Herman Cain, he once tried reading. Michele Bachmann once tried talking to a gay guy. Newt Gingrich once tried being faithful. That didn't work. And Rick Perry knows he tried something once, just can't remember what the hell it is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And another Republican debate earlier tonight. Has anybody seen any of the Republican debates? I mean when are they going to stop? I mean, this would be the very reason to call for a dictatorship, just to put an end to these. ... Newt was there, Mitt was there, Herman was there. Michele Bachmann was there checking coats.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Newt wants to repeal child labor laws. Ladies and gentlemen, this is the man that we need to lead us into the 18th century.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top Ten Supercommittee Excuses:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. Spent too much time picking a cool name for the committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Got distracted by Congress' new Donkey Kong machine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Wasted time trying on each other's hairpieces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. When your options are solve the national debt crisis or see the new 'Twilight' movie, you see the new 'Twilight' movie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Quit early to get in line for the Black Friday sale at Annie Sez.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. It's the curse of the chupacabra.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. We're assembling a special committee to come up with excuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. It's Robert Wagner's fault.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Hey, normally it takes us twice as long to get nothing done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. President Santorum will figure it out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;NASA announced that it has discovered 702 new planets in the last 20 years, which explains that new saying for remembering the planets: My Very Educated Mother Just Served Us Nine Pizzas, But Domino's Forget The Breadsticks, So We Called Them Up They Brought Them, But They Weren't Cheesy Bread Like We Asked For. They Were Cinnamon. Nothing Against Cinnamon, It Could Be Very Satisfying. We Just Weren't In The Mood.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight was the 14th Republican presidential debate, or as Barack Obama has started calling them, 'campaign ads.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;There was another debate between the Republican candidates for President tonight. ... This is their 14th debate and there are still 12 more to go. The plan, I think, is to keep debating until somebody recognizes Rick Santorum on the street.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich is now on top. Newt got 26% of the vote. Mitt Romney is now in second with 22%. At some point, Mitt Romney has to start taking this personally, right? It's like college. Eventually, the Republicans will settle down with Mitt but in the meantime they want to fool around with Rick, Herman and Newt first.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Mitt Romney did an interview with 'People' and admitted, 'I tasted a beer and tried a cigarette once as a wayward teenager and never did it again.' My goodness. It has the makings of the lamest 'Behind the Music' special yet. What a dark individual. And if you think that's bad, Jon Huntsman is now admitting that in college he experimented with parting his hair to the left.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;I don't know that that is the best way to relate to average Americans. Do we really want a President who has only had one sip of beer in his whole life? What if he's in the Oval Office one day, says, 'What the hell?' He drinks a beer; suddenly he's on TV in his underpants.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday on CNN, Herman Cain, he's doing an interview, and then he announced he was about to get hit with yet another sex scandal. And then an hour later, the new sex scandal broke. You know what that means? The man is psychic. We need him as President. He can predict the future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Herman Cain's latest accuser, a woman named Ginger White, said the affair with Herman Cain lasted for 13 years and she knew Herman Cain was married. Yeah, she knew. Just as the other four women who accused him of sexual harassment, they knew Herman Cain was married. In fact, the only one that didn't realize Herman Cain was married was Herman Cain. He had no idea.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this is my favorite part. Herman Cain says, yes, he does know the woman. Yes, he does know her. He's known her for 13 years. He said they were just friends, and that he occasionally wrote her checks to help her out financially. Guys, let me tell you something. If you're a married guy and you're writing checks to another woman, you might as well be having an affair because your wife's going to kill you anyway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, Herman Cain is now reassessing his candidacy. Apparently between his marriage, his mistresses, and then sexually harassing these other women, there's no time to campaign. His hands are full.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, in a huge upset for Mitt Romney, Newt Gingrich has gotten the endorsement of New Hampshire's leading newspaper, 'The Union Leader.' In fact, this is the best thing that happened to Newt Gingrich since they legalized no-fault divorce.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Joe Biden made a surprise visit to Iraq today, and it was a really big surprise, especially to Biden. Obama told him he was going to Cleveland.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A woman claiming she had a 13-year affair with Herman Cain. This is the latest. After he told his alleged mistress to prove it, she produced 61 phone or text messages from Cain. After that, Cain said, 'When I said prove it, I meant go away quietly.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a crazy story in Greenwich, Connecticut, three wealthy investors who were already worth millions won the $254 million power ball jackpot. Yeah in a related story, everyone's head at Occupy Wall Street just exploded.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some campaign news, in honor of Cyber Monday, Mitt Romney's website offered sweatshirts and t-shirts for 40% off. Not to be outdone, Herman Cain offered to take his clothes 100% off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, a woman came forward and said she had an affair with Cain that lasted 13 years. Yeah, 13 years. I don't know who the accuser is, but I'm pretty sure we can rule out Kim Kardashian.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, did you see this? In order to explain his 9-9-9 tax plan, Herman Cain just released a short cartoon. Unfortunately, today, he was accused of sexual harassment by Wilma Flintstone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new TV ad is running in Iowa, urging Sarah Palin to rethink her decision and join the presidential race. It gets weird at the end, when a voice says 'I'm Barack Obama, and I approve this message.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of Obama, the President will attend three fund-raisers in New York City tomorrow to raise money for his reelection campaign. Seriously? How about holding a fund-raiser to raise money for the United States. Hello?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Biden will travel to Turkey to speak in an economic summit. When he heard he was giving a speech to Turkey, Biden was, like, 'I am so sorry about Thanksgiving.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[On Herman Cain] &quot;Let's focus on the positive. Two things, one, 13 years? That is an admirable commitment to the woman with whom you are violating your spousal commitment with. And, two, after all those allegations about sexual harassment of underlings, nice to see Herman Cain going the consensual route. Kudos.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Voters leave Cain because they don't like he had an affair and go to the guy who had two of them? I guess Newt Gingrich becomes the candidate for people who like Herman Cain but think he was too monogamous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, this is devastating. Because of this, the former Godfather's Pizza CEO is considering the unthinkable. Cain says he's going to spend a few days off reassessing his candidacy. Herman, don't you leave this election lovers pizza half baked. I'm saying this not just as a supporter but as a broadcaster. I need you in the race!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Last night, another woman came forward with a story about Herman Cain. Which makes four or five now. When you have more women accusing you of sexual misconduct than you have toppings on your pizza, your campaign might be in trouble.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;He claims the reason he had her number and called and texted with her 61 times was because he was trying to help her financially. Interesting. I thought he was against welfare and handouts? When this new allegation came to light yesterday, Cain said it wouldn't affect his decision to run for President but this morning his chief of staff said he's considering dropping out of the race. The good news is, it will have no affect on his chance of winning the Presidency. I think, overall, I think the lesson is, if you want to know if your husband is cheating or not, have him run for President and you will find out. But I hope he stays in. I hope he sticks it out. I would love to have a President with 15 First Ladies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: [On Rick Perry's gaffe] &quot;Okay, mistake number one, the voting age in this country is 18, not 21. But that's only been the case for 40 years. And the election is not November 12th, it's November 6th. November 12th would be too late to vote. This is the funniest primary election ever, though. It really is, right? It's almost as if Rick Perry woke up this morning, read the news about Cain, saw all the attention he was getting and said, 'You're horny? Well I'm dumb!' And set out to remind us of that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a great day for America, but not a great day for Herman Cain. A day after being accused of having a 13-year affair, Herman Cain says he's now reassessing his campaign. Well, to put it more accurately, his wife is reassessing his campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not a great day for the British Embassy in Iran. The embassy was stormed by protesters. Not the peaceful kind with cute little masks. Iranian protesters broke in the embassy, ransacked the place, and set fires. It looked like a Wal-Mart after Black Friday in there.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Herman Cain continues to say he has nothing to hide. Well, at this point it's more like nothing left to hide. But he's trying. He's trying. Well, yet another woman has come forward. Her name is Ginger White. That doesn't sound like a stripper. Ginger White. And this is what? Woman number five, number six, something like that. Well, she claims she had a 13-year affair with Herman Cain. That's got to be tough, finding out you are the other, other, other, other woman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me ask you something. Women, 13 years. Is that still an affair? I mean, aren't you having anniversaries at this point? I mean, most marriages don't last that long. Anyway, this woman was on the news yesterday saying she was upset that her relationship with Herman Cain was being made out to be something filthy when, in fact, it was just a nice wholesome relationship between her and a married man. I'll bet that's why he had to leave his job at Godfather Pizza. You can't have a CEO that's cheesier than the pizza.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Herman Cain now says he is reassessing his campaign. Reassessing. Kind of the same way Conrad Murray is reassessing his medical career.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Newt Gingrich is surging, ladies and gentlemen. So much so, he's opened five new offices in South Carolina. Now political experts say the race is between Mitt and Newt. Mitt and Newt. Remember just a couple of years ago we thought Barack was an odd name for a President? Now we have Mitt, Newt and Barack. It's like the Hobbit is running this thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who I feel sorry for in this whole thing? Jon Huntsman. Because we don't even know who he is. He's running for President. He's a successful governor. Decent guy. Ambassador to China. Father of seven children. He's 1% in the polls; 1%. In fact, Huntsman is so desperate for attention, today he claimed he had an affair with Herman Cain while smoking crack.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And legendary Massachusetts Congressman Barney Frank, retiring after having served 16 terms. You know, usually when a Congressman leaves after serving 32 years, it's because they got paroled.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thanks to the recent repeal of a congressional ban, horse meat is now legal to sell for consumption in the United States. And I tell you, a lot of fast food chains are already jumping on this. Today, McDonald's introduces a new quarter horse with cheese.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a recent report by the Census Bureau, more residents are moving away from California than any other state. People are moving away. Yeah, as a result, California has changed its state motto to 'California, We Have Medical Marijuana.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Interesting fact. The NYPD has stopped and frisked more than 500,000 people this year. Which means if they frisk just 1,000 more, they'll tie Herman Cain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republican candidate Rick Perry is denying rumors that his top advisers are being demoted. Yeah. Perry was like, 'I want to make it clear that at no point in this campaign have I had any advisers.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Be honest. How many of you are just here because you got kicked out of Occupy LA.? Probably heard, after two months, the LAPD broke up the Occupy protest outside city hall here in Los Angeles last night. Which means it's time for the homeless people to go back to the library, where they belong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Police in riot gear came in after midnight and ordered the protesters out of the area. The situation was nothing, if not tense. ... It was late. Surprisingly, the police didn't find any drugs on the premises. Which means that the police are not very good at finding drugs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Almost 300 people were arrested because they refused to leave. But there was very little violence. The only thing the government does well these days is kick people out of parks. It is kind of funny; riot police arrested hundreds of people outside city hall, still less violent than Black Friday at every Wal-Mart in America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;So, Occupy LA encampment is over and with it; the world's longest hacky-sack game comes to an end. Now the park can be returned to its rightful owners -- crack salesmen.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Well, today, he went home for the first time, and it was easy to recognize his house. It was the one with the big 'Newt Gingrich for President' sign out front. I think the burning clothes in the driveway were another dead giveaway. But you've got to give Herman Cain credit. He is not ducking the issue. I mean, he's ducking the lamp and the flower pot and the ashtray.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in a campaign stop in Des Moines, Iowa, GOP presidential candidate, Newt Gingrich is starting to sound like Mr. Potter from 'It's a Wonderful Life.' You hear what he said? He said, 'Children in poor neighborhoods have no habits of working. No one around them works, and they get cash illegally.' So it sounds like they're training to become members of Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And at a book signing this week, Michele Bachmann said that in high school, even though she was a cheerleader, not one guy asked her to the senior prom. And it's not that she wasn't attractive, she was very attractive. It's just guys don't ask out cheerleaders wearing a giant 'Abstinence Forever' button.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, President Obama and his two daughters recently visited a bookstore in Washington, DC. Sisters in a bookstore. There's an episode of 'The Kardashians' you'll never see on TV.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone's talking about the 2012 election. Herman Cain will apparently decide this weekend if he's going to stay in the presidential race while Herman Cain's wife will decide if he's going to stay on the couch or in the basement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a new interview, it's revealed that Mitt Romney loves chocolate milk. These debates are getting complicated. Yeah. That's right, Mitt Romney prefers chocolate milk, while Rick Perry prefers milk like his poll numbers, 2%.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Listen to this, the Senate is doing its first ever secret Santa gift exchange this year. Yeah. There's a $10 spending limit, but they've planned to go $14 trillion over budget.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The FBI revealed that it found marijuana during a raid on an Amish house last month. It's hard being an Amish stoner, because you're like, 'Dude I have the munchies. Anyone want to harvest wheat, milk the cows, pick some tomatoes and make a pizza? Come on. Who's up for that?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, Herman Cain is scheduled to make a big announcement tomorrow. He says if his wife wants him to quit the race, he will quit the race. However, his wife's vote can be overruled by a simple majority of his mistresses.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, we have been having crazy weather here in Los Angeles. Trees blowing down. Power's been out. Schools have been closed. In fact, last night I got a call from Mitt Romney. He's trying to pick a position -- he wanted to see which way the wind was blowing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unemployment is down. People are out looking for work. In fact today Herman Cain applied at Domino's, Pizza Hut, Round Table, Little Caesar's. Just hitting them all.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, not surprisingly, Herman Cain suspended his presidential campaign. He made the announcement Saturday. He brought his wife with him so apparently he couldn't find a date. I guess he used up all his 9-9-9 lives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Herman Cain thought he could win. But, ironically, the closest Cain came to the White House was spending the night at Ginger White's house. That's as close as he got.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, President Obama is getting some flak for his planned 17-day Christmas vacation. That's a long time, 17 days. I mean, even Mary and Joseph only took the day off for Christmas. And they had baby Jesus -- they were back on the road the next day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To save money, the US Postal Service announced this week end of next-day service. That's a good way to get people to come back, isn't it? Make your service even slower than it already is. See, hard to believe they're having problems. I'm stumped.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Donald Trump announced he is going to moderate the Republican presidential debate later this month. Well, that should help end the criticism that the Republicans is the party of millionaires and billionaires. Yeah. Bring in Donald, the man of the people!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the head of the Federal Aviation Administration, a man named Randy Babbitt has been arrested for drunk driving in Virginia. Friends say it started when he fell into the wrong crowd -- pilots. Here's the scary part. You know what he was drinking while driving? Kamikazes. Yeah, that's even worse. Oh, man. Not good. And he sat in jail for less time than most of the planes sit on the runway. That's the unfair part.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's a sign of the times. Goldman Sachs, the big bank that caused the collapse of the world economy, Goldman Sachs, those guys, you know who I am talking about? Those beady eyed weasels, those money-grubbing thugs, this time of year they set aside a cash amount for bonuses end of the year. $10 billion. 'Bob, don't go in there, that's where we keep the billion dollar bonuses. Don't go in there.' Yeah, well, it's nice to know that they got the message, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you hear this. This is sad news. The post office is closing. They're closing. And I thought well that, on the one hand that's awful. On the other hand it will take the sting out of my hate mail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Herman Cain, remember Herman Cain? He suspended his campaign. He has asked the Secret Service if they could continue to provide him protection, at least until his wife cools off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm telling you now, here's one good reason why it's fun to be alive. Narrating or moderating the next Republican presidential debate, Donald Trump. Donald Trump. Apparently Pat Sajak was unavailable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about Newt Gingrich, come on! Do you have a dose of Newt fever? You can get that from swimming in the Amazon. ... I like Newt because he looks like your dad's old Army buddy, doesn't he a little bit? A little bit like that. And then he also looks-- have you seen that gout commercial? Where the guy is carrying a giant beaker of his uric acid? Newt reminds me of that guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But they say that Newt is a tremendous negotiator, a tremendous debater. Well, you know, of course, he's got three ex-wives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now Newt Gingrich today, today in New York City meeting with Donald Trump. Wait a minute, insiders say it was consensual.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of the Republicans, an upcoming Republican debate will be moderated by Donald Trump. It will take place in the Trump Forum for the Future of Democracy and Casino.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Jon Huntsman said he is not worried about his campaign because Americans are starting to take a second look at him. yeah. The reason they're taking a second look is because they don't know what he is still doing here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody is talking about the presidential election, and this is big. Two days after stepping down, there are rumors that Herman Cain is endorsing his former rival, Newt Gingrich. Not to be President, to be his new wingman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even though Herman Cain is suspending his campaign, he's launching a new website called thecainsolution.com. Yep. It's the only political website that makes you click an 'I'm over 18' button to enter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Herman Cain's farewell address, words of wisdom to his followers and supporters, the final moments of his campaign are from the closing credits of the Pokemon movie. The thing they play to get you the [beep] out of the theater. If I may quote from 'Titanic', 'Near. Far. Wherever you are. My heart will go on.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's Newt Gingrich's pitch. 'I'm the thing that has been in your pantry forever. You could try your new fangled Pop Tarts and your Eggo Waffles but if you look way back in there, there's a can of LaChoy baby corn, a product that may or may not still be offered by the LaChoy company. You don't remember buying it yet you don't remember ever being without it. And now, you have no choice but to elect it President. I'm Newt Gingrich and I approve this message.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Audience member and GOP front-runner Newt Gingrich released this actual tweet today. 'Stephen Colbert was brilliant at Kennedy Center Honors tonight.' Newt Gingrich said I'm brilliant, okay. And Newt reserves his twitter feed for things of the utmost importance like these actual tweets. 'I ate a Reese's peanut butter cup for breakfast. And Calista got me a Reese's peanut butter egg. It is good too.' And folks, for the record, Newt did not say that because he's a lobbyist for Reese's, they gave him $1.5 million because he is a well-known chocolate historian.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Herman Cain made a major announcement on Saturday at the grand opening of his new campaign headquarters in Atlanta; Mr. Cain announced that he is suspending his campaign. It was a grand opening and a grand closing at the same time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Cain blames a conspiracy by powerful Democrats who are intent on destroying him for these various allegations. I don't think you can blame the Democrats. I'm pretty sure they were rooting for him in this particular case.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Cain is expected to endorse another candidate. Many believe he will pick Newt Gingrich which makes sense because Gingrich is the only candidate made entirely out of pizza dough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Later this month the Republican candidates for President will face their toughest debate moderator yet on December 27th. The conservative news organization Newsmax will sponsor a debate moderated by Donald Trump. He's the perfect choice. You want someone who will keep the attention not on them but focused on the candidates and they'll have a slightly different format for this debate. Candidates will have one minute to answer the question and then Trump will get an hour to respond.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a sad day for Herman Cain. Over the weekend, he dropped out of the Republican presidential race. Some people are very upset about this. Those people are Democrats.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, as you know, Herman Cain has suspended his presidential bid. He denied again today allegations of sexual misconduct, and he thanked all his supporters for their gullibility, so I thought that was nice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Herman Cain's mistress of the past 13 years, this woman Ginger White said no one has offered to pay her any money for her story. But to be fair, nobody's buying Herman Cain's story either.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cain says he and his wife -- everything is fine between them. Though it's not certain the wife still trusts him 100%. Like today, Mrs. Cain called Michele Bachmann and asked if she could pray him gay. Does it work that way?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former Vice President Dan Quayle, remember Dan? That's right. Potato with an 'E.' He has officially endorsed Mitt Romney.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, Newt Gingrich met with Donald Trump yesterday. There's a good combination. Two guys, six wives, zero chance of either one of them ever becoming President of the United States.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you folks have heard by now that the post office is going away, it's closing. Boy, if only there was some easy quick, cheap electronic way to communicate. I don't trust mail that hasn't been licked.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think finally some good news the astronomers have found another planet earth. Did you hear about this? It's just like this planet, it's a little bit bigger and the temperature is a comfortable average 72 degrees. Almost identical to earth. One difference: There are fewer Dwayne Reeds. ... This new super earth is only 600 light years away. Yeah. If there's traffic, 700.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And how about Herman Cain? The Hermanator? Oh, my God. Herman announced he was suspending his campaign. This was the quote he said 'I will not be silent and I will not go away.' And then he stopped talking and left.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A few hours ago, Lady Gaga visited the White House. There was an awkward moment when Michelle Obama thanked her for the toaster and Lady Gaga said, 'That's my hat. Give it back.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On the campaign trail an eight-year-old boy approached Michele Bachmann and told her that his gay mom doesn't need fixing. That's what he said. He said, 'My gay mom doesn't need fixing.' Yeah, then he added, 'But my straight dad could sure use a drink.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Several journalists are reporting that when it comes to dealing with the press, Mitt Romney's staff is, quote, 'defensive and difficult.' In response, Romney's staff issued a statement saying, 'You're defensive and you're difficult.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, clearly, clearly Trump wants to be the new Republican kingmaker even before this debate announcement he had candidates lining up to kiss his gold ring! Which is not easy to find because it is the same color as his skin. Folks, this Trumptacular is still not serious enough for people like George W. Bush's former press secretary Ari Fleischer who called it 'an invitation to a circus.' Karl Rove who said, 'I think the Republican National Chairman ought to step in and say &quot;We strongly discourage every candidate from appearing.&quot;' Bush strategist Mark McKinnon who said 'This Trump debate is proof the inmates have taken over the asylum.' And today possible inevitable nominee and second-place front-runner Mitt Romney's decline of Trump's invitation which means there is a good chance tomorrow he will accept Trump's invitation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;I don't know if you heard this but the US Postal Service is in trouble right now, financial trouble. They lost $5.1 billion last year. And you know that $5 check your grandmother sends at Christmas? They lost that, too. Yesterday, the Postmaster General, which is a very fancy title for a guy who makes sure you get your Omaha Steak catalog, announced a plan to cut $2.1 billion from the budget. Twenty-eight thousand postal workers would be laid off and put an end to next-day mail service. Good, yes, make the mail slower. That is the way to save it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Now for those of you who don't remember Dan Quayle, he was Vice President back in 80s. During that quaint period when Republican Vice Presidents got in trouble for misspelling potato. Rather than for starting wars and water boarding people and shooting lawyers in the face. It was a whole different time.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to reports one of Moammar Gadhafi's sons had an elaborate plan to sneak into Mexico. Authorities broke up the plan before it took place.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. It's 2011. Why do you still have an answering machine?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. This is President Obama. I'm granting you a full pardon. No, I'm just screwing with you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. It's the warden. The inmates are asking how much you want for your seat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The 2012 elections, Republicans are trying really hard to woo Jewish voters away from President Obama. Yeah. For example, instead of talking about cutting taxes, they're using the phrase, 'Giving taxes a bris.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney's campaign announced that its official song is Kid Rock's 'Born Free.' Yeah. It narrowly beat out the first choice, 'Mr. Roboto.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Jon Huntsman said, this is a quote, 'We are in a deep funk as a people.' What is even sadder is that he gave the speech at 2:00 in the morning sitting alone in a booth at Appleby's.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, Donald Trump is in the news ... In his new book, Donald Trump claims he deserves credit for helping make Lady Gaga a star. Yeah. Trump's exact quote was 'It was my idea to go out in public with weird crazy [bleep] on your head.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new survey found that two of the most popular holiday songs are 'Jingle Bell Rock' and 'Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.' The least popular Christmas song, 'I Saw Mommy Kissing Herman Cain.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Donald Trump is hosting a debate in Iowa. But, so far, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum are the only presidential candidates to RSVP. Rick Santorum actually requested a plus one, you know, so he could bring all of his supporters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's start in Washington where last week the Senate passed the 2011 Defense Appropriations Bill, which authorized all the money for our Armed Forces by a whopping 93-7. Of course, the Defense Approbations Bill is one of those must-pass pieces of legislation. Every year you always see some crazy provision someone sneaks in there, like in 2007 it was intelligent clothing. We were going to pay to develop clothing that detects against chemical attacks. In 2009 it was Hawaiian healthcare network, and, of course, last year the flying bulldozer. ... Let's see what wacky provisions got folded into this year's bill. ... That is somewhat concerning, a bill that allows the government to lock up an American citizen indefinitely, without a trial, thus apparently nullifying the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution. I can see why seven senators voted against it. I would have thought we'd have like nine or a baker's dozen, but all right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama is going to veto this not because he objects to the Executive Branch having near infinite power to detain whoever it wants, but because he objects to the executive not having totally infinite power. Apparently there is a provision in the bill that says the President must detain foreign terror suspects in only military custody, unless he has a waiver. He's got to issue a waiver. The White House is going to veto this because they don't want to do any paperwork.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To be fair, if you do find yourself suddenly and perhaps capriciously imprisoned beneath this bill, you will have an opportunity to have your indefinite detention status reviewed once a year. They couldn't hold you indefinitely, just until the end of the war. So when the war on terror ends, and terror surrenders and is no longer available as a human emotion, you're free to go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll tell you who's not having great day. Rod Blagojevich. The former Governor of Illinois. Fourteen years he got in prison. He will probably get time off for good hair. ... He was convicted of trying to sell Barack Obama's vacant Senate seat. If he had waited a few years, he could probably sell it back to Barack Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, all of the Republican presidential candidates are in Washington, DC this week courting the Jewish voters. And while speaking to a prominent group of Jewish Republicans, Newt Gingrich promised to support Israel, not give in to the Palestinians and promised his next wife would be Jewish. I'm not sure Rick Perry got it. Like when they asked him what he'd do about the West Bank, he said, 'Bring back free checking.' Michele Bachmann didn't do much better. They asked her how she would deal with the Shiites, and she said 'Eat less fiber.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former New Jersey Senator and former New Jersey Governor Jon Corzine, who presided over the collapse of MF Global, told Congress under oath today, he simply had no idea where $1.2 billion of his customers' money went. He doesn't know where $1.2 -- he said I don't know where it went. Now we know who the MF is in MF Global, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to CNBC, a number of Americans are moving overseas looking for job opportunities. Americans are going over there looking for jobs. You know what that means? Now people over there will know what it feels like to lose their American jobs to foreigners.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mistletoe. Do you like mistletoe? It's everywhere, be careful and it's deadly, poisonous. Don't eat the mistletoe. But as a matter of fact, Rob Blagojevich, former Governor of Illinois stood under some earlier today and kissed 14 years good-bye.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They have discovered a planet just like earth, 600 light-years away and they are calling it Super Earth.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Governor Chris Christie who for a while looked like he might be one of the Republican candidates for President, he was at an event and he was heckled. They heckled him. And I thought, 'Now wait a minute, when is the last time Governor Christie was heckled?' It was a bunch of people waiting behind him in line at a Golden Coral.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Newt Gingrich is getting cocky because his poll numbers are surging. He's so cocky that he is already preparing his concession speech for November. That's how confident he's getting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I look at Newt and I think this guy is one hunting accident away from being Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today the White House held its annual Hanukkah celebration. Isn't that nice? It was a traditional Jewish ceremony, except for the part where it was hosted by a black man from Hawaii.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of President Obama, today when President Obama was asked to comment on Republicans who accused him of being weak on foreign policy, he suggested they talk to Osama bin Laden. Yeah. Then he dropped the mic and said, 'Peace out, bitch,' and walked off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of Christmas, Vice President Biden just mailed his family Christmas card which is signed with his dog Champ's paw print. The weird thing is Biden actually does that with all his important documents. 'Come here, Champ. Come on, boy! There you go, taxes are raised. There you go.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's an election update. This is kind of awesome. Newt Gingrich says he'll attend Donald Trump's debate in Iowa. Okay. But Rick Perry, Mitt Romney, Ron Paul, Jon Huntsman, all declined. That's just gonna be a weird debate when Trump is like, 'Newt Gingrich says he would cut taxes. How do you respond to that? Huh, Newt Gingrich?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have a good guest, Republican strategist Ed Gillespie will be joining us, I will ask him about the GOP Republican field and I will sit back and watch him weep, weep, like a child.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, talk of the 'War on Christmas' brings me to a fun fact. Did you know that not all Americans celebrate Christmas? It's true. Many American Jews celebrate a completely different holiday called 'How Come We Don't Get To Celebrate Christmas?' I kid. It's actually called the Republican Jewish Coalition Forum. It is celebrated every four years. For this holiday Jews commemorate the miracle of incredibly religious Christian presidential candidates fighting over who loves Jews more. And lo, God provided the Hebrews two good looking Mormons, though they had prayed for but one. Well, to be honest, none. They wanted Giuliani but that's not going to happen. So who will win the tuchus kiss-off?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the end the winner of the forum was one Newt Gingrich who received State of the Unionesque applause, standing ovations and the kind of laughter that Jackie Mason would kill for -- and has.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I sit down tonight with notorious lobbyist Jack Abramoff who has written a new book about Washington corruption. It's the perfect gift if you want to launder $26.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;There's an event later this month that I personally can't wait for. On December 27th, Donald Trump will moderate a debate between Republican candidates for President. Or at least that was the plan. Ron Paul, Jon Huntsman and Mitt Romney said they will not participate and today Rick Perry said he won't. ... Perry said he isn't skipping the debate because he has a problem with Donald Trump, he's just really bad at debates. Actually Perry gave three reasons for declining. First, he needs to concentrate on campaigning. Second, there are already two other debates scheduled for that week. And he forgot the third one. Oh, I remember. He said, 'I doesn't need Donald Trump to make me look stupid.' What he should have done was told him it's a rodeo. So far, the only candidates who said they will attend are Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich. This is just like when Donald Trump turned six and no one came to his birthday party.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah. Well President Obama celebrated Hanukkah at the White House last night. He lit the menorah, and then Vice President Joe Biden came in, sang 'Happy Birthday' and blew out all of the candles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a global study released just today found that happiness does not increase with the rate of economic growth. To which President Obama said, 'See? That's what I've been trying to tell people.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Lady Gaga visited the White House this week to discuss bullying. She went there to discuss bullying. Boy, was she upset when they said, 'Look, Rahm Emanuel doesn't work here anymore.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well Democrats in Hollywood now are starting to attack Republican front-runner Newt Gingrich. He makes millions of dollars for doing little work, he has ethical problems, he cheats on his wife with younger women. Why is Hollywood attacking him? He is Hollywood.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not saying Newt has a big ego. You know the difference between Newt Gingrich and God? God doesn't think he's Newt Gingrich.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum are the only two Republican candidates who have agreed to show up at Donald Trump's big debate. Even Santorum is getting shaky now. The rumors are Donald will either cancel the debate or round out the field with Omarosa, Dee Snider, and Gary Busey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former Senator and MF Global CEO Jon Corzine told Congress this week, he had no idea what happened to the $1.2 billion customers gave to his firm to invest. Isn't that amazing? Lost over $1 billion of other people's money, has no idea where it went. So apparently he must think he's still in the Senate. And ironically, in a related story, Jon Corzine's net worth estimated to be $1.2 billion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What a dopey story this is, after being kicked off an American Airlines flight for not turning off his cell phone, Alec Baldwin attacked the airline. He went on Twitter and attacked the airline saying that American Airlines is like a 'Greyhound experience.' Which is not fair. Greyhound actually has leg room. They don't charge you for extra bags. And you don't have to turn off your electronic device when you get onboard. Okay, Greyhound is actually better. The flight attendant said they kicked Baldwin off the plane to make it safer. And the head of the FAA had no comment because he was busy being arrested for drunk driving.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Randy Babbitt, he's the head of the FAA, forced to the resign after being arrested for drunk driving. I don't know how drunk he was, but when they pulled him over he thought he was circling Atlanta.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich sentenced to 14 years in prison this week. That makes him the fourth out of the last nine Illinois governors to go to prison. In fact, the Illinois State Penitentiary is the only one in the country that has a death row and a governor's row. Imagine you're an inmate in that prison. You're sitting in that cell, you're waiting to hear word from the governor and he's in the next cell!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Listen, you know the former governor from Chicago, Rod Blagojevich? He's been sentenced to 14 years, going away 14 years. ... Here's the thing, a lot of people forget about this, Rod Blagojevich when he was Governor of Illinois was trying to sell the Senate seat that was left open when Barack Obama ran for President. And that's what got him into trouble, trying to sell that. And I thought, 'I wonder if Obama would like to sell the seat he's in now?' I don't know. He might be, 'Make me an offer.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Part of the deal about Illinois, if you're the governor, you'll go to Federal penitentiary. That's just part of the deal. As a matter of fact, it's the only state where the current governor rides around in a car with a license plate made by a previous governor. It's a rich, colorful tradition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More good news for Newt Gingrich. Earlier today, he was endorsed by the voices in Glenn Beck's head.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Man, the 2012 election is really heating up. Yesterday, Mitt Romney's campaign said that Newt Gingrich has quote, 'No real world economy experience.' yeah.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Lindsay Lohan in the news again. In Hawaii this weekend, someone stole her purse with $10,000 in it. ... Luckily, she got the purse back. But, the $10,000 was missing. Yeah. It turns out the guy who stole it needed the money to pay off a bet with Mitt Romney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see that on the debate the other night? Mitt Romney tried to make a $10,000 bet with Rick Perry. $10,000 bet during a presidential debate. Well, who says the Republicans are the rich snobs out of touch with the common man, huh? Not Mitt Romney. You know what Newt Gingrich calls ten grand? A slow Tuesday at Tiffany's.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Newt thinks marriage should be between a man and a woman -- and then another woman. And then you leave her for the third woman. And then you fool around on the side.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Ron Paul, I mean well God bless the guy, we like the guy, we don't know anything about the guy. He looks like one of your old relatives. The guy that keeps sending you the blank emails.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But now the next Republican debate will be hosted and moderated by Donald Trump. Apparently they couldn't get Bob Barker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Poor President Obama. You know, mistakes are going to happen. I mean you can't be perfect when you're the President because the demands are incredible. ... So they light the big Christmas tree and bring it in. They go out to Pennsylvania and pay some old man and his wife 40 bucks and they cut down a tree. And then they bring it to Washington and they put it up. And then at some point during the holidays Chuck Schumer brings it in the trunk of his Buick, the White House menorah. So because the Obamas are going to be on vacation for the holidays, he said, 'Let's just go ahead and light up the menorah now.' And it turns out that the timing was completely wrong. They're off by a couple of weeks. .. Now people are saying, 'Wait a minute, you're telling me you can't look at the calendar and get the right day for lighting the menorah?' ... So sometimes this will happen, especially if you have a non-Jewish President. And I think we've had a few of those.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;GOP debate! Debate number 614! This is what everyone's talking about. During the debate the other night, Mitt Romney challenged Rick Perry to a $10,000 bet and Perry said, 'I'm not a betting man.' Yeah, Perry also said, 'I'm not a spelling man, a reading man or an adding man.' He has it down to three.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many voters feel that Mitt Romney's out of touch with real Americans after he tried to make the bet with Rick Perry for $10,000. When asked to comment, Mitt said, 'I'm sorry, but that's all I had in my pocket at the time.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're finding out more interesting stuff about Newt Gingrich. It's reported that one of Newt Gingrich's biggest fears is that a nuclear attack will shut off America's electricity. He has said that, yeah. Apparently Newt's afraid that it will happen while his Hot Pocket is still in mid-defrost.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During Saturday's debate, Michele Bachmann kept referring to Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich as Newt Romney. Experts say it's the closest she's come to endorsing gay marriage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The FDA is recommending that birth control pills be given more appropriate labels. They don't like the labels they have now. The FDA is especially unhappy with the pills labeled 'Unprotected Sex Skittles.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[On Romney's bet during the GOP debate] &quot;This is awesome. A Mormon gambling with an evangelical over who is the bigger liar. Are there any commandments left?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Newt Gingrich says he's against gay marriage. That explains why it's the only type of marriage he hasn't tried yet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Next up, folks, we are just 22 days away from the Iowa caucus. And Newt Gingrich has a double digit lead. Baffling the Washington predicto-crats, but folks I'm not surprised. He has got a good head on his shoulders, and a lot of it. Plus, he's not afraid to think of new ways to make us all afraid. So I'm giving a big tip of my hat to Newt Gingrich for repeatedly alerting the nation to an underreported threat, the electromagnetic pulse. Yes, an electromagnetic pulse would disable all electronic devices, all computers. The entire power grid shut down leading to the unthinkable. We would have to listen to those Amish bastards say, 'We told ye so.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, folks, Donald Trump has decided to cancel his Republican debate he was going to host later this month. The good news, he only has to tell two people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Newt Gingrich has sent a letter to the Iowa social conservative group The Family Leader taking a no adultery pledge. He's taking a no adultery pledge. He did that already three times. It was called a marriage vow, okay? ... He should make it a no more adultery pledge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Rick Perry was interviewed at 'The Des Moines Register' the other day. ... Well, at that appearance in Iowa the other day, Rick Perry did it again. He said there were eight Supreme Court justices instead of nine. But, in his defense, he did know there were only three judges on 'Dancing with the Stars.' ... He also referred to the energy company, Solyndra, as a country. He said the Obama Administration sent $500 million to the country of Solyndra. And it keeps getting worse. Like today, he said if he doesn't get the Republican nomination, he would love to serve as ambassador to the Latin country of Kaiser Permanente. Let's be real, if an energy company was a country, don't you think we would've invaded it by now?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Iran is now in possession of an American drone. When I heard that, I said, 'Oh, my God, they captured Joe Biden? Oh, my God.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Michele Bachmann still in the race for the nomination. She's picking running mates, Michele Bachmann picking running mates now. You know, that's like the Colts picking out Super Bowl rings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that Mitt Romney? ... Mitt says if he is President he will create 11 million new jobs. Sure, they'll all be in China, but still a job is a job, ladies and gentlemen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top Ten Signs The Candidates Have Debate Fatigue</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. Most frequent question from moderators: 'You awake?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Michele Bachmann's trying to get her husband to pray away the tedium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Newt Gingrich opened a revolving account with Sleepy's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. When asked a question, they all keep texting and mutter, 'Uh-huh, uh-huh.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Last night, Romney challenged Perry to a $10,000 game of 'Words with Friends'.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. They all walk around dazed and miserable. It's like working here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. At last debate, Rick Perry dropped his pants and said, 'Debate my ass!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Newt Gingrich released a statement promising he would not cheat on his wife. Even better, he said he wouldn't cheat on his next wife either or the one after that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, someone threw a pair of shoes at Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Yeah, Iran has captured the shoes and is studying their technology.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's almost the three-month anniversary of Occupy Wall Street and I would buy these guys a cake but they'd probably just complain about the icing inequality between the top and the bottom layer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These nationwide demonstrations are expensive. Just look at the generous portions of pepper spray and billy clubs they are handing out. It's an all you can beat buffet!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wisconsin Governor and TCBY employee of the month Scott Walker knows all about protests. Back in February, after he cut collective bargaining rights for public employees there were massive protests that Walkers' Administration says caused $7.5 million worth of damage. A figure that was later slightly modified to $270,000. Hey, they just rounded to the nearest $7.5 million. Well, to cover the cost of those demonstrations Walker is now implementing a bold new policy which will require protesters to pay for the right to protest. $50 per hour per capital police officer. $50! For a cop! I say that's a bargain! I mean this is a visionary initiative. This initiative will be phased in by December 16, just in time for Christmas. And, folks, Walker's policy stands on firm constitutional ground. After all, we all know freedom isn't free so it's logical that freedom of speech would cost money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Donald Trump announced this morning that he will now not serve as moderator at the GOP debate that was scheduled for December 27th. He said he had to cancel the debate because he's concerned for America's greatness and wants to be able to protect that greatness by running as an Independent candidate if he feels that's necessary. And also because only two of the GOP candidates decided to show up. This guy is something. He's committed to the debate, he's not committed, he's running, he's not running. He's in, he's out. What does he think this is? One of his marriages?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Meanwhile, Newt Gingrich just picked up a major endorsement for his presidential campaign. Gary Busey has officially and formally thrown his support behind the former Speaker of the House. He endorsed Gingrich then he endorsed a mailbox and the letter 'T'. Finally good news for Mitt Romney. You know the reason Gary Busey is a Republican? It's an interesting story. It's because he hallucinates more elephants than donkeys.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Iowa, where all the candidates are this week, 34 degrees. It was so cold; Rick Perry had a brain freeze without anybody even asking him a question. You know, have you been following this Rick Perry guy? Doesn't he remind you of that guy at the bowling alley who helps you with your shoes? Like you say I need a size ten and he gives you a seven and a three? Rick Perry has made so many gaffes lately; it is hard to tell if he's running against President Obama or Joe Biden. I can't tell.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, there was another big shake-up in the Republican primary. Ron Paul ... he has surged to second place in Iowa. He was only 1% behind Newt Gingrich. Now you know Ron Paul is in favor of letting states legalize marijuana, prostitution and cocaine. So even if he doesn't win, that's going to be one hell of an election night party, I'll tell you that.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, Newt Gingrich took a no adultery pledge. He vowed not to cheat on his third wife. You've got to respect a man who knows when he's cheated enough. You know. Okay. He's 68. How about a no Viagra pledge? That's what you need to take.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Boston stylist who cuts Mitt Romney's hair said that look is so distinguishable, men come in and ask for a 'Mitt.' That's what they say. They just ask for a Mitt and he knows what to do. And after they get that they head across the street to the girl walking on the corner and ask for a Herman Cain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And former US Senate candidate Christine 'I am not a witch' O'Donnell, remember her? Well, she has come out and endorsed Mitt Romney. And she said today, this is her quote, hand to God, she said, 'He has been consistent since he changed his mind.' That's the kind of clear thinking our politicians have become famous for. Isn't it? In other words, he's not flipped since he once flopped.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Donald Trump has canceled his Republican debate for later this month. Apparently there was a conflict. I guess his hair is appearing on a special 'is it real episode' of 'Mythbusters.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now Donald Trump says he may run for President as an Independent. Pundits say it's a long shot. He's known for performing miracles. Hey, he had a hit show on NBC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know Donald Trump? ... He was going to host the big Republican debate, and the Republican debates they do one a week. They're doing like 50 or 60 Republican debates. And Trump said, 'Okay, I'm going to host one.' And people started dropping out. They dropped out. They didn't want any part of Trump hosting the Republican debate. He announced that he's not hosting that debate, Trump. Well, I guess that's the last we'll hear of him. ... Seriously, what a blow to the debates. Honest to God, no Donald. Where are they going to find another pompous blowhard?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A campaign staffer on the Newt Gingrich campaign was fired because he was making negative comments about Mormons. I thought, 'Wait a minute, isn't Newt in favor of multiple wives?' I mean, honest to God. I think Newt Gingrich has had three wives. Let me see, yup, one for each chin.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New election scandal. Mitt Romney has received criticism for using the campaign slogan 'Keep America American' because that slogan was once used by the KKK. Now he is overcompensating because his new slogan is 'Mitt Romney, Straight Out of Compton.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney is facing a bit of an uphill battle in his race to be the Republican nominee. By uphill battle I mean nobody seems to want to vote for him, so he's decided on a...new tact. ... Romney is questioning Gingrich's conservative credentials. ... Seriously. Seriously. You're the guy who is so far to the left in his own party that this afternoon Fox News, this is true, accidentally used a photo of Barack Obama where a picture of you should go. And let me tell you something, that's not 'cause you guys look alike.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Tomorrow, we have a secret Santa gift exchange here. A lot of offices do this; even the Senate is doing it this year. Each Senator is supposed to buy a secret Santa gift for a Senator from the other party. The spending limit is $10. It's a hard limit of $10, but somehow there are already $127 million over budget.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;In American politics, I want to update you on a story we shared last night. Actor Gary Busey has now withdrawn his endorsement of Newt Gingrich for President. Is this a great election or what? Seriously. Gary Busey is involved. Gary said today it's not that he doesn't like Newt, but it was too soon for him to endorse anyone. He said as soon as a President is elected, he will let us know who he intends to vote for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;It hasn't been a great holiday season for Mitt Romney. He's trailing Newt Gingrich in the polls. He's taking a lot of heat for that $10,000 bet at the debate and today a blogger pointed out that one of his big campaign slogans is a rally cry that was used by the Klan. Ku Klux Klan, not Wu Tang.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The National Transportation Safety Board this week called for an all-out ban on cell phone use while driving. Headsets, Bluetooth, everything would be banned. Everything. I read that on my iPhone as I was coming into work this morning and I was stunned by this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to a new CBS poll, 33% of Americans say they won't have enough money to cover their holiday spending. I believe these people are called Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If President Obama and Congressional Republicans don't make a budget deal by midnight Friday, the government could shut down. That's what he said. If there is a shutdown, 800,000 non-essential Federal employees will be suspended. You know, maybe that's our budget problem right there. We have 800,000 non-essential Federal employees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a new poll shows that, for the very first time, the voters that view President Obama unfavorably outnumber those who view him favorably. In fact, if he gets any more unpopular, legally, he might have to run as a Republican.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ron Paul says that if he's elected, he would allow states to legalize marijuana, prostitution and cocaine. Well, he also claims the country's biggest problem is spending. You think Washington is spending too much now? Wait until they legalize marijuana, prostitution and cocaine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Rick Perry is about to embark on a 14 day bus tour of Iowa. Here's how bad his campaign is going, he's driving, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Newt Gingrich just signed a no-adultery pledge. Out of force of habit, he signed it 'John Smith.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Mitt Romney attacked front-runner Newt Gingrich again this week. He said, 'Zany is not what we need in a President.' He said Newt was zany. Newt Gingrich, zany? How boring are you if you think zany is Newt Gingrich?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Donald Trump has cancelled his debate because he says of a possible conflict of interest. Really, conflict of interest? How about lack of interest, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US Mint announced it's going to stop making the $1 coin. You know why? Because it's only worth 50 cents now, that's why.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night Barbara Walters had her 'Ten Most Fascinating People of 2011'. And you know who was one? Donald Trump. And by fascinating, Barbara means a self-promoting gas bag, but what a show. Don't kid yourselves. It's been a big year for Donald Trump. This year that thing on his head won a cat show.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the Republicans, boy, have you been following the Republican presidential hopefuls? It's exciting, isn't it? It's palpable, the heat coming off these people. I mean when you watch them you can't sit too close to the TV because it's just, 'Oh honey, bring me the lead apron. Ooh.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of the campaign, yesterday Gary Busey withdrew his endorsement of Newt Gingrich. Yeah, Mr. Busey has gone back to his prior position of endorsing a jar of raisins.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today on the campaign trail, Ron Paul said he does not like his milk homogenized. After this, Rick Perry said, 'I am also not a fan of gay milk.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First let's begin on the campaign trail with 'Indecision 2012, The Great White Hope.' As you know, Republicans are working overtime to keep themselves from having to spend next fall with a Mitt Romney sign on their lawn. They'll do anything to avoid that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Voters have test-driven everybody from Bachmann to Perry in increasing desperation. With the first vote finally in sight, it appears that the ride may have arrived in form of a White 1994 Chevy Capricious. ... Wow. Yes, it appears that Newt Gingrich will be the 'nah-miny' even if he believes it rhymes with 'hominy'. I would say tonight to the Republican primary voters. Don't do this. Seriously. I know you're mad. I know you're madder than usual. The country is being run by a foreign-born Hawaiian, radical Christian Muslim, Socialist who is in the pocket of Wall Street and sometimes Newt Gingrich can sound like the answer. ... So here's the thing, he's not Reagan. He's more like a Norman Rockwell painting of Ayn Rand kicking Jimmy Carter in the balls. Listen, Reagan had a certain charm and gentility. Gingrich is like what would happen if Reagan had been abandoned as a child and raised by a family of cactuses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Tonight in Sioux City, Iowa, another debate between the seven Republicans running for President. All your favorites were there. Grumpy, Dopey, the other Dopey, Romney, Bashful. Another dopey. And Happy. This was the 427th of 2,000 debates to be held between now and when President Obama is re-elected. There are so many debates. For a group of people who don't want the government interfering in our lives a lot, they interfere in our lives a lot. Tonight's debate was sponsored and moderated by Fox News. I thought Fox was being festive by having a snowman on stage, but about an hour in, I realized the big round white thing was Newt Gingrich.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the Pentagon, an American drone captured by Iran now appears to be a fake. See, did Iran really think they can fool us with the fake? We're the country of breast implants, hair extensions, and collagen lips. We invented fake, okay. We know fake. Thank you very much!&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And 'USA Today' reports that the number of death row executions this year has hit a 35-year low. They attribute that to DNA evidence clearing more people and the fact, of course, that Rick Perry has been on the road campaigning. He just hasn't been back home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During the Republican debate last night, Rick Perry compared himself to Tim Tebow. He said he's the Tim Tebow of Iowa. The big difference, Tim Tebow actually has a prayer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Republican candidates all had their different positions on the Federal Reserve. Ron Paul, anti-Fed. Mitt Romney, of course, pro-Fed. And Newt Gingrich, overfed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Gary Busey has just withdrawn his endorsement of Newt Gingrich. That's when you know your campaign's in trouble, okay? When Gary Busey takes a step back to think things over. No, Gary said today before he makes another endorsement, he's going to consult all of the voices in his head.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama now says he didn't know how bad the economy was when he took office. And if it doesn't improve soon, that's what the next President is going to be saying.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The war in Iraq finally over. Thank God. Think about this, nine years ago when we invaded Iraq it was a lawless, divided nation on the verge of chaos and collapse, and today, well, today, it's Pasadena. It's a wonderland. Everything is fine. I'm buying a place there. I called Century 21. The war lasted nine years, nine years. Let me give you an idea how long that is, nine years-- that's 46 Kardashian marriages. We succeeded in establishing democracy in Iraq, and now, if only we could get one here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been a crazy week. What happened this week? Mitt Romney went on the attack. He said, and this is true, he said Newt Gingrich was too 'zany' to be President. Too zany? Gingrich has been here. He's many things. He ain't zany! Them's fightin' words. Newt Gingrich responded by tossing confetti in the air, squeezing a car horn and then spraying seltzer at Mitt Romney's crotch.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well in North Korea they announced the passing of their Supreme Leader, Kim Jong-Il. His younger son will take over. At first, there was speculation that power could pass to one of Kim's two sisters, Kourtney Jong-Il or Khloe Jong-Il.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Michele Bachmann, as you know, foreign affairs not her strong suit. When she was told of the Supreme Leader's death she said, 'I didn't even know Diana Ross was sick. I had no idea.' And Rick Perry didn't fare much better. When he was told about Kim Jong-Il, he said, 'I never heard of him, but then again, I don't listen to that rap music.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, during the debates the other night, Rick Perry compared himself to Tim Tebow. You know what Rick and Tebow have in common? Both their seasons will end before February.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Donald Trump ... He is saying now that he will probably run for President again. I mean we went through this. Last year he said he was going to run for President and then he didn't run for President. But this time he may be serious because I understand he has demanded to see his own birth certificate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That Newt Gingrich, how about that guy? He is demanding that that judges be arrested. He's threatening that we could arrest judges and I thought 'Whoa, that's what two divorces will do for you.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Kim Jong-Il, the evil dictator of North Korea, guess what, dropped dead and now everybody's worried about will take over for Kim Jong-Il. They think it's going to be his idiot son Kim W-Il.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. Isn't it time for a President who looks like a 1970s game show host?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. What's up gangstas? It's the M-I-Double-Tizzle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. I have no proof, but I have a feeling Canada is planning something.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Actually, I'm only here to meet Tom Cruise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Live from New York, it's Saturday night!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. My new cologne is now available at Macy's. It's 'Mitt-stified.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. I just used all my campaign money to buy a zoo with Matt Damon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. I can do a lot, but even I can't fix the Indianapolis Colts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Newt Gingrich? Really?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. It's a hairpiece.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il died of a heart attack. That was the cause. No one knows what triggers it. He had a lot of money riding apparently on the Denver Broncos so he was pretty upset.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Crazy strange facts are coming out about Kim Jong-Il today. It is being reported, this is true, that school children in North Korea were taught that Kim Jong Il did not urinate or defecate. That's true, yeah. So today, most school children in North Korea assumed that their fearless leader exploded.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Marcus Bachmann in the news, while campaigning for his wife, he said it was a myth that 10% of the population is gay. He said 'In my house, it's more like 50%.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Weird story, it's being reported, I don't know if you know this, the new meth capital of America is Missouri. ... Missouri unseated last year's meth capital of America, the set of 'Two and a Half Men.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kim Jong-Il, you know, the crazy leader of North Korea, who hated us, that guy -- he passed away over the weekend. And get this, his 28-year-old son Kim Jong-Un is taking over. It won't be easy, because he's got some big women's sunglasses to fill.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Korean dictator Kim Jong-Il died on Saturday. Hey, that's pretty rare. One of America's greatest enemies dies and Obama had nothing to do with it? 'Hey, this one's not me. This one's not me!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama's approval rating actually went up last month to 49%. Now, let me ask you something.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, during the Republican debate the other night, Rick Perry compared himself to Tim Tebow. He said he's the Tim Tebow of Iowa.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if you heard about this, but a couple of weeks ago Barack Obama because he was going to be out of town he decided that he would light up a menorah, like three weeks ago.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Russia announced this week they are building a 100 ton monster nuclear missile they call Satan. The missile is called Satan. You know, I don't think they're as into Christmas as we are. I just don't get that feeling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the pro adultery website AshleyMadison.com. Have you heard of this? ... Well, it's a website for married people that want to cheat.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Sarah Palin is dropping hints she might jump back into the race for President because she is not impressed with any of the candidates so far.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, there's been a lot of change in the polls though lately. It's unbelievable. President Obama's ratings are up.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's talk about Kim Jong-Il, his body is lying in state in North Korea and this story came out today.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier this week, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez called President Obama a clown and an embarrassment. Hey, let me tell you, you don't talk about our President that way. Our Vice President, sure, that would be fine, but not our President.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wisconsin Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner is now apologizing after attacking Michelle Obama's body type. He said, 'She lectures us on eating right while she has a large posterior herself.' Isn't that insulting? Well, here's the worst part. Here's a photo of Jim Sensenbrenner. Hello? Come on! Isn't that like Newt Gingrich attacking you for cheating?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's a wonderful Christmas story. An Arizona man, a guy believed to be brain dead, a guy who was poised to be an organ donor. He was like hours away from being an organ donor, miraculously recovers just hours before doctors were going to take him off life support. The guy was brain dead, and now he's on the road to recovery. You know what that means? There is hope for Rick Perry. They can maybe do something.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Barack Obama had time to go shopping. And I think that's a good sign, we see he's just one of the guys. He goes out, he does some shopping. Now he took the entire White House Press Corps with him, but still he's out there boosting the economy. You know, the Chinese economy but still, he's doing what he can, ladies and gentlemen. And at the end, like they have you sign the credit card thing and it was a big deal. He used 15 different pens ... then he took his dog Bo to Petco and bought him a new flea collar and coincidently Newt Gingrich brought his dog to Tiffany's and bought him a diamond muzzle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'The New York Daily News' reported that Obama bought the Wii game, Just Dance, for his daughters Sasha and Malia.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a new interview, President Obama was asked to describe Michelle and he used the words 'beautiful, smart, and funny.' When asked how he picked those, he used the words, 'She's sitting right next to me.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

He had to go to Best Buy because he is not allowed to go to Wal-Mart because China said, 'Hey, you can't buy any more stuff until you pay us what you already owe us. You are out of here. Take a hike.' While he was shopping at Best Buy out of force of habit President Obama put everything on lay-away. He told the store, 'Don't worry about it, our grandkids will pay for it.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the independent super PAC supporting Mitt Romney announced it will suspend anti-Newt Gingrich ads during Christmas Eve and Christmas day. They said they're doing it out of respect to Gingrich, his family, and his mistresses.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the Immigration Bureau, illegal immigration is at its lowest point since the year 2000.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kim Jong Il, the evil murdering dictator of North Korea, passed away. I think we have a shot of him. See what this is. This is a glass, a sarcophagus and he was beloved by millions of fellow North Koreans, and so beloved that it's bullet-proof glass. They would come in and take a couple of shots and riddle the corpse. ... But what happened there was a lot of grief and hysteria and it was all fake when this guy died.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today are the Republican Iowa caucuses, huh? Or, as it's also known, 'Old White Guy Mardi Gras.' Here's the latest, political analysts are saying that Mitt Romney is having trouble generating enthusiasm among Iowa voters. Now, ladies and gentlemen, you know you have a problem when people in Iowa find you dull. He lacks that Iowa sizzle, he does.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday Newt Gingrich was asked about the Iowa caucus, and he said, 'I don't think I'm going to win.' It was funny, because that's how Jon Huntsman answers the phone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And there's a plan for the Pentagon to cut almost half a trillion dollars from the military. Cut half a trillion dollars from the military. Yeah. The Pentagon plans to pay for future wars by divorcing Kobe Bryant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some big election news, you guys. Today was the Iowa caucus, and listen to this. The Duggar family, from the show '19 Kids and Counting' are endorsing Rick Santorum for President. Yeah. The Duggars said if Santorum needs more voters, they'll just make them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US government is selling $30 billion worth of fighter jets to Saudi Arabia. Yeah. Part of a new initiative called 'Operation Regret This In Five Years.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama's campaign has released a highlight reel of his top moments from 2011. The video is a little weird. Halfway through, it's taped over by Joe Biden's recording of 'Yo Gabba Gabba.' It's like, 'Joe, use your own tapes.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously I know that tonight you're excited to hear the results of today's Iowa caucus. I do not know them. ... But I can tell you what I do know. The Republican presidential race and the conservative voters' desperate effort to explore every other possible option, living or otherwise, before ultimately and unhappily voting for Mitt Romney is the rite of passage for Republican voters known as 'Romspringa.' Yes, Republican voters know they're going to end up with Romney much in the way a 16-year-old Amish boy knows his six months with an iPod will ultimately give way to several decades of hand-tooled barn building.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, when our show left in December. Newt Gingrich was Republicans' temporary vice. Which ended much in the way the young Amish's first encounter with alcohol ends-- nausea, vomiting and a vow to the Lord never to go near that [bleep] again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Santorum. Really? Republicans are going to try every chocolate in the box? Look, here's your candidates. Let's call it a 'White Man's Sampler.' All right, here we go. You got them all in there? You're going to end up with the plain chocolate. You just are. You tried the Bachmann over here, too many nuts. All right. No good. Perry. Oh, the Perry looks great. ... But guess what? Almond nougat. Who puts almond nougat in chocolate? You tried all of them. All of them except this one. This is the one you never tried because you know it sucks. This one? That's Santorum. It's the one that has the cherry [bleep] on the inside. The one you try and pawn off on one of your cousins.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You end up with Romney, the least bad chocolate. And, by the way, when you do ultimately end up with Romney, don't try and pretend this is the chocolate you wanted the whole time. You're going to be miserable, not because Romney flip-flops or pretends he's an ordinary fellow trying to make in the this blue-collar world, but because even Romney's good ideas reek of John Kerryesque out of touchedness. Did you watch the coverage of Times Square on New Year's Eve? Did you see Mitt Romney bought the space behind the ball in Times Square. That's smart. Makes perfect business sense. Unless, of course, your business is getting people like you. It's like those ads right above urinals. Your first thought is 'That's a great idea, people can't go anywhere, and they have to look at it.' Then your second thought is 'I hate whoever put this here.' So that's your guy. Eat up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, it's good to be back because tonight is the biggest political story of the century. The Ohio, no, I'm sorry, that is the Iowa caucuses. The caucusi? Let's check on that. Either way, it's the Super Bowl of old mid-western people in a high school gym sitting in folding chairs. ... Now, normally we broadcast live at 11:30 every night. But tonight I am pre-taping my show at 7:00 so I could get home in time to catch the start of the hyping of New Hampshire. But just because it is impossible for me to know the winner of Iowa yet, that will not keep me from being the first to call this race. I can already say who will lose-- Jon Huntsman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;The big news tonight, the first round of balloting in the race for the Republican nomination for President, the Iowa caucuses. The way a caucus works is, a group of voters gather in a public place. Someone stands up and speaks on behalf of each candidate and everyone writes their selection on a piece of paper and hands it in and they count it and -- it's about as scientific as a Secret Santa gift exchange.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Herman Cain is now back in the mix on cable television. He told Barbara Walters a couple weeks ago that if a Republican wins the election, he would consider being named Secretary of Defense. For real. ... Maybe he thinks defense is an actual fence he would be secretary of. I don't know. We have to get him back in the race. I don't care how. Somebody please make him a running mate. Please?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While I was in Scotland, the world said goodbye to one of the last old-school dictators. Kim Jong Il. ... The new ruler of North Korea is Kim Jong Il's son. That's an amazing coincidence. The elections must have gone very quickly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today of course in Iowa, it is the first big Republican caucus. ... But I don't know how a caucus works. ... I think what happens is someone gets voted off the island and the rest of the candidates get a rose.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What a crowd! Thank you very much. You sound like the people in Iowa when all those damn candidates finally went home. As you know, the Iowa caucus was the first stage of the Republican nominating process. The remaining stages are 'I don't care' and 'I've lost interest completely.' Those are the other stages.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Rick Santorum did surprisingly well. Well, he came in second. He lost by only eight votes. Just eight votes. Do you know what's ironic? He could have won if he had just gotten the gay vote.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, it was so close; they're calling it a victory for Rick Santorum. His campaign is celebrating. Did you see him last night? They were celebrating with a pizza party. They had pizza. Here's the embarrassing part. It was delivered by Herman Cain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A restaurant in Boone, Iowa, named its chicken salad after Rick Santorum. They also have the Mitt Romney waffle, the Ron Paul cracker, and the Newt Gingrich chubby hubby ice cream. So they have the whole spectrum.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was one awkward moment yesterday when they asked the presidential candidates about their New Year's resolutions. And Rick Perry said he doesn't believe in resolutions. He said, 'I believe in Adam and Eve.' I don't think he understood.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Highway safety officials announced this week we are driving safer, and there are fewer traffic deaths. Experts say because the bad economy means more cars are being repossessed, and all the unemployment means we don't have as many people driving to work. So you know what that means? The White House economic plan is also their highway safety plan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, and National Guard troops on the US-Mexican border will be cut to about 300 from 1,200 by the end of March. Apparently they're being replaced by people sneaking over the border who will do the job for half price.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, this just in, ladies and gentlemen. As I was coming out here, CBS News has predicted the winner the Iowa Republican caucuses: President Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I mean it's like we don't know how to run an election in this country. Already controversy with the Iowa caucuses, you know what I'm talking about? About a half hour ago they found eight more votes for Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So anyway the results of the Iowa caucuses, Michele Bachmann is out. I don't think her husband is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that Rick Santorum? He came in second because Rick Santorum is the anti-Romney. Wait a minute. I thought Mitt Romney was the anti-Romney. ... Romney has changed positions so many times he's planning to run attack ads against himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rick Perry got himself beat up pretty bad in Iowa. He's going to South Carolina and start taking care of business down there and he says the three things that he needs to concentrate on to rebuild this campaign: financing, got to have financing, very expensive to run. Voter support got to have your voter support and number three, whoops. He still can't remember number three.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top Ten Surprises At Michele Bachmann's Press Conference:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. Congratulated Mitt Romney on being elected the President of Iowa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Gave repeated shout-outs to the Los Angeles car arsonist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. After a brief introduction, spent fifteen minutes Tebowing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Said she successfully prayed her campaign away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Shared several inspirational quotes from 'Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Announced plans to bet remaining campaign funds on the Packers to win the Super Bowl.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Said she's leaving Marcus for the lead guitarist of Journey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Revealed she's the latest wacky character played by Sacha Baron Cohen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Showed her full-body dragon tattoo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Ended with 'See you losers at the truck stop.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney won the Iowa caucuses by defeating Rick Santorum by only eight, eight votes. That's a record. To give you an idea of how close that is, if all of Newt Gingrich's ex-wives voted for Santorum, he would have won by 15.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Michele Bachmann has dropped out after last night. In her concession speech, Michele Bachmann said, this is a quote, 'I mean what I say and I say what I mean.' Yeah. Then she thanked her speechwriter, Popeye.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rick Perry finished in fifth place with only 10% of the votes. Yeah. When asked if he was dropping out, Perry said quitting is not in my vocabulary and 'neither be most other words.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big story today, John McCain has endorsed Mitt Romney for President. Now, it didn't help that McCain began his endorsement by saying, 'From the man who brought you Sarah Palin.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh man, everyone is talking about last night's big Iowa caucus. Mitt Romney, Rick Santorum and Ron Paul were in a three-way tie for most of the night. When he heard they were in an all-night three-way, Herman Cain was like, 'Seriously, how am I not in this thing?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was an exciting night. Rick Santorum came of within eight votes of defeating Mitt Romney. While Jon Huntsman came within eight votes of having eight votes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After six hours of mostly unnecessary coverage, actual caucus results trickled in. The two biggest losers, summertime Iowa poll winner Michele Bachmann and Texas stereotype Rick Perry, who continues to be one of my favorite candidates for his completely unjustified enthusiasm in the face of a fifth-place ass kicking. ... [as Rick Perry] 'Whoo! What's up everybody? I spent a [bleep] load of money in Iowa and didn't get a whole lot of votes. What's up? I had a hell of a time. I think my campaign might be dead in the water but our hotel is cool as [bleep]. ... By the way, I got crushed.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Newt Gingrich came in fourth. Three weeks ago he was in the lead until an intense series of negative ads from the Romney super PAC pummeled him, but I'm sure he was gracious about it. ... That wasn't a concession speech. That was like a thinly veiled, passive aggressive speech that an individual makes right before they slink away to a skull-shaped cave in a volcano and reemerge in five years as super villain Von Gingrich, the Dark Lord of Chaos.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, Romney could afford to be gracious. Well, he can afford pretty much everything. How expensive can gracious be? But I imagine his eight-vote victory validates his campaign strategy to say anything that will give him an eight-vote victory.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's Mitt Romney's problem. Even in victory his self-described committed conservative ordinary guy persona feels like it came from a committed conservative ordinary guy kit he got from Hamaker-Schlemmer for $14 million.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Forgive me if I'm a little jittery. I was up all night last night watching the Iowa caucuses, and today I may have had one too many venti meth-a-ccinos. As you know, Mitt Romney was not declared the victor in Iowa until 1:30 a.m., and Mitt usually doesn't stay up that late unless he's got heartburn from a particularly spicy wheat thin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sadly, it was a rough night for Newt Gingrich, coming in fourth place thanks to a blistering barrage of negative ads. In December nearly half of all political commercials in Iowa were attacks on Newt Gingrich ... Oh, Mitt, you have made a fatal mistake. You may have wounded Newt but you left him alive. And alone with his first love -- hate. Newt's wound will now fester, oozing a pustulent rage which will render down into liquid vengeance and then pour into the tip of a single hollow-nosed bullet and then fire into the heart of Romney's dreams and dance and cackle on the grave of your hopes. But not in a negative way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Did any of you watch the Republican caucus last night in Iowa? ... In case you didn't see the results from last night. Here is how the candidates fared. Mitt Romney just barely finished first with 25% of the vote. Followed very closely with Rick Santorum with 25%. Ron Paul with 21% in third. Newt Gingrich in fourth with 13%. In fifth, Rick Perry, he got 10%. Michele Bachmann finished sixth with 5%. In seventh was a bottle of ketchup, followed by Snooki in eighth and last place, Jon Huntsman. I think that might add up to be more than 100%.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;But there those of you might not know who Rick Santorum is. You know the boring stuck-up white guy you see in every Tyler Perry movie? That's him. He usually wears a sweater vest, which is puzzling. I don't know how a guy can be against gay rights but for sweater vests. If that isn't flip-flopping, I don't know what is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Minnesota Congresswoman Michele Bachmann dropped out of the race this morning. Actually, she suspended her campaign. She's done running but hasn't officially dropped out. That's so she can still qualify for Federal matching funds to pay off her campaign debts. In other words, she racked up a bunch of bills and now that she's gone belly up, she wants the Federal government to help bail her out. Which is pretty much exactly what she is upset at President Obama about, right?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a great day for America, everybody. Yes, indeed, it is. It is not a great day for Texas Governor Rick Perry. In the Iowa caucus he came in fifth place. Last night he said was quitting the race. But then this morning, he said he's staying in. Hmm. Going back on his word? Maybe he'd make a good President after all.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, folks, it is on to New Hampshire. That is the next big primary. Next Tuesday in New Hampshire. Yesterday, Senator John McCain endorsed Mitt Romney. He also endorsed the Clapper, Ensure and the Life Alert.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Mitt Romney was the big winner and not big winner in Iowa. He only beat Rick Santorum by eight votes. Eight votes. In fact at one point Santorum almost withdrew because he didn't want to finish that close to another man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Mitt Romney now is starting to go after President Obama. He says President Obama's promises are like Kim Kardashian's wedding vows. Hey, President Obama shot back. He said Romney's positions last about half as long as a Kim Kardashian wedding.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Michele Bachmann is the latest Republican to officially withdraw from the race. You know what's interesting? I'll tell you. Michele Bachmann said God called on her to run. And now she's out. Herman Cain said God called on him to run. And he's out. And Rick Perry said God called on him to run. And he's almost out. You know something? It does not look good for Tim Tebow in the playoffs. Okay? I'm just saying.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And earlier today, President Obama unveiled his plan to shrink the size of the military, to which Rick Perry said 'Why do we want shorter soldiers?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rick Perry, God bless him. He is not quitting. Even though he came in fifth, he is not quitting. He said it's on to South Carolina. And then today, he said, 'Which way is that? Anybody know?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a man who calls himself the grand warlock of Mexico has predicted that President Obama will not win re-election. The grand warlock's real name? Juan Hannity.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Michele Bachmann who wanted to be President, lovely woman, born in Iowa, I guess. Wanted to be President and she quit. She said she's not going to run any more. She's tired. The last day of the campaign there in Iowa her husband, Marcus, you know Marcus, he went out the last day of the campaign he went out and bought sunglasses for their dog. I mean every woman's dream. I mean really? You take the poodle into Lenscrafters? When Rick Santorum heard about this he went out and bought his dog a sweater vest.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. New campaign slogan: 'What up, Gingsta?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Since Losing Iowa, he's married and divorced eight different women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Has EMTs standing by at all times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Quit campaign to buy zoo with Matt Damon ? still in theaters, people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. When he hears the word 'caucus' drops his pants and says, 'I'll show you a caucus!'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. In every speech, he attacks Walter Mondale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. His New Year's resolution? Be doughiest man he can be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Makes cameo appearance in Casey Anthony's new video blog.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Losing it? When did he ever have it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Claims he was born in Kenya.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Presidential candidate Rick Santorum is under fire for a remark he made in Iowa about black people. People are upset about it. The remark has sparked outrage among Iowa's black community, otherwise known as Steve.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney has come under fire for his pledge to eliminate Federal funding for PBS. Yeah. Romney said, 'When I'm President, the only operated puppet speaking to kids will be me.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's some cool election news. I read that Facebook is hosting a Republican debate on Sunday. Candidates will be seated based on their poll numbers with Romney in the middle, Gingrich on the side and Rick Perry down at the MySpace debate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This month marks the tenth anniversary of George W. Bush's No Child Left Behind law. Or as kids in the US put it, 'Ten? That's almost seven.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The GOP presidential race is heating up, Romney and Santorum tied in Iowa, Perry soldiering on and Michele Bachmann dropping out to spend more time fiercely staring at her family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After his surprise photo finish in Iowa, Rick Santorum is the new GOP golden boy. Which explains why Ron Paul has tried to stamp him into coins. Just one day since the caucuses, Santorum raised a million dollars or as Rick Perry calls it, five Iowa votes. For the Santorum surge just got real, ladies and gentlemen, because he has caught the notice of the most influential voice of the 19th century, George Will who published a pro-Santorum op ed entitled 'Suddenly a Fun Candidate.' And if anybody knows fun, it's George Will. ... Because without fun what would Republicans campaign against? And folks, you want fun? Santorum is the life of the party. Heck, he's the pro-life of the party. There's this great drinking game where you take a shot every time he says the words partial-birth abortion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, of course no one came out harder against this bill [National Defense Authorization Act] than Barack Obama who vowed to veto it. Fortunately, President Obama was smacked down by a man with some balls, Commander-in-Chief Obama who signed the NDAA into law on December 31st. Happy New Year. Now he knew that by doing this his voters wouldn't like it. So the President added a signing statement that said 'I have signed this bill despite having serious reservations.' He signed it but said it was wrong. That is called standing on your principles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the real stroke of genius here was when he added, quote, 'My Administration will not authorize the indefinite military detention without trial of American citizens.' Notice how he said 'My Administration.' The President can now have you snatched in the middle of the night and whisked off to be tortured in the basement of some Lithuanian disco. But, and this is important, Barack Obama is saying that won't happen to you as long as Barack Obama is President. Now it is clear what his message is to voters. He's saying 'Hey, you're safe with me. But I can't guarantee the next guy isn't going to disappear your son and hook his nipples up to a truck battery.' Or, as he used to say, 'hope.' But with the economy where it is, folks, he's going to have to go even further. I think next he should introduce, sign and then oppose a law granting him, the Commander-in-Chief, primae noctis, the right to deflower any man's wife on their wedding night. Now of course, President Obama would never do that. But President Gingrich? Do you really want to take that chance? Or to make sure he never has to leave office, Obama could simply sign the law allowing ex-Presidents to hunt Americans for sport. Up until now that was only legal for Vice Presidents.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey folks, how is this for an endorsement? Prostitutes at the world famous Bunny Ranch Brothel in Nevada have endorsed Ron Paul for President. And they said it was not an easy decision. They said it was hard to overlook Newt Gingrich's solid record of adultery. But still they had to go with Ron Paul.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, we're now finding out the real reason that former presidential candidate John Edwards wants to delay his trial. Heart problems. It began the day his mistress said, 'I'm five weeks late.' That's when he started getting palpitations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to 'The National Enquirer,' John Edwards has proposed to his mistress, Rielle Hunter. He gave three reasons for wanting to marry her. He loves her, she's the mother of his child, and of course, a wife can't testify against her husband.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Mexico has just completed construction of a bridge that is one of the world's highest. In fact, it clears the fence along our border by a good 50 feet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you been following the Republican nominee race? Fascinating. How about that Newt Gingrich? First of all it would be great fun and I believe this never happened before, to have a President named Newt. I mean, I could really get behind that. He had a horrible week in the Iowa caucuses. Listen to this, only 13% of his ex-wives voted for him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then of course Ron Paul, do you know about Ron Paul? Ron Paul looks like the kind of guy you keep overnight for observation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rick Perry decided he would stay in the race so there is still plenty of time not to vote for him. And he did so badly in Iowa and was so depressed, so Rick Perry went back to Texas and he was feeling bad and you know, he had not -- you know, you blame yourself for things like that. He decided that he needed something to cheer him up, put him back on his feet, so he executed a guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, here's some election news. The Republican candidates will have a debate tomorrow night at 9:00 p.m., and then wake up for another debate at 9:00 a.m. Sunday morning. Yeah. The candidates are expected to be tired and groggy, or as Rick Perry calls that, '100%.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is nice. Last night Joe Biden and his wife went to the movies to see 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.'

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a group calling itself the Courage Campaign is trying to win support for a millionaire tax by running an ad showing Kim Kardashian. They want the Kardashians to pay more. This is part of the plan to raise taxes on the dumbest 1%.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney. We're all excited about Mitt Romney. Over the weekend, he said that he enjoyed firing people. Yeah! Way to connect with the middle class there, Mitt. Turns out Mitt Romney is Mexican, did you know that? His entire family is from Mexico. Not only that, he was the Lone Ranger. Did you realize he was the Lone Ranger? Yup, and he was once married to Elizabeth Taylor. But mostly he's Mexican. That's all you need to know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then we have Ron Paul. Ron Paul who says that he has a big youth following. That the kids love him. They love the Ron Paul candidate. And I mean you can tell by looking at the guy he's a regular Justin Bieber. But he looks like everybody they interview after a UFO sighting, doesn't he?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ron Paul. And what about his wife? You ever see Ron Paul's wife? Does anybody ever see Ron Paul's wife, no, you never see his wife. And I'll tell you why.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Republican candidates going down to the wire in New Hampshire. ... During the debate on Saturday night, Jon Huntsman spoke Chinese, yeah. Not to be outdone during the debate, Newt Gingrich ate Chinese.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This crazy scandal, the Defense Department is trying to find out who leaked information to filmmakers making a movie about the killing of Osama bin Laden. Yeah. Even worse, the name of the movie is 'Harold and Kumar Kill Osama bin Laden.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people were talking about President Obama's controversial new plan for a leaner, cheaper US military. The plan calls for much fewer troops in countries like Iraq and Afghanistan, almost $1 trillion in budget cuts. They're really going to make the military very lean. To chop military spending, many of our soldiers are going to serve their active duty from home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's some election news. During yesterday's debate, Mitt Romney said he wasn't a career politician, and Newt Gingrich told him to drop the pious baloney.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This isn't good, you guys. The national debt has reached $15 trillion, the size of the entire US economy. I don't want to say President Obama's out of solutions for the debt, but today, he tried handing it off to Tim Tebow. 'Please, just do something. I can't -- you're the man.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, President Obama met with the Dallas Mavericks to congratulate them on their 2011 NBA championship, while Joe Biden met with the Globetrotters to congratulate them on that episode of 'Scooby-Doo' they did.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's begin with our continuing coverage of the Republicans' race for the White House. Tuesday is the New Hampshire primary. The crucial vote and a key bellwether for the South Carolina vote 12 days from then which you know is a -- zzzzzzzz.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The remaining Republican candidates gathered Saturday night on ABC television for a 9:00 p.m. debate and then inexplicably reassembled the next morning at 9:00 a.m. on NBC for another debate. It's like the Republican primaries become a telethon for electoral dystrophy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Your bologna has a first name and it's pious? That is a terrible name for bologna. Ma'am, can I have a sanctimonious cheese and pious bologna sandwich? Newt Gingrich calling someone out for pious bologna. That would be like Newt Gingrich waxing poetic on the sanctity of marriage. Now that is pious bologna. You know what? To be fair, Johnny Three Wives is right. We must protect marriage from gay people. It's not Adam and Steve. It's Adam and Eve and later Trish and eventually Barbara.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now this weekend just to grease the voting skids, the Republicans held not one, but two presidential debates. ... Now when I watch any debate obviously I play one of those drinking games. But I knew there were two debates this weekend so to take it easy, I took a shot only when someone said the word 'contraception.' By the end I was more wasted than a donation to the Huntsman campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Needless to say, I was a little hung-over. I woke up the next day thinking, 'Jesus, whose opinions did I agree with last night?' But nothing cures a debate hangover like a little hair of the elephant that bit you. Luckily NBC had a debate the next morning at 9 a.m., a great chance to see how Mitt Romney's positions had changed over the past ten hours.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Listen I grew up in Britain, had my fill of the whole division between social classes thing. I didn't watch 'Downton Abbey' over the weekend.

Mitt Romney says he knows it's not easy keeping a roof over your family's heads as well as vacation roofs in San Diego, New Hampshire, and Park City, Utah. All those roofs add up.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Iran, what are you doing? Why are you poking at us? You know what, Iran? Meet me at camera three. What's up, Iran? I know it's fun to annoy us, pull on the Great Satan's beard. You do realize there are a lot of people in this country who would like to bomb you. Have you paid attention to your region's history in the past ten years or so? Do you want us to bomb you? Did you look at Iraq and think, 'How do we get in on that some of that action? We have far too many working roads and erect buildings. I hear there's money to be made in the rubble business.' Look, I don't know if you know this but ever since our manufacturing base departed in the 70s, bombing [bleep] in the desert is kind of our thing now. You know in the United States our chief export is 'booms!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only guy who won't bomb you is Ron Paul and believe they me they are going to do everything they can not to let that guy win. Iran if you keep this up, I wouldn't be surprised if Obama has to bomb you himself to keep these other guys from calling him chicken [bleep]. Americans don't hate you and I hope Iranians don't hate us but if you really want a war, [bleep] with America during election season. Get in between seven powerful men who have a chance to have an office with no corners and the power to 24 hours a day pick up the phone and order any [bleep] sandwich they want. There isn't any one of these guys who wouldn't bomb you to get a turkey club at four in the morning.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The New Hampshire primary is finally here. Now, I don't know who won. Normally I broadcast live at 11:30, but once again I am taping my show at 7:00, sacrificing reporting the results of the all-important New Hampshire primary so I can get an early start preparing for the even more important South Carolina primary, which most experts agree is extremely next. It is just two weeks away, which means I have to get home to put my pig in the smoker tonight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The winner of Dixville Notch has gone on to be the Republican nominee in every election since 1960, which must mean that the 2012 Republican nominee will be Mitt Romney and Jon Huntsman stitched together in a human 'centi-GOP-ede.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, all the money's on Romney. In fact, Romney's only got one tiny vulnerability, the years he spent as a heartless corporate raider at Bain Capital extracting millions from troubled companies by taking them over, firing their workforce and then chopping them up to sell the pieces to the highest bidder with no regard for the lives destroyed. But that's all the past. Mitt will breeze to the White House as long as he never reminds voters what Bain Capital did. ... Romney really stuck his foot in his mouth with this one, which is the spiciest thing he's eaten in years. And, of course, of course the media and the other candidates have jumped on Mitt like Newt Gingrich on a younger, healthier wife.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;In New Hampshire, the Republican primary election took place. New Hampshire voters gathered to decide which middle-aged white guy looked best in a pair of pleated Dockers. As expected, Mitt Romney won it with 38% of the vote. Ron Paul finished second, with 23%, Jon Huntsman in third, with 17%. Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum I believe each got around 10% and Rick Perry, just got the finger, I think. The New Hampshire primary is a tough one for the candidates who don't do well because this is the night when many of them realize, 'I served all those people pancakes for nothing.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;It seems like every month, we've had a new Republican front-runner, which is interesting because I don't go back and forth, as far as who I support. I make my choice for President, based on how well each candidate would handle an alien invasion. Figure out if a candidate would be a President like the one in 'Independence Day' who gives an awesome speech, and saddles up. Or one like 'Superman II,' who kneels before Zod and screams for Superman. I feel like Romney would be a kneeler and a screamer. But he is at the top of the pack. I came up with a great campaign slogan for Mitt Romney today. 'It's Time to Mitt or Get Off the Pot.' It works, right? He can use that, by the way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Newt Gingrich thinks he's the man for the job. He got an important endorsement from Sarah Palin's husband, Todd. He has the all-important snowmobilers who wear sunglasses indoors demographic. Todd Palin said he's supporting Newt Gingrich because he believes Newt is the candidate who looks most like a snowman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Rick Santorum didn't have a strong showing tonight. But he has come up with a creative way to raise campaign money. Between now and January 11th, and this is real. This is not something we made up. Everybody that donates $100 or more to the Santorum campaign will receive an official Rick Santorum for President sweater vest. ... The website says the sweater vest is, quote, 'Perfect for demonstrating solidarity with true conservatives.' And, quote, 'A great way to show support for Rick.' And also, a great way to encourage bullies to beat you up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney had a huge lead going into the primary. It would've taken a miraculous, divinely-inspired comeback for anyone to defeat him. So let me be the first to say congratulations, President Tim Tebow.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, congratulations to Mitt Romney. He won the New Hampshire primary last night. And it's really inspirational. See, this is proof that even the multimillionaire son of a multimillionaire can beat the odds and run for President of the United States.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not a good showing for Governor Rick Perry. Rick Perry came in dead last with 1% of the vote. You know, it's not good when he can't even beat low fat milk, okay? But Rick Perry was philosophical about it. He said, 'Last week was Iowa. Yesterday was New Hampshire. Tomorrow is South Carolina.' He said at least it's giving him a chance to learn the name of all the states.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you watch Saturday's Republican debate? Jon Huntsman spoke Chinese. See, he wanted to appeal to our manufacturing base.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the tabloids, John Edwards is going to marry his mistress, Rielle Hunter. Which means, of course, now he has to find a new mistress, and the whole thing starts again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ladies and gentlemen a shout out to our own network earlier the network hosted the People's Choice Awards. You know who won? Ron Paul was the big winner at the People's Choice Award. Yeah. Very special category. He won for Best Geezer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney getting up a head of steam wins in New Hampshire. If we were going to vote for a new President and you were going to vote for a Republican President and the polls were open today, would you vote for Mitt Romney? Please, ladies and gentlemen stay seated, I'm telling you, you don't want anybody hurt. Don't stampede the stage. Mitt-mania. They have to release some sort of sleeping gas. Yeah, Mitt. I'm having trouble warming up to Mitt he looks like the guy in the restaurant that comes to your table to make sure everything's all right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Mitt won last night and went crazy. You don't think of Mitt going crazy but he went crazy and insiders tell me when they announced and the polls closed and he was the big winner, list, he busted open a can of caffeine-free Diet Coke.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only surprise in last night's New Hampshire primary is how well Ron Paul did. He gave a speech afterwards. In Ron Paul's speech last night, did you see this; he described himself to the crowd as 'dangerous.' Yeah, then one of his handlers fed him some warm milk through an eye dropper and he fell asleep in a shoebox. They carried him out very gently.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night Mitt Romney won the New Hampshire primary with 39% of the vote. He said the voters of New Hampshire have spoken loud and clear, and said, 'Well, this is all we've got. Might as well fill it in.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After Iowa and New Hampshire, Mitt Romney's campaign is now 2 for 2. After his performance last night, Rick Perry's campaign's merchandise is now 2 for 1. So, you can get a foam finger, key chain, and I forget -- I forget the third one, oops.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We'll begin tonight with results of last night's voting in New Hampshire in 'Indecision 2012.' With 100% of the votes counted, the man of the night, one Millard Mittington Romney, who captured New Hampshire with 39% of the vote. It was an historic win for Romney. He became the first Republican non-incumbent to win Iowa and New Hampshire while still having no one like him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[As Mitt Romney] &quot;'See, people, my promises are realistic. A tiny government, a balanced budget and a giant invincible army. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you New Sparta.' It's like old Sparta, very similar. It's like old Sparta but with less capital gains taxes and not as gay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since we brought up Jon Huntsman, seeing as I believe the opportunity to do so is a limited-time offer. New Hampshire was Huntsman's big gamble. He skipped Iowa to concentrate all his efforts on winning there. He&quot; campaigned there &quot;for a year. And finished a distant third. That's gotta sting. ... : Oh, right, he speaks Mandarin. I can't believe that's not impressive to a Republican primary audience who won't even eat mandarin oranges, because they don't want to take jobs away from American fruit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now that Romney has won a non-binding caucus by eight votes and a plurality of the vote in one of the smallest primaries in the nation, he is a juggernaut. You know what, folks; I'm starting to see it: President Romney. It could work. Sure, he's not the warmest candidate or the most conservative, but, you know, he's there. And let's be honest, I've seen this coming for a long time. It's not fireworks, but, you know, I should just grow up and accept it. It's like an arranged marriage. I should think of myself not as a voter, but as a 12-year-old Indonesian girl promised to the rich old man from a nearby village.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My home state of South Carolina is where presidents are chosen and occasionally seceded from. But, I mean, really who is the option? Everyone in the Republican field has already had their 'I'm not Mitt' moment. I just wish there was some fresh face, untainted by the process that could just swoop in and save the day. ... Oh, my God! It's me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;In less-interesting news, the New Hampshire primary was held yesterday. This year, they had it in New Hampshire. And as expected, Mitt Romney won easily. This race, I'll tell you, is heating up with the intensity of an EZ-Bake Oven. A poor performance in New Hampshire typically results in some of the candidates dropping out of the race. But so far, it looks like everyone who competed yesterday is staying in. It's like if one of the women on 'The Bachelor' didn't get a rose but said, 'I'm staying in the mansion.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;And Fidel Castro is weighing in on our choice for President. He posted a blog entry this week, titled 'The Best President for the United States.' Castro said he thinks a robot would do a better job than President Obama. And if Mitt Romney wins, that could happen. He went on to say that, if faced with the choice of Obama, any of the Republican candidates, or a robot, 90% of Americans would vote for the robot. Sounds like somebody's finally getting repeats of 'Small Wonder' down in Havana. With all due respect, Mr. Castro, we tried the robot thing here in California. And it didn't work out. Some people got pregnant, suffice it to say.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Ron Paul finished second in New Hampshire. He had 23% of the vote. Paul's campaign says if he can sustain those kinds of numbers in the next few primaries and if his message continues to resonate with Independent voters and if mitt Romney gets hit by a dump truck, he could win this thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Now, the candidates will head to South Carolina. A little-known fact that it used to be one Carolina. Until Mitt Romney's company bought it and split it into two.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a great day for Mitt Romney; last night he won the New Hampshire primary. Congratulations, establishment cyborg. People are being inspired by his bland diction and gorgeous hair. Now Romney's win in New Hampshire means that he received seven delegates and a wagon full of maple syrup. Then he goes to South Carolina where the winner gets a hog and a gamecock. ... He looks like a decent guy. Of course he's a corporate vampire who bought companies to suck profits out of them but he made an ass-load of money doing it and now owns four houses so it worked out in the end. All of his opponents are going after him for being the head of a venture capital firm. Republicans attacking a guy for making money in the free market? That's like Clinton criticizing an internship program. That's crazy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The thing I don't like about Romney, he's not funny. For a while, the field was looking promising for late night comedians. Herman Cain, the pizza guy who likes to give women extra sausage. Then Michele Bachmann, with the crazy eyes and the gay husband who knows how to cure gay people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The problem with Mitt Romney, everybody thinks he's a flip-flopper. What they mean is he's not someone who brings a fixed ideology into a situation. They're accusing him of weighing the facts before making a decision and being willing to change his mind if the facts warrant it. Do we want this country run by an informed decision maker? No, we want someone who hears everything and says, 'I don't care. I'm right.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But there's the dark horse. Rick Santorum. Former senator of Pennsylvania. Very, very anti-gay. Do we have a picture of him? There you are. Let me see that again? Nothing says straight dude like flexing in a sweater vest.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The other day at a campaign event, Mitt Romney told the crowd that he is half Mexican. Which means that half of him will not be voting for Mitt Romney.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you know this, since 2010, Homeland Security has been monitoring YouTube. Which explains number four on the FBI's most wanted list is 'Panda on a Trampoline.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama met with Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie in the Oval Office yesterday. And after they left, Obama checked the White House to make sure Sasha and Malia were still there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's right. Brad and Angelina went to the White House. When they discussed adoption, Obama was like, 'Can I interest you in a Biden?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's an election update. Political experts are saying that Mitt Romney's lack of support in the Latino community could cost him the presidency.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see this? A new tell-all book about Mitt Romney is coming out next week. It's called 'The Real Romney.' You can tell the book is based on Romney. After the 300 pages, the last line is, 'Actually, I just changed my mind about all that.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The State Department issued a new travel warning yesterday, urging citizens to avoid Syria. Yeah. It's part of the new set of warnings called, 'Things You Were Probably Doing Already.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But before we get to that we want to begin with the Republican primary race and the tale of one Newton Leroy Gingrich, who just last month had read the electoral tea leaves and was ready to call the primary for one Newton Leroy Gingrich. ... You have to think about the polls. They are unfortunately followed by the voting. The two don't really match up exactly. Say hello to the new President of Fourthlandia, Newt Gingrich.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes, I am officially beating Jon Huntsman in South Carolina. Proving what I have always said, if voters want a different version of Mitt Romney, they can always just wait a few days and it will be Mitt Romney. Now clearly my fellow 'South Caroliniacs' see me as the only viable Mitt-ternative.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Apparently, the government is reading our Facebook pages. Did you know this? There's a report from the Department of Homeland Security. It says they regularly monitor social networking sites, like Facebook, Twitter and MySpace. So that's who is looking at MySpace, I guess. Apparently, they're on there looking for terrorists. And funny pictures of cats. And not only do they monitor the social networking sites. The report says Homeland Security also keeps an eye on YouTube and Hulu. Youtube, I get. But why do they need to monitor Hulu? Are there terrorists on 'Parks and Rec' that we don't know about?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, of course the big rap that has got everybody talking about Mitt Romney is that when he travels he straps his dog to the roof of the car. Did you know about that? And now Newt Gingrich is on the attack. And he's saying 'Yeah, well, I used to do that with my first wife.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So right now what Mitt is doing, he's looking for a running mate and boy, talk about strong suit for the Republicans. Dick Cheney? Dan Quayle? Sarah Palin? Spirew Agnew?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, you know who is no longer in the race, I'm kind of going to miss him, is Jon Huntsman. He's the ... there were two Mormon candidates, Mitt Romney and Jon Huntsman. Jon Huntsman is the Mormon who believes a dog should ride inside a car. He's gone. He's out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top Ten Things People Said When They Heard That Jon Huntsman Was Dropping Out Of The Race:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. Who's Jon Huntsman?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Is he the rich boring white guy, or the other rich boring white guy?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Seriously, who's Jon Huntsman?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. You mean my tax attorney? Oh wait, that's Stan Huntsman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Does this mean we can bring Herman Cain back? That guy was hilarious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. So, that leaves only four viable candidates, plus Rick Perry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. It's like Jon Huntsman said ... Well, actually, I have no idea what he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Hey honey, some guy I've never heard of is dropping out of the race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. He should have Tebowed more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Now who's gonna lose to Obama in the general election?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Interesting little fact for you. According to a study today the third Monday in January is the most depressing day of the year. Yeah, especially if you're a Broncos fan who supports Jon Huntsman. That's just a double whammy, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some big election news. Jon Huntsman has officially dropped out of the 2012 presidential race. Wow, not having Jon Huntsman on the campaign trail is gonna be like -- well, it's gonna be like having Jon Huntsman on the campaign trail. There's really no effect, really.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you guys see this? During a campaign event on Saturday, Mitt Romney reached into his pocket and gave cash to a woman who said she was broke. Which got awkward, when she was like, 'I'm also lonely.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You're probably wondering why I'm wearing a bejeweled crown. Long story short. I came into a little bit of money on Thursday. ... I'm now running Colbert's super PAC and the vast fortune that that entails but here's the problem. I don't know what to do with the money, and Stephen Colbert by law cannot coordinate with me. ... Because of the strict separation of super PAC and candidate and the fact that I don't speak to Stephen Colbert except by phone or in person, I'm just out here like a cartoon hobo who won the lottery. Do I use all this money that individuals and/or corporations who believe deeply in Stephen Colbert have donated to create an advertising campaign around Colbert's strengths or do I buy this from the estate of Elizabeth Taylor? Both are legal. Both are legal. But only one brings out my eyes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You see, on Thursday in response to leading Jon Huntsman, 5% to 4% in a major poll, I announced the formation of an exploratory committee for a possible run for the President of the United States of South Carolina. ... Folks, do you see what has happened here? The mere possibility that I might run for President blew Jon Huntsman all the way back to the Land's End catalog he came from.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Again, that's just from me exploring the idea of running. Can you imagine what it would do to the field if I, Stephen Colbert, looked into the camera right now and officially announced -- but I'm not. By the way, that snapping sound you heard just now was the sphincters of the other candidates slamming shut. You have to listen. You have to listen closely for Romney because it starts out about 90% clenched.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, President Obama will be going to Disney World where he'll unveil his new plan to create jobs. And what better place for the President to talk about his jobs plan than Fantasy Land? Then later we'll talk about reducing the budget in Tomorrow Land.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the other night on Fox News, Senator John McCain told Sean Hannity that choosing Sarah Palin was 'still the best decision I ever made.' Well, today the Arizona DMV took away his driver's license. Dementia. Yeah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday Jon Huntsman withdrew from the Republican presidential race. Can you believe that? Huntsman was still in the race? Did you know he was in the race? Well, Huntsman has endorsed Mitt Romney because he believes Romney has the best chance to win. Is he the best judge? I mean, up until yesterday he thought he had the best chance to win. Okay, so, I don't know if I can put any truth to that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney, whose father was born in Mexico, is now talking up his Mexican heritage to try and attract the Hispanic vote. But, not to be out done Newt Gingrich said he once cheated on one of his wives with a woman named Juanita. So, I guess they're all trying to get that Hispanic connection.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, and Newt Gingrich has released a new ad attacking Mitt Romney because he knows how to speak French. Well, Mitt Romney is not the only one. He speaks French. Jon Huntsman speaks Chinese. Rick Perry of course speaks gibberish.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and last night in the South Carolina debate Rick Santorum attacked Mitt Romney for supporting voting rights for felons. Why shouldn't we let felons vote? Huh? We vote for them. Why not let them vote? I mean, they run for office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a cardiologist now says that former Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards' trial has to be delayed because Edwards has a life threatening condition. Huh. Hey, don't all husbands who cheat have a life threatening condition? ... He's going to have surgery in February. But the good news is while he's under they're going to also try to neuter him. So I think that is good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is kind of interesting. PBS is coming out with a four-hour documentary on Bill Clinton that will focus on Clinton's marital infidelities. It's four hours. The documentary will cover the period from June 1997 to July 1997.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because of a protest, starting at midnight, Wikipedia is going to shut down for 24 hours. Yeah, in fact, it's 11:05 right now. So you have less than one hour to get most of your facts wrong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today's First Lady Michelle Obama's 48th birthday. Yeah, President Obama wanted to surprise her. But he couldn't find a male stripper willing to jump out of a sensible garden salad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At last night's Republican debate, Mitt Romney talked about his love of hunting. Yeah. In fact, Romney said on his last hunting trip, he shot three deer and fired two elk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is visiting Disney World on Thursday to promote a new plan to boost tourism. Of course, it's going to be awkward when he walks through the Hall of Presidents and sees they're making room for Mitt Romney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama doesn't pay admission to Disney World. He just charges it to the China section of Epcot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All right, as you know, yesterday was the Martin Luther King, Jr., celebration and the 16th Republican debate. Two events with what I can only imagine has a very small crossover audience.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now I know a lot of you didn't have time to watch the whole debate and may not have time to watch our nine minutes of talking about it so for viewers in a hurry here's a synopsis of the debate. ... They were all over each other. In fact, the general theme of the evening was 'Everybody On This Stage Tonight Is An [Bleep]hole Except For Me.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Romney and Gingrich are pulling ahead of Rick Perry in his home state. It is official: You can mess with Texas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, the South Carolina GOP primary campaign is in full swing. Candidates are shaking hands, kissing babies, and strategically ignoring Confederate flags.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night the candidates squared off in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, which means the 2012 Republican debates have now officially passed 'The Simpsons' for the most episodes in TV history.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Jon Huntsman has dropped out of the presidential race and has endorsed Mitt Romney. So, the Republicans now have a clear choice between the rich white guy, the dumb white guy, the homophobic white guy or the really angry white guy. So pick the one you want.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, a reporter asked Rick Perry if he planned on dropping out. Perry said, 'No, I already did that in high school.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney coming under fire. Even though he is a multi multimillionaire, he only paid 15% in taxes; 15%, that's not a tax, that's barely a tip.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to a 'Washington Post' poll, 84% of Americans do not approve of the way Congress is doing its job; 16% weren't even aware Congress is doing a job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is pretty incredible. Over $400,000 in pocket change was left behind by passengers at TSA security checkpoints. $400,000, isn't that amazing? See, I always leave money when I'm there, but I do it on purpose. I mean, after the way that guy touches me, I feel like I've got to tip him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But there's some bad news for Mitt Romney today. Standard &amp; Poor's downgraded him from bland to boring.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know why this hasn't gotten a bigger deal. When Mitt travels, he travels a lot as a politician, and whatever else he did. He would always travel. And they would take the dog, a family dog, and you know when you're traveling, room is really at a premium in the car. So they would put the dog on the roof of the car. And they'd load it all up, and the dog would be strapped to the roof of the car and he'd drive around and people would say, 'You can't be doing that.' And Newt Gingrich said, 'Yeah, I did that once with an ex-wife.' So, you know, to me any guy who is tying his animal to the roof of the car, and then he hops on I-95 doing 80, well, I don't want that guy running for President. Do you, really? Forget the car seat, 'Hey kids!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Newt Gingrich said almost one-third of his income goes to paying taxes. Yeah, then he said another third goes to ordering seconds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the big story today is a lot of websites, including Wikipedia and Craigslist, decided to shut themselves down in order to protest the anti-piracy bill SOPA. Craigslist users were like, 'Great, now where am I going to find a couch, a job and a hooker all in one place?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night President Obama took Michelle out to a steak restaurant for her birthday, marking it the first time in months the word 'Obama' and 'well-done' appeared in the same sentence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During a Republican debate this week, Mitt Romney said he's been elk hunting but he's not, quote, 'a serious hunter.' Although, you know who does consider Romney a serious hunter? The elk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My guest, conservative columnist David Frum says the GOP has lost its way. No surprise. Old men hate asking directions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With just three days left until the big vote, all eyes are on South Carolina. And so far only Newt Gingrich has a head big enough to block everyone's view.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People actually pay to hear Mitt Romney speak. But as he says, they don't pay him very much, just $374,000 last year. Think about it, folks. If that was his entire salary, Mitt's income level would drop all the way down to the top 1%.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's an amazing survival story with a happy ending. A hiker who was lost in a blizzard on Washington State's Mt. Rainer said he stayed alive by digging a snow tunnel and burning dollar bills for warmth. He had a bunch of five dollar bills and one dollar bills in his wallet, and burned them all to stay warm. Burned them all. The good news, today he was offered a job as President Obama's economic adviser.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, President Obama was in Disney World today where he unveiled his new plan to create jobs. He was joined by Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse but not Goofy. He had to stay behind to tend to his vice presidential duties.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know why President Obama chose Disney World? It was the only place with longer lines than the unemployment office, so it looks better.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Mitt Romney said today when he visits Disney World, he will lay off Tinker Bell and downsize the Seven Dwarfs to four. 'Lay off four dwarfs. I like firing dwarfs!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's a shocker. Rick Perry has dropped out of the presidential race. Apparently, America did not want a conservative, gun happy, intellectually challenged Governor of Texas for President. At least not again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, Jon Huntsman dropped out of the presidential race as well. But he endorsed fellow Mormon Mitt Romney, which is a huge relief to the Mormon community that they've united again. 'Cause, between Huntsman and Romney, Mormons haven't been this divided, I guess since Marie was a little bit country and Donny was a little bit rock 'n' roll.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the debates the other night, Mitt Romney said he is not an avid hunter, but he is happy to go along if someone invites him to go hunting. Which Newt Gingrich said, 'Hey, maybe you can tag along with Dick Cheney.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, tonight there was a CNN primary debate with the four remaining candidates. It was kind of a change for Newt Gingrich. You know, usually when he's arguing with three people at once, it's his wife, his ex-wife and his mistress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now here's something about politics. It's the conflict and the confusion is both befuddling and entertaining. You know what happened now, they did a recount in Iowa. ... And everybody thought that Mitt Romney was the big Iowa caucus winner. No, he didn't win. It turns out after the recount Rick Santorum won the Iowa caucuses. You folks know what this means? Neither do I. I have no idea. ... Good for Rick Santorum. What, he's like President of Iowa now? Good for him. Who cares?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Newt Gingrich is the guy who has been married six, seven times. And now his ex-wife is giving an interview talking all about Newt and apparently she's bitter and angry. One of the ex-wives. I don't know, is it number two? Have they gotten to Roman numerals yet on his ex-wives? And Newt is defensive. He's saying 'Oh, she's just angry because when we traveled I would strap her to the roof of the car and-'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know whose wife you never see is Ron Paul, the guy that looks like the prospector. Every time you see him you're just waiting for him to say 'Dag nabbit, a mule stepped on my foot, dag nabbit.' You never see his wife because she's of course busy at the fish stick factory.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top Ten Revelations In The Interview With Newt Gingrich's Ex-Wife:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. He keeps getting married just for the cake</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Their towels were monogrammed 'His' and 'Current Wife's'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Newt has a revolving account at Dairy Queen</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. He never leaves home without a set of blank divorce papers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. He was born in Kenya</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. In college he broke into a primate testing facility and was scratched by an infectious rhesus monkey</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Like a boa constrictor, he squeezes his food to death and swallows it whole</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Newt was once briefly married to Kris Humphries</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. His body is featured in Jenny Craig 'Before' photos</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Once had sex with a vending machine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rick Perry dropped out of the presidential race. He's out. Yeah, when asked what went wrong, Perry said, 'I guess America still isn't ready to elect a dumb guy from Texas. But in time...'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Newt Gingrich is in the news. Newt Gingrich's second wife said Newt wanted to have an open marriage. I think it might be true because at the last debate, Newt turned off the lights and said, 'Hey, fellows, let's just all be President.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Texas Governor Rick Perry officially dropped out of the race for President. Yeah. He just couldn't get over that one campaign hurdle -- you know, talking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see this today? President Obama aired his first campaign ad of 2012 which promotes his record on clean energy. Obama's a big environmentalist. In fact, for the election, he plans to recycle the same promises he made four years ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of President Obama, next week, President Obama will visit Iowa, Arizona, Las Vegas, Denver and Detroit. Not because he's campaigning, just 'cause all he could afford was a Southwest flight with a bunch of layovers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday on CNN, Newt Gingrich said if he's elected President, he plans to offer Sarah Palin a very big role in the White House. Not only that, Gingrich said also he plans to eat a very big roll in the White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rick Perry's endorsement of Newt Gingrich gave the former Speaker a three minute respite from the news that Gingrich's ex-wife was about to go divorce court on his ass. Three minutes, Gingrich barely had time to have a victory affair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As disturbing as the open marriage revelation is, the open marriage revelation is in keeping with Newt's philosophy, he's a free market man, free of onerous regulation. He's just encouraging competition, creative destruction, procreative destruction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;In South Carolina, yet another debate between the Republican candidates for President. One more and they'll have enough episodes to go into syndication.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Newt Gingrich had a rough night tonight. One of his two ex-wives, Marianne Gingrich, sat down for an interview on 'Nightline' tonight. She thinks Newt lacks the moral integrity to be President. Gingrich, if you don't know, was caught cheating on Marianne, with the woman who is now his third wife, while he was leading impeachment proceedings against Bill Clinton for the Monica Lewinsky stuff. In other words, he puts the 'hippo' in hypocrite.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Texas Governor, Rick Perry, dropped out of the race this morning. He left the same way he entered it. Confused and possibly a little bit drunk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;In his concession speech today, Perry endorsed Newt Gingrich. He said he decided to endorse Newt Gingrich after he found out that his first choice, GI Joe, was not a real person. I'm not sure how far an endorsement from Rick Perry goes nowadays. You'd be better off with an endorsement from Katy Perry. I am going to miss Rick Perry, especially during the debates. When anyone asked him a question, he looked like he was trying to figure out the plot to 'Inception.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here is a very exciting scientific story. Scientists announced today they have detected a brand new subatomic particle. This particle is so tiny it is actually smaller than the income tax rate paid by Mitt Romney.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I always like how these guys try to show they're just regular folks. Like in the debate last night, Mitt Romney said he has not lived in Washington. He's lived in the real streets of America. Rodeo Drive, 5th Avenue, Park Avenue. Where the real people are. But on the other hand, turns out Newt Gingrich wrote off two of his marriages as a total loss. He just wrote those off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, anybody watch the debates? Newt was pretty good. I got to admit. He lashed out. He said the attacks from the media make it harder to attract decent people to run for office. And he's right. That's why people like Newt Gingrich run for office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Rick Perry pulled out of the presidential race yesterday. Which is bad news for the guys on death row in Texas. He's coming home and he's not in a good mood.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Obama was in Disney World yesterday. And someone asked him if he wanted to take a picture with Grumpy, and Obama said, 'Ron Paul's here?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, there's a mini scandal going on in Disney World in Florida right now. Seems that when Newt Gingrich was down there, he was seeing both Snow White and Cinderella at the same time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're getting ready now for President Barack Obama's campaign and State of the Union Address coming up pretty soon. And he wants to remind Americans, and this is pretty impressive when you start listing things Barack Obama has taken care of. Bin Laden, adios. Bin Laden. Gadhafi. Gadhafi, bye-bye, no more, thank you. Regis is gone. So that's something. Oh! We almost got Robert Wagner, but no.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Barack Obama was down there addressing some dignitaries at Disney World. Big day for Disney World. They even put the pants on Donald Duck.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Huge news, in politics over the weekend, Mitt Romney lost in South Carolina. That's a huge story. Yeah. So he's going to get desperate. Now he's getting intense, with the Florida primaries coming up today, Mitt Romney's campaign staff said the gloves are off.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tomorrow, Mitt Romney is going to release his 2010 and 2011 tax returns. Not to be outdone, tomorrow, Newt Gingrich, is going to release his 1998, 1994 and 2005 wedding vows.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But first let's get to the primary. Newt Gingrich crushed Mitt Romney on Saturday. After disappointing showings in Iowa and New Hampshire, Newt's campaign looked terminally ill, which is generally when he moves on to something better.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama gave his State of the Union, and he said the state of the union is strong. Yeah. Meanwhile, Newt Gingrich made a speech to his wife and said, 'The state of our union is open.' He was wearing a silk robe when he said it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yet another Republican debate last night. Because we do need more of those.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republicans held their 18th debate last night. The question on everyone's mind -- Who cares? It was a dud. Total dud. Candidates did not even attack each other thanks to 'Saturday Night Live' host and part-time news anchor Brian Williams. Way to go, Admiral Fun Stop.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Tonight, President Obama focused on four areas he believes are the keys to restoring economic security. Energy, manufacturing, education, and TV shows about cupcakes, which we love.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Yesterday, Mitt Romney, who is hoping to run against President Obama, released his tax returns from the last two years. And what we suspected all along has finally been confirmed. He's rich. Romney and his wife earned more than $42 million in the last two years. And only paid about 15% in taxes. In fairness, he has a lot of expenses. His Just for Sideburns budget alone is $300,000 a year.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new website just came out. It's been designed to calculate how long it takes Mitt Romney to earn your salary. Yeah, a website that calculates that.

What's interesting is in the time it took you to think about that joke, Mitt Romney made $65 million.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, lately obviously we've heard about the candidates running to be the Republican nominee for President, but were you aware we already have a President? Last night, the current President strode to the podium to deliver a message to the citizens of this great nation. And obviously for a speech like this, joint session, you want to ease in. You want to warm up the crowd gradually. ... He didn't open the State of the Union with an Al Green song. He should have, though. ... You open with 'I killed bin Laden?' You open with that? 'Hey everybody, how you doing? You having a nice night? I [bleep] killed bin Laden! I killed him!' What are you doing? Does Rick Springfield open with 'Jesse's Girl?' No! He opens with 'I've Done Everything for You' and transitions to 'Don't Talk to Strangers,' slows it down with 'Affair of the Heart' and then hits you with something off the new album and just when you think it can't get any more [bleep] beautiful 'Jesse's Girl!'

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is traveling the country. Did you know this? He spent last night in Las Vegas? This morning he woke up on his hotel room floor trying to figure out what to do about a tiger, a baby and 9% unemployment.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to new polls that just came out, Mitt Romney does very well with Republican voters who make more than $200,000. Yeah. Or as Romney calls them, 'trailer trash.' 'Can someone live on that? How do you do it? They must be garbage!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, big Republican debate tonight in Florida. It is the 19th of the season. One more and they win a free debate. There are only five days left right now until the Florida primary. Romney and Gingrich are neck and neck. Well, neck and amphibian display pouch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not going to lie to you folks, Mitt is in trouble. A recent poll said 61% of people said Mitt Romney will say anything he has to to get elected and to woo that 61% Mitt Romney immediately agreed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But folks, Mitt Romney recently proved that his principles are as unwavering as his hair. He has repeatedly said that corporations are people but he has never said good people or bad people. Until yesterday when he stood up for the most maligned corporate people of all, banks. ... Yes, the banks are feeling the same thing that you're feeling. When they look at your house, they also think, 'That belongs to me.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And let's not forget that Florida has more foreclosures than any other state. So with pro-bank statements like that, Mitt is not going to win any popularity contests. But Mitt is not out to win a popularity contest, he's out to win an election. How do those work? Oh he's up [bleep] Creek!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;There was another Republican debate in Florida tonight. Can't we cancel this show already? It was the 47th of 265 debates that are scheduled to happen between now and when Jesus returns. What is left to know about these candidates? Is someone going to confess to a murder? Fortunately, tonight's debate was the last one we're going to see for three and a half weeks. The candidates are going to take a break, to spend more time at home attacking the moral integrity of their families.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Yesterday, Newt Gingrich, yesterday, made an interesting promise during a campaign stop in the city of Cocoa, Florida. I think it's funny, a guy looks like a marshmallow would stop in Cocoa. While in Cocoa, floating around deliciously, Gingrich said, 'By the end of my second term as President, we will have the first permanent base on the moon.' This guy really wants to get away from those wives of his, doesn't he?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, congratulations to SEAL Team Six. You know the guys who got Osama bin Laden? Well, they did it again. They staged a successful rescue of two hostages being held in Somalia. Let me tell you something, these guys could take out anybody. In fact today, Mitt Romney called and said, 'Are you available for freelance work in the Florida area?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Newt Gingrich has been attacking Mitt Romney for being wealthy and having money in bank accounts in the Cayman Islands. See, that's when you know you're part of the top 1%, when your bank's address has the word island in it, okay? Any time your bank is on an island, you got a lot of money. But, Mitt Romney says he is not a creature of Washington. He has lived in the real streets of America. I believe it's Easy Street, if I'm not mistaken.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now Senator John McCain has gotten into the act. McCain says the Republican debates have turned into mud wrestling, to which Herman Cain said, 'I knew I got out too soon.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend Herman Cain announced he's endorsing Newt Gingrich. Well, sure. Adulterers like to stick together, you know. You never know when you need an alibi. 'Yeah, you cover for me. I'll cover for you.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, earlier this month Rick Perry also announced he is endorsing Newt. Are those the kind of endorsements Newt Gingrich wants? I mean, a philanderer and a guy who can't spell philanderer? Is that really the strongest endorsement?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ron Paul, he was not in Florida. He was campaigning up in Maine. They think he was afraid that if he went to Florida, they'd grab him and put him in an old folks home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, happy birthday to former Vice President Dick Cheney. He turns -- he's only 71? I thought he was like 104. He's only 71? I don't know what kind of party they had for him, but after five heart attacks, I'm guessing not a surprise party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy birthday to former Vice President of the United States Dick 'Boom Boom' Cheney. Happy birthday, Dick. ... They had a nice party for Dick Cheney. Only three people were wounded when he shot out the candles.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Newt wants to colonize the moon. He says that what we need to do -- and he may be on to something here. He is says if he's elected President he will start building a colony on the moon. And I said, 'Well hell, if Newt Gingrich is President I'm going to the colony on the moon!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see the pictures of Mitt Romney doing his laundry, did you see that? He's down there the laundry mat he's pouring in the softener and stuff. You know, he looks like the guy in your building that goes down there, takes your laundry out of the machine, puts his in. ... Yeah, Mitt Romney was doing his own laundry. He was down there doing his laundry. Trying to get the cognac stains out of his smoking jacket.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They say that Mitt Romney now is outspending Newt Gingrich 5-1. ... But of course Newt is out marrying Mitt 3-1.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Snoop Dogg endorsed Ron Paul for President. Snoop Dogg endorsed Ron Paul for President. Snoop said he likes Paul's positions on everything from legalizing pot to legalizing pot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's interesting; a newspaper says studies show that Republican candidates are buying a lot of ad time on the Weather Channel. Whenever the forecast calls for rain, they pay the weatherman to say, 'Thanks a lot, Obama.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The members of the Tea Party in Tennessee want to remove all mention of slavery from school textbooks. Yeah, instead, they would like textbooks to say that Abraham Lincoln freed the unpaid interns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a new round of campaign ads, Republican candidates have accused Mitt Romney of being too far to the left. Which explains why today, Romney received an endorsement from the Baltimore Ravens kicker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[On Gingrich's moon colony idea] &quot;'By the end of my third term, I will have shaved the sides off Michigan so it looks like it's flipping off aliens. By my fifth term, I will have fed the nation's poor with the cheap food stuff made from their own children. By my seventh term I will have trained cats to do jobs that immigrants do.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tomorrow is the deadline for all Super PACs to at last file their financial-disclosure reports with the Federal Election Commission. Up until now we didn't know who was funding these Super PACs. The great day for transparency because tomorrow voters in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Florida will finally have the vital information that would have been useful before they voted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Tomorrow in Florida, the Republican primary election. Most polls have Mitt Romney leading Newt Gingrich by at least 12 points but Newt says he will stay in the race till the convention no matter what. Gingrich picked up an endorsement from Herman Cain. It's not unlike getting Carrot Top's endorsement for an Academy Award. It's the least he could do to thank Gingrich for all the pizza he ordered over the years. It's adorable Herman Cain thinks anyone is still listening to him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Here's a Newt Gingrich-related item Snoop might approve of. A rap song written to support the former Speaker of the House. When you think of rap, the name Gingrich doesn't necessarily come to mind. The closest he got is when he accidentally ate a CD because it said Eminem on it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, I guess Mitt Romney expected to win.

Hey, and when Newt Gingrich takes a vow, he sticks with it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Obama has been working on a new plan to boost tourism in America by making it easier for foreigners to get into the United States. We have that already. It's called Mexico, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about this? After wowing a crowd at the Apollo Theater with his singing voice, producers at 'American Idol' have invited President Obama to sing on their show this season.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well Newt says if he's elected he wants to build a colony on the moon. Going to build a colony on the moon. And people say, 'Well, not a bad idea but why?&quot; And he says 'I want to be the first American to get divorced on the moon.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In my free time I go to eBay. You ever go to the eBay? ... They're selling an old car that President Obama owned when he lived in Illinois. It's a 2005 Chrysler.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Florida primary is happening as we speak. The candidates are pulling all the stops.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Studies are showing that Republican candidates are buying a lot of their ad time on the Weather Channel. Yeah. You can tell because last night the weatherman blamed the cold front on immigration and gay marriage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear the latest? The government may be legally required to release the video of Osama bin Laden's killing. Yeah, President Obama said this would be unhelpful, inflammatory and could you please release it two days before the election?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Newt's outreach to Hispanic voters has coincided with the Florida primary. Of course to really crack the Sunshine State you have to go for the gray hairs, the oldsters, the wrinkle factories, the death adjacent. And Mitt Romney is all over them like white on Mitt Romney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, tonight is the all-important Florida primary. Now normally I do my show live, but tonight I pre-taped it at 7:30 because that is midnight for the average Floridian. So I don't know whether Mitt Romney or Newt Gingrich won, but we do know one thing for certain-- tomorrow both of them can go back to ignoring Latinos.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Politicians have to reach a lot of different people in Florida. It's a very diverse population. You have old people there and then really old people there. That's why third place in today's primary went to bunion cream.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Republican nomination process still has a long way to go. The winner today gets 50 delegates, but you need 1,100 delegates to win the nomination. And if you get 10,000 points, you get three stars on level eight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congratulations to Mitt Romney. He won the Republican primary in Florida. But, Mitt Romney is very modest. He acknowledges he could not have done it alone. He said, 'No man is a Cayman Island,' and I thought that was very nice.&quot;</SPAN></P>

After all he lost badly in Florida and the Republican establishment appears to hate him as much as everyone who is not a Republican.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[On Romney's comments on the poor] &quot;Did you just suggest you don't need to care about the very rich because they're fine but also equivalently the very poor because they're okay, too? Because you know the reason the net is there is they're not okay. It's like a doctor going, 'I'm not concerned about the very healthy because they're doing fine, or the very sick because, you know -- morphine.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, Mitt didn't just beat Newt Gingrich. He stomped him by a devastating 14% margin, 14%. That is higher than Mitt's tax rate. Romney kicked Newt to the curb like a plant manager whose job he just moved to another country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To drive home his commitment, Newt's campaign printed out these '46 States to Go' posters. Of course, since Newt's not even on the ballot in Virginia and Missouri, those 46 states may actually refer to the many states of his campaign including denial, anger, acoustic, cubist, depression, emo, bargaining, trekkie, and finally, acceptance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So settle in, everybody, settle in. Because this thing will not be over until Newt is no longer mad at Mitt. I'm going to say around star date 8130.3&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Yesterday, in Florida, Mitt Romney won the Republican presidential primary election. He beat Newt Gingrich handily. Political analysts think that elderly voters in Florida rejected Newt Gingrich because he would eventually leave them for a younger, healthier state.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Mitt Romney, meanwhile, is getting some heat, today, for something he said on CNN this morning. ... He's not concerned about the very poor. I'm pretty sure you're not supposed to say that out loud. I don't know which is worse, Romney being dishonest or Romney being honest. Romney would have been a great mean-looking rich guy from a movie in the '80s, wouldn't he have? Romney said the quote was taken out of context. And that he absolutely cares about the poor. In fact, his campaign bus runs on the tears of the poor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a great day but not a great day for Mitt Romney. He won in Florida yesterday, but today went and put his foot in his mouth. He said in interview today, quote 'I'm not concerned about the very poor.' Is anybody even trying to win this? To be fair, to Mitt Romney, the 'very poor' means anyone who doesn't use a solid gold toilet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Newt Gingrich came in second yesterday, but has vowed to stay in the race. He said he's staying all the way to the end, no matter what. People are comparing him to Hillary Clinton in 2008. Look, Hillary Clinton and Newt Gingrich are very similar. Both spent the 1990's trying to find out who Bill Clinton was sleeping with.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Chicago, a man shot a three and a half inch nail into his head with a nail gun and spent the rest of the day with the nail imbedded in his skull. Turns out he's part of a new reality show called 'Things I'd Rather Do Than Watch Another Republican Debate.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the next caucus is this Saturday in Nevada. You see, Nevada has something for all the candidates. It's got legalized prostitution, which is part of Ron Paul's campaign, he wants to legalize it. It's got a large Mormon population. That's good for Mitt Romney. It welcomes losers. That's perfect for Rick Santorum. And it's got no fault divorce, which is tailor made for Newt Gingrich. So it's the perfect state.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you heard Mitt Romney is now getting Secret Service protection. That's just to protect him from the poor. Did you hear about that? In an interview on CNN yesterday -- talk about a tin ear, Mitt Romney said he is not concerned with the very poor. Yeah, that statement worked out well for Marie Antoinette, didn't it? Yeah, saw what happened there. Wait 'til November when Mitt finds out most people aren't concerned about the very rich.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Donald Trump has now endorsed Mitt Romney. Imagine that. A billionaire reaching out to a millionaire. The two classes coming together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The other day Mitt Romney said he's not concerned about the very poor. And what he is talking about there, he means people making less than a million.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, you know what happened earlier today, Mitt Romney was endorsed by Donald Trump. You know what that means, ladies and gentlemen -- nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After losing in Florida, Newt Gingrich is campaigning hard in Las Vegas. Gingrich says he loves Las Vegas because it has two of his favorite things, buffets and wedding chapels&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some big election news. Today Donald Trump announced that he's endorsing Mitt Romney for President. It was really nice. It was really nice. Trump was like, 'There's only one man with the brains, the skills and the charisma to be President. But since I'm not running, you might as well vote for Mitt Romney.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I never saw Trump as a Romney guy. ... I mean seriously, what would Trump and Romney have in common? What does Trump see when he looks at Romney? [As Trump] 'Oh, this guy, he likes firing people, he loves corporations, the only thing I'm not crazy about is the whole same wife for 42 years thing, but you know, I can overlook it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So Donald Trump and Mitt Romney join forces showing Americans that if two Ivy League educated successful business tycoons from wealthy families can find common ground, even when one is a billionaire and the other only a multi-multi-multimillionaire, maybe there's hope this country isn't so divided after all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, well. Nation, you know, I have been talking about Super PACs for almost a year now. They were created after the Supreme Court's Citizens United ruling which allowed unlimited corporate individual or union donations for political speech. I like to think of them as a give a penny, take an election, tray.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Half of the candidates' Super PAC money, $67 million, came from just 22 individuals. Now I am sure that the good government goo-goos out there are saying that this is just handing all the power to the 1%. When in fact, 22 people out of a population of 300 million people is in fact, 7/11,000,000 of 1%. So Occupy Wall Street, you are going to want to change those signs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, this is what the Supreme Court intended with their Citizens United ruling. Twenty-two billionaires deciding who our next leader would be. Now I'm sure it's the way that the 22 billionaires who chose our Founding Fathers would want it. So join me in honoring these 22 patriots who have given so much and expect so much in return.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;In Las Vegas today, Donald Trump made a surprise endorsement of Mitt Romney for President. Of course, this is huge for Romney, as goes Trump, so go Meatloaf. And Donald made the endorsement. And Mitt climbed into Donald's golden helicopter, and they flew around the country, dropping silver dollars on the homeless and unemployed.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week in Indianapolis, Federal authorities seized $5 million worth of counterfeit Super Bowl merchandise. You know one of the ways you can tell if Super Bowl merchandise is phony? If it has the word 'Cleveland Browns' on it.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the TSA is training thousands of fast food vendors at the Super Bowl stadium to spot terrorists. For example, if they see a guy with an 'I Heart Al Qaeda' t-shirt holding a giant foam finger that's ticking, and he's yelling he wants his team to 'reign in blood' over the 'capitalist infidels,' he could be up to something.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, President Obama spoke at the National Prayer Breakfast yesterday. The President said that his Christian faith is the driving force behind his economic policies. So I guess instead of blaming Bush, it's now all Jesus' fault.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama said he says a brief prayer every morning, but then Joe Biden shows up anyway. So I don't know if it would really work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Word is before Donald Trump endorsed Mitt Romney this week, he was going to endorse Newt Gingrich. He promised Newt Gingrich. Then he changed his mind. Someone pledging loyalty to you and then breaking their promise. Hey, Newt, how does it feel?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney now taking a lot of heat for saying he's not concerned with the very poor. I don't think he helped himself. Like today he says he does care about the homeless. Especially the summer home-less. You know those people have no place to stay when they go to Martha's Vineyard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, Mitt Romney has now been assigned Secret Service protection. I don't want to say Mitt is a boring white guy, but his secret code name is 'Mayonnaise.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you know this, ladies and gentlemen; they're building an escape tunnel at the White House? Were you aware of this? So President Obama, when the escape tunnel is done, he can just get in the tunnel and escape, and people are saying, 'Really? What?' And I said, 'Hell, he's living with his mother-in-law! Come on, what do you think?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Newt Gingrich, of course, took a thumping in Florida. He won big in South Carolina. Then he goes to Florida, and he gets knocked around. So he's off to Minnesota, Newt's off to Minnesota. Mitt's off to Colorado, and Ron Paul is off to the Sierra Nevadas to look for the lost Dutchman Mine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Turns out that the owners of the Patriots and the Giants have each donated $5,000 to President Obama's campaign. Which explains why Fox News is predicting that both teams will lose the Super Bowl.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney, here's a guy having trouble. When you're in politics you have to be careful of everything you say. You have to monitor every word, every punctuation. He said at some kind of a banquet for rich people he said he wasn't worried about poor people. He said he didn't care for poor people. Something like that. And people said, 'What? You don't care about poor people?' So now he's backtracking and Mitt Romney is now saying he connects with poor people. 'I'm Mitt Romney, I connect with poor people.'

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Newt Gingrich says that people who ride on subways here in New York are the elite.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's an election update. Because of large crowds at his campaign events, Mitt Romney will now receive protection from the Secret Service. Not to be outdone, Ron Paul will now receive protection from a mall cop on a Segway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;You know, three elections today, they didn't mean much because no delegates are awarded during primaries in these states. It's a bigger waste of time than voting on 'American Idol.' Newt Gingrich didn't bother to campaign, really, in these states. But he's vowed to stay in the race until the Republican convention.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney has a new campaign slogan: 'What Happened?' Big night last night for Rick Santorum, winning three primaries, Colorado, Missouri and Minnesota. God, I haven't seen Rick Santorum this happy since they cancelled 'Will &amp; Grace.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rick Santorum says that he is what the Republicans really want. Mitt Romney says now that he knows what the Republicans want, he can change to those positions. That's not a problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in his speech yesterday, Rick Santorum declared that global warming was a hoax. He said, 'If you look at the science, you'll see our climate has been the same ever since dinosaurs roamed the earth over 150 years ago.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Donald Trump announced he is building a new hotel four blocks from the White House. And with any luck, that will be about as close to the White House as Donald Trump will ever get.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you realize there were three primaries yesterday? It was like Missouri, Minnesota, and -- another state. I think it was Colorado. Mitt Romney lost all three of those primaries. Today, he begged Donald Trump to take back his endorsement. ... It was a big, big setback for the Mitt Romney campaign; even the very poor said they felt bad for him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That Mitt Romney, say what you will about the guy, but he's stiff. And people on the inside tell me that the first thing he's going to do when he's elected President, if that happens, he's going to outlaw casual Friday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney-- and I don't want to try to affect or influence people when they go into that voting booth, but just remember one thing: Mitt Romney is the guy that drives around with the dog on the roof of his car. I won't rest until PETA comes and puts the cuffs on this guy and drags him downtown screaming like a baby. I don't care how you vote. I don't care who you like, but we're Americans, by God, and do we really want to be represented by a guy who for the rest of his life will be known as the maniac who strapped his dog to the roof of the Dodge station wagon and drove to Canada? No! You think the rest of the world hates us now?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rick Santorum was the big winner. He won yesterday, Colorado, Minnesota, also Missouri. Feeling very cocky. And that's when you get in trouble when you start feeling cocky. Rick Santorum already has ordered and is being fitted for an inaugural sweater vest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I think Santorum's victory proves that old adage about politics: give voters what they want. In this case, intolerance and homophobia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Three wins for Rick Santorum. Since yesterday's primaries, Rick Santorum's campaign has received $250,000 in donations. Yeah, when Mitt Romney heard this he said, ' $250,000? Oh, that's cute. Aren't you a good little candidate?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of Romney, this is crazy -- a condom company has launched a special line of Mitt Romney condoms. Yeah, the Romney condom is perfect for the lover who likes to constantly change his positions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some big election news. Big, major upset. Last night, Rick Santorum scored a hat trick by winning the caucuses in Colorado and Minnesota, and the Missouri primary. While Newt Gingrich scored a hat trick by eating at a combination KFC, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Joe Biden made a phone call to Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping. Yep, Jinping asked Biden if he had any solutions for the economy, while Biden asked if he knew the bear from 'Kung Fu Panda.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is interesting. A new study found that 94% of $1 bills carry germs. Or as Mitt Romney put it, 'That's why I only use fifties and hundies.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;In politics, you know, they had three Republican primary elections yesterday. In Colorado, Minnesota and Missouri. And in a surprising turn of events, Rick Santorum won all three of them. I think people are voting for Rick Santorum for the same reason they voted for Sanjaya. Is it a joke or something? Santorum won by five points in Colorado, 18 points in Minnesota and 30 points in Missouri. Part of me thinks that Rick Santorum is running for President just to show his high school crush she should have gone to the prom with him. But he's doing well. He's the most conservative of the Republican candidates. He even called global warming a hoax, which is no surprise, coming from a guy who is clearly in the pocket of big sweater vests.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's a very exciting story. You may have seen this on the news. A man by the name of Felix Baumgartner hopes to set a world record by parachuting out of a balloon from over 20 miles high. He hopes to break the record for the longest free fall, currently held now by Mitt Romney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think Mitt Romney ? whew! Whew! Got hosed! Oh, Mitt got hosed this week. Rick Santorum won all three Republican primaries this is week in Colorado, Minnesota and Missouri. Beating out the front-runner, Mitt Romney, who is the wealthiest of all the Republican candidates. Romney said today he learned something. There are things that money can't buy. Like Colorado, Minnesota, Missouri.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He got beat up so bad on Tuesday ? today he was asked if he was covered by Obamacare. That's how bad. His campaign is in such bad shape, today he moved the part in his hair even further to the right. That's how bad. Things are so bad for Mitt Romney, he's now thinking about starting to talk to poor people. Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh! But he is not quitting. Romney says he will keep fighting. And you can take that all the way to the Swiss bank.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, after the big win Tuesday night, they asked Rick Santorum if he thought his campaign was evolving but, you know, he doesn't believe in evolution. So I don't think...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a bad night for Newt Gingrich. You know, in terms that Newt can understand, I think the voters told Newt they want to start seeing other candidates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Donald Trump announced this week he is building a new hotel four blocks from the White House. Today, President Obama demanded to see his long form builder's permit. 'Okay, I'm going to have to go over it very, very carefully.' How quickly they forget.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Newt Gingrich in the news. Newt Gingrich still battling hard for the Republican nomination. Doing his best. Newt Gingrich is trying to save his campaign by focusing only on areas where he has the most support. Yeah, so he's mostly focusing on Georgia, Tennessee and the Cheesecake Factory. Huge there. Done enough for them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Meanwhile Mitt Romney trying hard to connect with voters. People say he's not connecting. He seems like he's too affluent. In his campaign Mitt Romney has talking about his father's humble beginnings as a carpenter. Yeah. He said, I'll never forget the day my dad started building our fourth beach house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some major, major business news. Apple is facing a $38 million fine in China, because the word iPad is trademarked by a Chinese company. Apple is nervous about owing money to China, but then Obama was like, 'Ah, you get used to it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This Saturday is the drawing for one of the biggest Powerball jackpots in history. It means one lucky winner is could be worth $300 million. Or as Mitt Romney calls that, middle class.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of Mitt Romney, a man in Colorado is facing six months in jail for throwing glitter at Romney on Tuesday. Of course, he could get released early for fabulous behavior.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, as you know, President Obama will not require Catholic institutions to pay for birth control for employees. President Obama made this decision after realizing his economic plan will have to be paid for by our grandchildren. And birth control pretty much puts the kibosh on that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to a new statistic, the United States ranks 19th among other countries for producing math and science graduates. 19th. And here's how bad it is. Okay? American students thought 19th place put them in the top ten.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney, he loves Valentine's Day. Today he sent a dozen long-stemmed red roses to his money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who's the hot Republican candidate right now? Rick Santorum. A few years ago I had to go away and spend some time in a Santorum. I'm okay now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some election news this weekend was the Maine caucuses. And here's the crazy part. Adele actually won that, too. Isn't that amazing?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Get this, in a new interview, Rick Santorum said women might not be suited for military action because their emotions aren't suited for combat. Which would mean only one thing. He has never seen an episode of 'The View.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, congratulations to Mitt Romney. He won the Maine Republican caucus. Finally, he has something now that, as a rich white guy, he can honestly talk to people in Maine about -- eating lobster.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an interview today with ABC News, Rick Perry said the debates have absolutely nothing to do with governing. And he may be right. Luckily, debates have absolutely everything to do with the fact that he won't be President.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping visited President Obama at the White House yesterday. ... Do you know why he came to the United States? Oh gosh, there must be 15 trillion reasons, huh? And I thought this was nice. While he's at the White House, the Chinese Vice President showed President Obama pictures of his children. And the factories where they work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It looks like President Obama may have significantly reduced our trade deficit with China. While he was at the White House, President Obama sold the Chinese Vice President one billion Jeremy Lin jerseys at $50 a piece.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And earlier this week, President Obama unveiled his new $3.8 trillion budget. $3.8 trillion. That is more money than Mitt Romney makes in a week. Do you know that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And because of our $15 trillion debt, new cuts in NASA's budget may end future searches for life in other planets. Well, that seems like a big mistake, doesn't it? I mean, shouldn't we be looking for other planets to borrow money from? China's almost tapped out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as part of his Valentine's Day tradition, Newt Gingrich bought his wife a 'not quite forever' diamond. Yeah, beautiful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Mitt Romney and his wife wanted to spend a nice, quiet Valentine's night just by themselves. So they went to one of Mitt's campaign rallies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the US has expanded travel warnings to Mexico to almost half the country now. In fact, Americans tourists are pretty nervous. In fact, they say Americans walking around Mexico are almost as nervous as Mexicans walking around Arizona.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that Rick Santorum? ... They're saying now it looks like the state of Michigan is swinging towards Rick Santorum. Yup. And I think if there's a word that best describes Rick Santorum it would be 'swinging.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're saying now that Rick Santorum is gaining momentum because he's not Romney. He's not Romney and they told Romney and Mitt Romney was furious and he 'Well, I could do that.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Then they had Newt Gingrich. You know Newt Gingrich, don't you? ... So anyway, Newt is at the zoo and they took him to see a panda and this is supposed to somehow in our minds let us know that Newt and China would be a good -- that he could interact with China because he gets along with a panda which comes from China. So if you saw the footage it was amazing. You think about it. This massive creature, nearly extinct, and then, of course, there was the panda.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is in Los Angeles today hoping to raise millions of dollars. Yeah. Which may be why I saw him in the audience line this morning at 'The Price is Right.' Barack Obama, come on down! That's what he should do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Democratic fundraiser is offering a one on one dinner with the President for $35,000. Unfortunately the only person in America who can afford it is Mitt Romney. That's going to be awkward.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rick Santorum picked up an endorsement from the lead singer of the heavy metal band Megadeth. Yeah. In other words Santorum is the only candidate who is both pro-life and pro Megadeth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big international news. After disputes over its nuclear program, Iran is threatening to stop exporting oil. Which means the US may have to tap into its backup reserve, Mitt Romney's hair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of Mitt Romney, according to a new poll, 39% of voters say the more they know about Romney, the less they like him. Which explains his new campaign slogan, 'Mitt Romney' -- that's it. That's the slogan. Just stops right there, before you can even get a bad taste in your mouth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday Newt Gingrich got to feed a panda while he was visiting the San Diego Zoo. He was, like, 'Look how much this giant animal loves food.' Yeah. The panda said that, not Newt Gingrich.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, a lot of celebrities are now coming forward with their political endorsements. This week, the lead singer of the heavy metal band, Megadeth, says he's endorsing Rick Santorum. That's what he said. Me, I'm going to wait until I hear what Lemmy from Motorhead has to say.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Rick Santorum said this week he wants to restore religious values to government. You know, like they do in Iran.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, believe me, Rick Santorum, very conservative when it comes to sexual issues. Very conservative. Today, he said he would ban In-N-Out Burger. He is so conservative, he only flies Virgin Airlines. He is so conservative; he thinks you need to be 18 or older to look at the Washington Monument. Let me tell you how conservative Rick Santorum is. He wants 'Glee' renamed 'The Morally Confused Dance Club.' That's how conservative. He is so conservative; he won't even order a bone-in ribeye. That's how conservative he is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;China's Vice President was in Los Angeles today. When he got off the plane, he apologized for his problem with the language. Apparently, his interpreter doesn't speak Spanish. So it was awkward.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is kind of a big deal. The border patrol seized, listen to this, a shipment of 10,000 unsafe hair dryers. ... Thank God, Mitt Romney didn't get his hands on one of those babies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Would you vote for Mitt Romney, would you? ... Yeah, he's sinking in the polls. Do you know what that is? That is the magic of a Donald Trump endorsement, right there ladies and gentlemen. That's how that works.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll tell you something right now. I know nothing about politics and I don't care. Here is what I know about politics. We've got no money. That's all I know. I don't know where it went; I think China has all our money. I'm not sure. That's all I know about politics but everybody when there's a campaign, when there is a race, a general election, like to think that they know. Listen to this. The band Megadeath, you know Megadeath. They now have endorsed Rick Santorum. I think I'm going to wait and see who Metallica likes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know Rick Santorum. It looks like he's running for student council. He has a slogan; the slogan is 'Fear the Sweater Vest.' Because he always says the cute little sweater vests on. And it's important; you have got to have a slogan. Ron Paul, you know Ron Paul. His slogan is 'Fear the Polly Grip.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Newt Gingrich, I mean, come on, he's up and down and up and down. ... Newt Gingrich called his staff and said, 'Am I in trouble?' They said, 'Let me put it to you this way, Newt, you have more ex-wives than delegates.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top Ten Questions On The Application To Become A Mitt Romney Look-Alike:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. Do you look like Mitt Romney?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Does Mitt Romney look like you?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. True or False: You look like Mitt Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Do you not look like someone who doesn't look like Mitt Romney?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. If you wore a sombrero, would you look like Mitt Romney wearing a sombrero?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. What do you feel is your main qualification, other than a strong resemblance to Mitt Romney?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. During sex, does your wife ever yell out, 'Mitt Romney!'?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Do you know any fat, doughy guys who look like Newt Gingrich?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Can you smile while driving with a dog strapped to the roof of your car?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Do you mind being unemployed after November?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the United States there are nearly 1.8 million dead people who are still registered to vote. Yeah. Dead people are still registered to vote. Yeah. As a matter of fact, they're the group that's most passionate about Mitt Romney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During a speech yesterday, President Obama said, 'Ask what you can do to bring jobs back to your country, and your country will do everything we can to help you succeed.' Then, he added, 'Speaking of jobs, anyone know of a good speechwriter because that quote sucked?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, this week President Obama visited a factory in Wisconsin that just brought back 100 jobs from China. That's got to be tough. That's got to be tough for the workers in China who lost their jobs. But, you know, kids always bounce right back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The primary season has shifted to Michigan, which you think would be a cakewalk for Mitt Romney. He grew up there, his father was governor there. For God's sake. He's named for the shape of Michigan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The glitter bomb has emerged as a weapon of choice for gay rights activists looking for a form of protest that's more clever than a pie in the face, but less clever than something actually clever. Almost all the Republican candidates have been hit, including Mitt Romney, Newt Gingrich and Michele Bachmann. Glitter bombing is such a concern the Secret Service is now using specially trained glitter bomb sniffing dogs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Good news for President Obama today. His approval rating is up to 50%. Only half the country dislikes him. That's good. Apparently his strategy of not being any of the Republican candidates is paying off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Just to give you perspective on Obama's approval rating, here's how he stacks up against others. Obama is at 50% positive. Mitt Romney is at 42% positive. Ice cream, ahead of both of them, at 97%. Creamy peanut butter, in at 83%. Chunky, 40%. Scrunchies, are down to 43%. Santorum, 33%. His sweater vest is at 17%. And with a 1% approval rating, sporks. Sporks do kind of suck, though.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gas prices still rising in California, over $4 a gallon now, $4.25, $4.30. And they're predicting $5 a gallon by summer. And you can tell gas prices are going up.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Happy Presidents Day. This is, of course, the day we celebrate the guys we didn't like when they were in office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of Presidents Day sales. Although Mitt Romney got a little confused. He thought the presidency was for sale. No, no. Totally different.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And although the New Jersey assembly approved a bill legalizing same-sex marriage, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has vetoed it. You know something? If Chris Christie was 250 pounds lighter and looked good in a tank top, he would have signed that in a heartbeat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Italian authorities seized $6 trillion worth of fake, worthless US Treasury bonds. Pretty good counterfeit job, too. They look just like the genuine worthless Treasury bonds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney, you know how Mitt Romney celebrates Presidents Day? He straps his dog to the roof of a Lincoln.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Listen, listen to this. Young people are jumping on the Ron Paul bandwagon. Now that's not a figure of speech. Ron Paul actually travels on a bandwagon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have some election news. I heard that Microsoft founder Bill Gates attended a fundraiser for President Obama on Friday. Yeah, he wasn't invited, but in typical Microsoft fashion he crashed it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, speaking of the election, CNN announced that instead of using podiums at Wednesday's debate, the GOP candidates will be sitting at a table. Which could get awkward when Newt Gingrich asks to see a menu.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation if you read the news you know that the Michigan primary is one week from tomorrow and the Romney campaign has made it clear this is do-or-die for Mitt. The thing is even though Michigan is his home state; Romney trails Rick Santorum by four points in the latest polls. That has got to be a shock for Mitt. I mean the whole state is shaped like a him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is no secret that Mitt Romney is having trouble connecting with the average American. Even though they have so much in common. For instance, they both feel awkward around Mitt Romney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In recent primaries Colorado, Minnesota and Missouri Mitt got his ass handed to him by Rick Santorum which is especially impressive because the ass is a body part neither of them will admit exists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wish people would stop believing the bizarre stories about US Presidents. George Washington did not have wooden teeth. No!

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, I got to tell you. I'm still a little on edge. Kind of a frightening, I got robbed last night. It's unbelievable. I got robbed. I pulled over to the gas station. A guy points a gas hose at me, and goes, ' $4.50 a gallon.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, as you know, oil prices jumped to well over $100 a barrel, and analysts say it's due to tension in the Middle East. So, luckily, it's just a temporary thing, huh? Whew. How long can that last? Another 10,000 or 12,000 years, maybe?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Italian police seized $6 trillion worth of fake, worthless US bonds. Let that be a lesson. If you want to try and sell worthless financial instruments, you better be Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Rick Santorum says Satan has his sights set on the United States of America. Satan, let me tell you this. It's not going to be easy getting America because you're going to have to fight the Chinese for it. They own it now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rick Santorum also said that global warming is politics, not science. And he says he will defend that position to the edge of the earth.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know why this isn't a bigger issue. He [Romney] tied his damn dog to the roof of his car! George Washington, 'I cannot tell a lie.

Every time we have stupid pet tricks here I go outside and everybody from PETA's like, 'Hey, you can't do that!' This guy ties his dog a car, to a Volvo, drives to Canada!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney is in the news. It's been reported that Mitt Romney's campaign is spending cash twice as fast as they're earning it. Hey, it turns out he is just like us, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new article claims that if Abraham Lincoln ran for President today, he could not get elected as a Republican. Mainly because if he tried to free the slaves, other Republicans would say, 'Abraham Lincoln, bad for small business.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Political analysts say the key voting block this election will be a group of women called birth control moms. Birth control moms are women who use birth control but apparently not correctly.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new study found that 16% of Americans under the age of 24 don't have a job. Yeah. There's even a name for that group, art history majors.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Bob Morris, a state lawmaker from Fort Wayne, Indiana, decided not to support a proposal that would celebrate 100th anniversary of the Girl Scouts.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here is an interesting statistic. The Federal government reporting today that in 2011, Americans drove fewer miles on the road than since the year 2003. People drove fewer miles last year than they did eight years ago. Experts aren't sure why. I'll give you three reasons. Exxon, Chevron, Texaco.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; $5 a gallon. In some parts of Florida, $6 a gallon. They say it's because of tensions with Iran. See, things are so much more streamlined now. Now, we get to pay for the next war even before it starts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Newt Gingrich says President Obama doesn't recognize the threats from radical Islamists. This is what I love. One week, they say Obama is a radical Islamist. The next week, he doesn't know anything about them. Make up your mind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today, of course, Ash Wednesday. I saw Mitt Romney. He had some ashes on his head. He's not Catholic. It was soot from his campaign blowing up in his face.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rick Santorum said today that during his 16 years in Congress, he was an outsider the whole time. You know what? After 16 years, you're not an outsider, okay? You're just unpopular.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rick Santorum says that Satan has his sights set on the United States of America. And today, Satan said he tries to avoid politics because it makes him feel dirty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Newt, he was taking a look at the Chevy Volt. He's talking about economy cars, small cars, he said only problem with that was you can't put a gun rack in it. Can't put a gun rack in a Chevy Volt. Mitt Romney said 'Who the hell cares as long as you can tie a dog to it?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During a concert at the White House yesterday, did you hear about this, President Obama got on stage and performed with Mick Jagger. Yeah. Apparently, Obama wanted to prove to Republicans that he could work with a rich old white guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today Newt Gingrich said we should use covert operations to assassinate Iran's nuclear scientists. Yeah. Gingrich also said the key to covert operations is announcing them on the campaign trail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today is Ash Wednesday, all over the country people are giving things up for Lent. In my opinion, Rick Santorum should give up chocolate. While Newt Gingrich should give up -- that's it. He should just give up. I just think he should give up. He doesn't have a chance. It's just a waste of time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You guys, it's National Pancake Week. Yeah! Of course, Mitt Romney was in a debate tonight, so it's also National Waffle Week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;There was a debate tonight between the remaining Republican candidates for President tonight in Mesa, Arizona. The 26th debate, which is -- that's a lot of debates. If I argue with someone 26 times, we're probably going to break up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;A big topic amongst the candidates and the voters lately has been electability. Meaning, they're trying to figure out which one of them is most likely to beat Barack Obama in the general election, which, at this point is kind of like four nerds sitting around arguing about which one is most likely to have sex with Megan Fox.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Rick Santorum is in the middle of another strange controversy. Someone dug up a speech that Rick Santorum gave during the 2008 election, when no one was paying him much attention. In that speech, Santorum said that he believes that Satan has his sights on America and we need to be aware of that. Apparently Satan is still upset about the time he went down to Georgia and lost that fiddle. Well, it was his favorite fiddle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;But it is kind of scary to imagine a guy who thinks Satan is targeting us specifically, having control of the largest nuclear arsenal in the world. But he did say it. The truth, running for President is kind of like a job interview. The applicants come in. They pitch themselves to us. And we decide which one gets the job. Imagine mentioning Satan in a job interview.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, they said in the news today that here in Los Angeles, the price of gas is flirting with $5 a gallon. That's what they said. Flirting. You know, we're beyond flirting. Okay, we're getting screwed now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, President Obama talked about the rising price of gas today. He said he understands that rising prices are making people worried and fearful. Especially in his re-election campaign. They're really fearful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama sang again this week during a concert at the White House. A lot of big celebrities there. BB King, Buddy Guy, Mick Jagger was there. Did you see that? Mick Jagger. You know, Mick Jagger hasn't been in the White House since the British burned it down in 1812.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, I saw the worst reality show last night. Have you seen this one? It's called 'The Republican Debate.' Anybody watch that? It was on CNN. You know who the big winner was? 'American Idol' on Fox.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see Newt Gingrich, Mitt Romney, Ron Paul, Rick Santorum all sitting together in a row? Didn't it look like the 99 cent version of Mount Rushmore?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, people are saying that last night's debate could be the last Republican debate of the campaign. Oh, no! Come on! Who can't get enough of four rich white guys sitting around talking about birth control? Come on! I want to know more!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was one embarrassing moment on the campaign trail today for Mitt Romney. He was going through airport security. When Mitt emptied his pockets, Ron Paul fell out. Did you see that? This is what's going on. Rick Santorum is claiming that Mitt Romney and Ron Paul have teamed up against him. Which is kind of ironic -- that Santorum can be brought down by two men forming a civil union.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rick Santorum, oh, man, like he was going to be something and now it's kind of collapsed and he's got a new campaign slogan. That's the key. You have to have a catchy campaign slogan. And his is 'Fear the Sweater Vest.' Newt Gingrich's is 'Fear the Chins.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The debate was in Arizona. And to appeal to Arizona voters Mitt Romney drove there with a coyote tied to the roof. True story.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In last night's Republican debate, the candidates were asked to describe themselves in one word. Rick Santorum said, 'Courage,' Ron Paul said, 'Consistent' and Newt Gingrich said, 'Booty-licious.' Weird. Makes me like him now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Two of the biggest topics at last night's GOP debate were illegal immigration and birth control. Those were the two. I think Ron Paul got confused because he said we should build a fence around women and pull out of Mexico. It was weird. I thought that was strange.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, the Republicans had their 20th debate. And did you see this? Rick Perry was actually in the audience. He was sitting in the audience. It got awkward when he stood up and he was, like, 'I just remembered the third department I'd cut!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At one point Ron Paul said that Rick Santorum is a fake, and Santorum responded by saying, 'I'm real.' And then Romney was, like, 'Yeah, I'm a real human, too, ha ha ha. Let's change the subject.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's begin in Arizona, the site of last night's Republican debate. Believe it or not, the 20th debate of this campaign season. One more and the debate will be able to drink legally. Mostly to forget about the terrible things they've heard in these debates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Newt Gingrich told reporters yesterday that for Lent, he's giving up desserts. So, if you're anywhere in the vicinity of Newt Gingrich for the next few weeks, don't wear anything that might possibly resemble pie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although gas is close to $5 a gallon here in California, I'm told it's $6 a gallon in parts of Florida. Six bucks. In fact, gas is so expensive in Miami; even young people are driving 20 miles an hour.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But President Obama talked about the rising gas prices today. He focused on the positive things his Administration has done when it comes to energy prices. So, in other words, it was the shortest speech he's ever given, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what I think? I think President Obama is starting to get a little overconfident. In an interview with Univision radio yesterday, he said, 'My presidency isn't over yet, and I've still got five more years.' Five more years. Even his predictions are over budget.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Rick Santorum has stated that Satan has his sight set on the United States of America. Satan is coming to America. Hey, have you looked around lately? Gas is 5 bucks a gallon. The Kardashians are on TV every hour. Paris Hilton has another album coming out. I think Satan is already here, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rick Santorum, very conservative. Here's the deal. I figured this out. Mitt Romney has been the front-runner from day one but nobody likes Mitt Romney because he's not kooky enough. They want somebody kooky to be the President. They're looking for somebody kookier so Rick Santorum is a pretty good choice. He does not believe in birth control, does not believe in birth control. Does not believe in global warming. Does not believe in long sleeve sweaters. I mean, he's crazy, this guy. But the latest polls show Romney and Rick Santorum neck and neck. Neck and neck if you can believe that. Not to be confused with Newt Gingrich who is shown in the polls as chin to chin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a tough game for the New York Knicks last night. Jeremy Lin went just one for 11 in their loss to Miami. Yeah, only one success out of 11 attempts. Or, as Newt Gingrich calls that, primary season.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, here's an election update. President Obama's campaign is apparently selling its own iPhone cases. Not to be outdone, Newt Gingrich's campaign is selling those beepers that vibrate when your table's ready at the Olive Garden.&quot;</SPAN></P>

You know, I don't want to say Romney is a rich guy but he kept asking the guys, 'Hey, during the race you drive yourself or you have a chauffeur, huh?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rick Santorum has attacked President Obama and called him a snob. He's a snob for saying everybody in America should go to college. It sounds bad. But, Santorum does have a point. Hey, this is America. Where people who don't have an education or don't even know basic facts can still grow up to be Governor of Alaska. Reading, it's not for everybody.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Romney and Santorum are battling over who is more conservative. I think Santorum -- he is conservative. This guy is so conservative, as a kid, he refused to play with an erector set. Santorum is so conservative he won't go to a junk yard out of fear he might see another man's junk. That's how bad. He won't even blow on his soup, okay? That's how conservative.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Donald Trump endorsed Mitt Romney and I didn't realize, Donald Trump and Mitt Romney are apparently very good friends. As a matter of fact, Mitt lets that thing on Trump's head, you know that thing? He lets that ride around on the top of his car any time he wants! Any time he wants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rick Santorum is looking better and better and better to me. He now claims he's against separation of church and state. He's against separation of church and state. But he's not against separation of sweaters and sleeves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And now a guy, a very wealthy guy, a billionaire, a crazy billionaire is going to give Newt Gingrich $100 million. $100 million. And Newt Gingrich, his fire, his flame has all but extinguished. He's so excited now he's saying 'Oh, man, a hundred million, now I can come pretty close to settling up my bill at Tiffany's.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is exciting news. Bill Clinton, former President Bill Clinton has been named a nominee for this year's Nobel Peace Prize. Yeah, this will be his first trip to Sweden that he can actually tell Hillary about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, what a snob. Obama thinks everybody should go to college like he did. Well, pardon me, your highness, but some of us weren't handed a ticket to Harvard by being the biracial son of a single mother on food stamps. Must be nice. Santorum thank you. Thank you. Rick Santorum understands the real American dream -- that if you work hard enough your children can have fewer opportunities than you did.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about this? Kid Rock has formally endorsed Mitt Romney. How did those two hook up? Doesn't Kid Rock look like the guy that Mitt Romney's neighborhood watch group would call the cops on? 'Hey, there's a guy here. He's got a hat on and a torn shirt.' Anyway, Mitt Romney now joins Coors Light, Red Stag Bourbon and Pamela Anderson's hooha as things Kid Rock has officially endorsed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today of course, the Michigan primary. You don't know who won. But, you see Mitt Romney is having trouble connecting with real voters. But Republican leaders say he'll be better in the fall against Barack Obama. That's because they're going to upgrade Mitt's software this summer and reprogram him to be more lifelike.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And starting this week, Rick Santorum will get Secret Service protection. They say they want to protect him against any dangerous religious fanatics, you know, like Rick Santorum.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Santorum has attacked President Obama...calling him a snob. He's a snob for saying he wants every kid in America to go to college. What a snobby thing to say, that is. Well you can't blame Santorum. The more people to go to college, the less chance he'll have of being elected. So it makes perfect sense, really. This was very clever on Santorum's part. See, he was trying to pick up the dumbass vote left behind by Rick Perry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rick Santorum, and oh man, he's given Mitt a run for his money. He's saying the kids that go to college are snobs. Rick Santorum has a new program for children; it's called Every Child Left Behind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I had to vote right now I would be voting for Ron Paul. Who is with me on that? He reminds me of the guy that's always walking around the house with his robe open.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top Ten Other Things Mitt Romney Says He Likes About Michigan Trees:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. I seem less wooden standing next to one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. In a pinch, sap makes a great hair gel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. They're also just the right width.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. It's fun hiring illegal immigrants to rake up their leaves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. They're not gay like palm trees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. They don't shed their foliage as quickly as those slutty Rhode Island trees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. They look great next to my wife's Cadillacs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Trees don't whine when strapped to your car roof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. They're not afraid to stand up to the auto industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Like me, they lean whichever way the wind blows.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Romney and Santorum are neck and neck in Michigan. Mitt Romney has accused Rick Santorum of saying outrageous things just so Santorum can appeal to his most extreme voters. Santorum denied this and said, 'That's exactly the kind of misrepresentation I would expect from gay abortion doctor Mitt Romney.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear, Mitt Romney is using Kid Rock 'Born Free.' It's better than his previous choice 'Born Free Thanks to a Generous Inheritance.' Quite catchy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Mitt Romney accused the other GOP candidates of pandering to voters to get support. Romney was like, 'I would never pander to voters. I mean, unless you guys want me to.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And finally, tomorrow is Leap Day, you guys. This is something that only happens once every four years. Or as Newt Gingrich calls that, a sit-up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;The Republican primaries were held in Michigan and Arizona today, where Mitt Romney found himself neck and neck with Rick Santorum in his own home state of Michigan. Santorum has been surging in the polls lately. Apparently voters are responding to his message of no birth control and an end to public schools and then the sweater vest just seals the deal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Romney was hoping to win big in Michigan tonight since it's where he first went to school, where he first tried to impress a girl by telling her how much his pants cost. It was even the place where he first tied a puppy to the top of a big-wheel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Romney got an unexpected boost from Kid Rock last night. Kid Rock showed up at a Romney rally and did an impromptu concert. Kid Rock gave Mitt Romney his endorsement. Unfortunately he also endorsed porn, Jack Daniels and Hepatitis C while he was at it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today was the Michigan Republican primary it went right down to the wire. We're live, of course, so if results are in. Do we have a graph? What? Wait. Ron Paul finished first? Wait a minute. Let me see that. That's a poll of which candidate looks most like Dame Judi Dench. They do have a point.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The real story from the Michigan primary is Mitt Romney had some trouble winning his home state. For a politician, losing their home state is unthinkable. Could you imagine being rejected from the place you call home? That's like Bill Clinton getting thrown out of a strip club.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Romney campaign says they can't figure out why the people of Michigan aren't embracing their native son. Hmmm, let's see. Could it be this editorial he wrote four years ago? 'Let Detroit Go Bankrupt' That's got to work against you. Whether or not you agree with him, that shows Romney had the vision to put his foot in his mouth years before his competitors. But it's nothing compared to this piece he wrote last week for the 'Arizona Republic.' Look at this. 'Accept Your New Mexican Overlords.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, congratulations to Mitt Romney, he won in Arizona and Michigan. Mitt Romney is so excited, he almost loosened his tie. Did you see that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not a good day for Rick Santorum. I haven't seen him this depressed, well, since they invented the birth control pill. He's so bummed out. But you know, I think Rick Santorum learned something yesterday. He learned that the Electoral College is not for everyone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But see even though he won, Mitt Romney just has that problem. You know, connecting with regular people, regular voters. Like today they asked him if he was too concerned with which way the wind was blowing. And he said, 'Only when yachting.' See, that would be the wrong answer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you see on Monday, they asked Mitt Romney what he'd be willing to do to court the conservative vote. He said he 'wouldn't be willing to light his hair on fire.' Of course not. You ever seen his hair? You know how hard it is to put out a grease fire?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Meeting with reporters in Mexico. US Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano said that the war on drugs in Mexico is not a failure. Which surprised Mexican officials; they thought she was down there to surrender.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to NASA, a huge asteroid could collide with the earth in the year 2040. In 28 years we could be hit by a giant 500 foot diameter asteroid, yeah. The good news is, 2040 is an election year, so we will get out of that one at least.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney in his acceptance speech last night, his big winning speech in Michigan was very eloquent. He said, 'And now it's on to Super Tuesday.' And Newt Gingrich who apparently on paper is still in the race -- Newt Gingrich in his concession speech said, 'And now it's on to 'Dancing With the Stars.&quot;&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was certainly a close race there in Michigan, a real nail biter or, in Romney's case, a real manicure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the campaign was close and a lot of people thought this is where Rick Santorum makes his move and dumps Mitt Romney in his home state. Well, it didn't happen and the campaign, if you know anything about Mitt Romney you know one thing, you know here's a guy who can get down with the best of them. I mean, he can get down. They went crazy celebrating. A friend of mine who was in campaign headquarters said Romney after they won, after the lights were turned off and people were going home, Mitt Romney, crazy old Mitt, took off his jacket and chugged a glass of tap water.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nobody's got any money and you know anything about the stock market? I know nothing about the stock market. And yesterday it nudged up over 13,000 points. 13,000 points. What? What? Oh, I'm sorry; no that was New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's cholesterol.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big celebrity news. It's being reported that Snooki is pregnant. Have you heard this? Yeah. When Rick Santorum heard the news, he immediately came out in favor of birth control.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney won a squeaker in Michigan last night. Today in Detroit Mitt Romney asked supporters to donate money to his campaign. Yeah. Of course, the people pointed out that they live in Detroit and he's Mitt Romney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night Mitt Romney came in first place in the Michigan primary. Although he barely won. Incidentally, barely one is also the total number of votes Ron Paul received.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In yesterday's Michigan primary, Newt Gingrich actually came in fourth place. Or as the ice cream in his freezer put it, 'It's gonna be a long night.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of Newt Gingrich, yesterday he said that Mitt Romney is so closed-minded that he would have fired Christopher Columbus. Romney denied it, saying, 'Are you kidding me? A man with three boats, that's my kind of guy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Start the countdown to loving Mitt clock. We now have six days, 23 hours and 59 minutes to find a replacement for this robotic plutocrat who couldn't hold the attention of cats with a can of tuna. But after Super Tuesday when this clock runs out on, let's say, Suck It Up Wednesday, we conservatives will dutifully love Mitt Romney's whole grain lightly toasted vision for a fibrous and regular America. It will be good for us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Rick Santorum, as those of you who follow politics know, is not a fan of birth control. But this might possibly change his mind. It's not confirmed. But according to multiple news sources, Snooki from 'Jersey Shore,' is pregnant. Which is unusual. They don't usually mate in captivity.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually been a good week for Mitt Romney. He won Arizona, won Michigan. Now, he won Wyoming yesterday. In fact, he said this is the best week of his life since they lowered the capital gains tax. So exciting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You see, Mitt Romney, I think he's a good man. He just doesn't inspire people. You know? Like, even his new campaign slogan ? 'I guess you're stuck with me.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Rick Santorum; he's not giving up. He's still insisting he is the most conservative candidate. He is the most conservative. Especially on social issues. Oh, my God. The priest who married him was also at his bachelor party. And he left early. He got bored. He said, 'I'm out of here.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

Just regular folks. So he's trying a little too hard. In an interview yesterday, Mitt Romney said that he has worn a garbage bag as rain gear. He said that. He said, 'I have worn a garbage bag as rain gear.' He said it's easy, all he had to do is dump out the hundred dollar bills and throw the bag over his head.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apparently that sweet spot at the intersection of Law Street and Theology Avenue has no stoplight and a five-car pileup is on it and the whole society is very upset about it. It all boils down to this issue of a health insurance mandate that requires employers to provide plans that cover contraception as part of women's preventive healthcare. Some religious groups have said that this violates their principles. Thus, yesterday, and today the United States Senate debated a measure that would only require employers to provide healthcare coverage, quote, 'consistent with their religious beliefs and moral convictions.' It's called the Blunt Amendment, after how high you have to be to think you're going to pass it?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week in Ohio, Mitt Romney has been trying to present himself as a blue collar candidate. Did you hear that? He's trying to connect with regular folk. Unfortunately, it doesn't help that his opening line is, 'Hello, my fellow peasants.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In several of the Super Tuesday states, a third of the voters still believe that President Obama was born in a foreign country. Yeah. These are the same people who think Super Tuesday is Superman's birthday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As of tomorrow, Mitt Romney, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum all get Secret Service protection. Yeah. Meanwhile, Ron Paul will get a can of mace and a rape whistle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, it's Super Tuesday! It's like the Super Bowl of politics, if the Super Bowl was one team slowly destroying itself. And just like the Super Bowl, I have painted my face with my team colors: White.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, I have never liked Attorney General Eric Holder. I can't forgive him for selling out Han Solo to Boba Fett. But he has done one good thing. He signed off on the drone strike that killed jihadist cleric and American citizen Anwar al-Awlaki in Yemen. Now Holder's gotten a lot of criticism for the legal justification he gave for killing an American citizen. None.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When they took out al Awlaki last year, the Obama Justice Department wrote a memo explaining why this action was legal, but then kept the memo secret. ... But yesterday the attorney general explained why it's perfectly legal to execute a citizen without trial. ... Due process does not mean judicial process. The founders weren't picky. I mean trial by jury, trial by fire, rock, paper, scissors -- who cares? Due process just means there's a process that you do. Folks, from what I understand, the current process is apparently, first the President meets with his advisers and decides who he can kill. Then, he kills them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's perfectly legal to blow up al-Awalaki because we are in a declared armed conflict with -- Yemen. Pakistan? Afghanistan? I know it's a stan. I mean, we've got troops in enemy territory. Terror! We're at war with terror! Therefore, the President can blow up any American citizen he chooses until we win the war by defeating the idea of being afraid. You know, as long as calling something a war makes the President judge, jury, and executioner, why don't we let him call in drone strikes in the war on drugs? Or how about the war on poverty? Let's throw the homeless into Gitmo. And I certainly hope the President will use his newly explained authority to carpet bomb the cupcake wars.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For those who still whine that all American citizens must receive judicial process, before they're executed, let's meet them halfway and put judge's robes on our missiles. Because if we're going to win our never-ending war against terror, there are bound to be casualties, and one just happens to be the Constitution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ten states had their big primaries. Everyone says the big money's on Mitt Romney. I mean literally. He's so rich that money oozes from his pores.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Romney spent 5.5 million bucks on TV advertising in the Super Tuesday states. Meanwhile, Ron Paul put a sticker on a light pole.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But my hat's off to Mitt Romney. He's been out on the campaign trail even though he's suffering from a terrible cold. I'm not surprised he's sick.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think much has changed since Super Tuesday. Last night Mitt Romney just barely won the Republican primary in Ohio by 1%. Then Romney made the mistake of saying, 'Ladies and gentlemen, tonight is the victory for the 1%.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to exit polls. Mitt Romney is struggling with voters who call themselves very conservative. However, Mitt is doing great with voters who describe themselves as being totally freaked out by Rick Santorum.&quot;</SPAN></P>

It was reported that in the weeks leading up to his death, Osama bin Laden had trouble controlling the squabbling among his three wives.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Good news for President Obama. The latest polls show President Obama's approval ratings among women have risen by 10%.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, I don't have to tell you, like all Americans, I'm concerned about the rising price of gas. Last weekend I had to cancel my annual lawn fire where I write out my springtime resolutions in gasoline on my lawn. Too bad this year's resolution was going to be to conserve more gas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, whenever I need advice on the oil market I turn to Fox News, home of conservative rising star and Fox News contributor Eric Bolling. He's the lead on Fox News at 5:00 called 'Five,' which is like 'The View' for people who believe 'The View's' panelists are too well informed. Bolling has been pushing a solution to the gas crisis all over Fox News. But he won't tell us what it is. ... That's right. A secret plan in a manila envelope to lower the price of a gallon of gas by $1. What's he got in there? Could it be a dollar? Come on, Bolling, I have to know what's in there. ... What a brilliant plan to get a phone call from the President. You know I want Obama to call me too. Look, sir, President Obama, I've got a plan to eliminate the debt. And I've got a plan to invade and defeat Iran in three days. And I've got-- I've got-- these are the results of some blood tests. And this is some poetry from college. And this, this, this is my plan to organize my manila envelopes. So call me, Mr. President. And all this could be yours.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But in the meantime I have to know what Bolling's plan is. But he said only the President could call. Now of course he didn't specify president of what. I happen to be president of a Super PAC and I am also the president in exile of the Justin Beiber Believer Fan Club. ... You know, screw it, Bolling's plan sounds too important. I am calling. Okay, here we go. Here we go. This is fun. Hello, Eric Bolling, its Barack Obama calling. I'm just here in the Oval Office stroking my pet white person. Thinking of ways to destroy America with contraception. What if we put the Lady Liberty on the pill? Eric Bolling, if you only knew the things that I was planning to do with the oil market. Listen, Eric, I really want these plans you have. I want you to stitch them on to American flag and then burn it. And then I will inhale the vapors and know what your plan is. Seriously, call me. All right, bye.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some conservatives were shocked to hear Robertson wants to legalize marijuana. Mitt Romney was like, 'Bitch said what? Daaaaaammmnnnn.' Yeah, that's how Romney talks. You never see that.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A senior Morgan Stanley banker got arrested for stabbing a taxi driver in the hand during an argument over the cab fare. How weird is that, huh? I mean usually when bankers stab working class people, it's in the back. They don't stab them in the hand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's some very scary news. They say gasoline could be $6 a gallon. But the good news is the White House says President Obama is aware of the problem, and will continue to talk about it between fund-raisers. So that's good. Working on that problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Obama today released his NCAA bracket. He does it every year, you know. He predicts every single game for both the men's and the women's teams. He is a huge basketball fan. But privately, White House aides are worried that he spends so much time on this, it could affect his golf game.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Are you ready for March Madness? ... So there are 68 teams, right? Sixty-eight teams playing for the title. And yet, they'll probably decide a winner before the Republicans do. Isn't that amazing?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, today is Mitt Romney's birthday. Happy birthday to Mitt Romney; 65-years-old. Kind of different at his party, he didn't blow out the candles. He gave a speech and the candles just flickered and died. See, Mitt Romney's birthday is not a big deal here. But in the Cayman Islands, it's a national holiday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think Mitt -- I think he's a good guy. He doesn't really connect, you know, with the Southern voters. Like he thought Mason-Dixon was a hedge fund. He didn't quite understand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for that lovely welcome. That was about as sincere as a Rush Limbaugh apology. How about that Rush Limbaugh? I got to tell you something, it was nice for me to see somebody else apologizing for something for a change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rick Santorum, and who would have thought three months ago that Rick Santorum had a shot at this? I still don't know who the guy is. And he wears the, he doesn't have the sleeves on his shirts. ... We actually endorsed him a couple of weeks because we think he would make the kookiest President. And he's now saying that teleprompters, teleprompters, those are the mechanical devices that allow people to read copy in front of a television camera ... Rick Santorum said teleprompters should be made illegal. I think we'll all sleep a little easier tonight. I remember when I was a kid some punks broke into my house with a teleprompter in the middle of the night and forced me to read the Declaration of Independence. Scary. Thank God they're not going to outlaw cue cards because there would be no show here whatsoever.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is good to have you with us but it is not good to be here. Because as far as I'm concerned it is not show time. Because I refuse to bow to the big government chrono-Nazis and their Daylight Savings Time. No Washington bureaucrat tells me how to adjust to the tilt of the earth's axis. I tell you, folks, this is just Barack Obama stealing an hour of my life to redistribute it to poor people. ... They say you get your hour back in the fall, but who's earning the interest on that hour in the meantime? The unions, that's who. How else do they get those lunch breaks?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, tomorrow are the big GOP primaries in Alabama and Mississippi. That is not just the Deep South, that is Dipped in Batter and Deep Fried South. And everybody knows I'm a loyal son of the South. You can tell by my thick Southern accent. And of course the parasol I carry to protect me from the noon day sun, or else I do declare I will get a brain fever. Now Dixieland has been a Republican bulwark ever since Richard Nixon's Southern Strategy in 1968 when Nixon won by appeal tolling Southern conservatives by stressing states' rights, law and order and a solid pledge to hunt down those Duke boys.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now I like that Rick Santorum even though he's from Pennsylvania. But how can I resist a Georgia peach like Newt Gingrich? He's a Southerner born and raised, except where he was born and raised. And Mitt Romney also exists. And Mitt has just received the glowing endorsement of the preeminent chronicler of Southern culture, the heir to William Faulkner, Mr. Jeff Foxworthy. ... Now if you are a multimillionaire entertainer, supporting the candidacy of a wealthy financier from Massachusetts, you might no longer be a redneck.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;This is interesting ? and stupid. Mostly stupid. A new survey shows that 52% of Republican voters in Mississippi and 45% in Alabama think President Obama is a Muslim. To be fair, the same people also believe it's okay to wear pajama jeans to Wal-Mart so ? Only 12% of those surveyed in those states said they believed Obama is a Christian; 36% said they weren't sure what religion he is. See, this is what happens when your state has fewer schools than Waffle Houses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Mitt Romney celebrated his 65th birthday today. They had to be very careful lighting all those candles around so much hair product. But there were no incidents.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;On Friday, Romney tweeted a link to a playlist, a list of his favorite songs on the music website Spotify. It included songs from Toby Keith, The Beach Boys, Carrie Underwood, two songs from The Killers and the song 'Born Free' by Kid Rock. Can you imagine any scenario in which Mitt Romney puts ear buds in and fires up Kid Rock?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tomorrow morning, President Obama's going to release his bracket. And you knew this was going to happen, Republican leaders have vowed to overturn it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see Mitt Romney try to appeal to the Southern voters? Like, he told folks the other day he had a biscuit and some cheesy grits for breakfast. Yeah, I didn't know they served that at the Ritz Carlton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, there was one awkward moment there for Mitt Romney. They asked if he's ever been to the banks of Mississippi. And he said, 'No. Do they have a better rate than the Cayman Islands?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Believe me, whatever you think, Mitt Romney, this guy is smart with money. He knows how to make money. In fact, turns out, he's had at least 11 money funds and partnerships in low tax foreign countries like Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Switzerland, even Luxembourg. You know what that means? His money has had more foreign policy experience than he has.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new poll 45% of American children between the ages of 5 and 13 cannot tie their own shoelaces. Isn't that unbelievable? You think we're behind China now? Not only do kids in China tie their shoelaces, they actually make the shoes, okay? That's the difference right there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You all know Newt Gingrich. You know who I'm talking about when I say Newt Gingrich. Newt is short for Newton. People say if that's the case, what is Mitt short for? It's short for Mittens. Newt Gingrich is searching now, he's so confident he'll be the presidential candidate he's looking for a vice presidential running mate. Being Newt Gingrich's vice presidential running mate is like being a Kim Kardashian husband.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;President Obama was at one of the play-in games at Dayton, Ohio, tonight. He brought British Prime Minister, David Cameron, with him. It's part of a cultural exchange program. They go to a basketball game here in America. And then, in July, the Prime Minister has invited Obama to England to take part in a soccer riot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;There were a number of Republican primaries today, in Alabama, Mississippi, Hawaii, and American Samoa. I knew Samoa had their own Girl Scout cookie but I didn't realize they were voting now too. Good for them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;It was very close in the South. Romney and Santorum and Gingrich were neck and neck and double-chin all night long. Mitt Romney continues to have trouble relating to regular people. Someone asked him if he was a fan of NASCAR a few weeks ago. And he said he had several friends who were NASCAR team owners. And when asked about Peyton Manning yesterday, Romney said he has NFL team owners. He knows a lot of owners. You know how some of the candidates seem like the kind of guy you can have a beer with? Mitt Romney's the kind of guy you can buy a brewery with.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Rick Santorum yesterday spoke at what they call the Gulf Coast Energy Summit, in Biloxi, Mississippi. And he said, he believes global warming is bogus. And when Rick Santorum speaks about climate science, you listen. Because as you can see here, he looks a lot like a local weather man. Thanks, Rick. Now, here's Newt with sports.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, let's see what's going on. President Obama announced his Final Four. They are Kentucky, Ohio State, Missouri, and North Carolina. And Mitt Romney announced his Final Four. Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, Exxon, and the Cayman Islands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, congratulations to Rick Santorum on winning the Mississippi and Alabama primaries. Newt Gingrich finished second. Mitt Romney finished third. Ron Paul still finishing his cornflakes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the good news for Mitt Romney, he doesn't have to pretend to like grits anymore. ... See, Mitt Romney keeps making that same mistake where he tries to connect with ordinary people. But he comes off like a rich guy. Like when he was talking about football the other day. Did you hear that story? He said, 'I happen to be good friends with the owners of the Dolphins and the Jets.' And then he told a hilarious story about how his TV once went dead in the middle of the Super Bowl because his yacht was too far from the shore. And then there was the time he ran out of brie cheese. He keeps putting his wingtips in his mouth. That's his problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, Mitt Romney's been outspending his opponents by a huge margin, and he's still losing. Fortunately, being a hedge fund manager, he bet against himself and made another fortune. So it all worked out. It all worked out okay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Newt Gingrich has promised to cut the price of gas to $2.50 a gallon. It's not catching on with voters. See, here's my question, how bad a candidate are you that people are willing to pay higher gas prices just to keep you out of office? You know, we'll go with the six bucks. It's fine. We got it covered.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, not a good week for President Obama either. His approval rating has dropped 9% in the last month. An all time low of 41%. It was 57% last May. In fact, if this keeps up, the White House said they may have to fish out bin Laden and shoot him all over again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, a new CBS poll found that 80% of Americans say they are not better off than they were four years ago. The other 20% own gas stations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Mitt Romney, by the way, loves St. Patrick's Day. Always dresses in green on St. Patrick's Day. He wears his money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top Ten Other Phrases Never Before Said By Mitt Romney:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. Where my pimps at?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Ah, that's enough hair gel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. This brisket is so good I could plotz.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Man, 'The Late Show' is hilarious tonight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Let's scour Craigslist for some free couches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. I try to eat some cold cereal at the end of the day and a full tummy, and a long day puts me to bed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. We can't lay people off, it's Christmas!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. I think the dog would be more comfortable inside the car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Only if you insist, I'll sing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Tell the chef not to bother warming my nuts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So did Newt win the South? Well, actually Rick Santorum won Alabama and Mississippi, and Mitt Romney won Hawaii and American Samoa. Here's a little mnemonic device to help you remember. Places you can get to in a Winnebago go to Santorum. Places that require a jet or a yacht go to Romney. Romney always does well with islands. That's where his money lives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So Gingrich did not get the thing that he had to have, thus dooming his once-promising campaign. His humble concession last night was hallmark of American... Oh, [bleep] he's acting like he won! [As Gingrich] 'These are some of the nation's brightest minds who can't figure out why I, Newt Gingrich, won't quit.' Was it a promise to a sick child? Was he told by a wizard if he doesn't stay in the presidential race the world will fall into darkness? Is Newt's campaign some kind of Joaquin Phoenix performance art that, I don't know, we'll eventually get but still not like or think was not that funny?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But you [Gingrich] don't get to add Santorum's sum to yours to make it sound impressive. You know, between me and Lebron James last night, we scored 36 points. That's not your total! And you know if you add Romney's delegates to mine, I've actually won.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Alabama and Mississippi primaries were last night and the stakes for Romney were high or as Mitt would say, just the right height. Because if he won either state he could dispel doubts about his appeal to conservatives and I would have to start loving him, which of course I have to do as long as I have no other choice. But I do because after a week of candidates forcing cheesy grits down their throats and 'y'alls' out of their throats the Deep South has spoken and for once the nation could understand what they were saying.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is great. The Democrats had the same situation when they won last time in 2008. Now Republicans get that Hillary versus Obama magic minus any women or black people or magic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Last night was a big night for Rick Santorum. He won primary elections in both Mississippi and Alabama. Mitt Romney, who was the front-runner, came in third in those states. Which is weird, normally the South is very welcoming to wealthy Northerners. All the candidates insist they will stay in the race until the convention this summer. However, today, the American people announced they are dropping out of the race. We've had it. We've had it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Obama said he's set up a task force to look into high gas prices. Now, he'd look into it himself, but he's busy working on those brackets. That takes a long time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And although Rick Santorum was the big winner in Alabama and Mississippi, Mitt Romney won caucuses in Hawaii and American Samoa. So it's nice to see him doing well in islands other than the Caymans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney's whole problem when he was down there, he was trying to pass himself off as a regular guy. And you can't fool Southerners. They know. Like when Romney went to the Cracker Barrel for lunch, he asked to see the wine list. You see? You don't do that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll tell you, this Romney guy is rich. He's really rich. His idea of a po' boy sandwich is a sandwich being eaten by someone who makes under half a million dollars a year. He is so rich, when he flies, his wallet counts as a carry-on bag. He has to pay extra. Mitt Romney is so rich, at his house; his doggie door has a doorman. That's how rich. He is so rich, his gardener is Martha Stewart. In fact, he is so rich, you know the little polo player on the corner of his shirts? That's him. That's actually him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And more and more Republicans are calling on Newt Gingrich to drop out of the campaign. Well, I don't want the say things look bad for Newt, but his ex-wives now are starting to outnumber his supporters. Okay, that's never a good sign. Never a good sign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Rick Santorum, he announced today Puerto Ricans need to speak English before they can become a state. You can't be a state if you don't speak English? We are so screwed here in California.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rick Santorum says if elected President, he'll crack down on Internet porn. This could cost hundreds of California teachers their moonlighting jobs. Crack down on Internet porn? You thought he was alienating female voters with that birth control thing? Oh, guys are going to be leaving in droves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Tuesday, Mitt dominated the primaries in Hawaii and American Samoa after previously winning in the Marianas Islands and Guam. No surprise Mitt does well in the Pacific. The natives mistake him for an Easter Island head.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Rick Santorum got a little taste of spring break in Puerto Rico yesterday. He was there campaigning for the Republican primary that takes place on Sunday. He was happy to be in the warm climate. In fact, instead of his sweater vest, he was wearing a sweater bikini.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Puerto Rico is a territory of the United States. And yesterday, Santorum greeted the locals by telling them if Puerto Rico wants to become a state, they need to start speaking English. Like Jesus does. Only Rick Santorum would go to someone's native land and tell them they're speaking the wrong language. And then he told them to stop being so Mexican. He got a shot to be our funniest President ever.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what's kind of ironic? This will be the fourth St. Patrick's Day of Obama's presidency. He still hasn't created a green job.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the government, President Obama's Obamacare is going to cost twice as much as he said it would originally. He said it would cost $900 billion. But now, it's up to something like $1.7 trillion. What's the good news for President Obama? When it comes to math skills, our country is ranked 30th in the world. So nobody will notice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see President Obama filling out his NCAA March Madness brackets? ... He picked the Tar Heels. Then he did the women's bracket. He went with Baylor on that one. Then, I think, he got a little out of control. He loves doing these brackets. ... He's doing the sexiest man alive. Then he's doing the National Dog Show. Here's the one that surprised me. 'Toddlers and Tiaras.' He's picking McKenzie again. He's picking McKenzie again this year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Mitt Romney's still trying to change his image as an out of touch rich guy. I don't think it's working. You see what he did today? He took the silver spoon he was born with out of his mouth, had it bronzed. You know, tone it down a little bit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And make no mistake, Mitt Romney's a rich guy. He is so rich, even his illegal immigrants have illegal immigrants working for them. That's how rich. He is so rich, the last time he went hunting; he shot Dick Cheney in the face. Okay, that is rich. He is so rich, in his fantasy football league, he drafts owners. That's how rich.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's my favorite political thing of the week. Rick Santorum announced this week that if he is elected President of the United States, he will crack down and end Internet pornography. He will end pornography in this country. His slogan, 'Just Say No to Yourself.' ... End pornography? Well, you thought guys fought hard to keep their guns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich made his final public appearance yesterday, before beginning his 14-year prison term. No word on who his cellmate is yet. It's probably a good chance it's another former Illinois governor. I'm sure it is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And drug users in San Francisco have formed a drug users union. This is real. Let me tell you something. If there's any way these crystal meth addicts can get a better dental plan, I'm all for it, okay? I can't look at those teeth on 'Cops.' Now, how does that work? If you're in the drug users union, and you pass the drug test, do they kick you out? How does that work?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, President Obama's approval rating has fallen to a new low. That's not good. Unemployment still too high. Gas prices skyrocketing. But the good news to the President? His brackets are looking great.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, congratulations to Mitt Romney. He won the Republican primary in Puerto Rico. Did you know this? Under the commonwealth status, Puerto Ricans pay no Federal income tax. So Mitt felt right at home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And after Romney won in Puerto Rico, he celebrated his victory by having his favorite, blueberry pancakes. Which surprised me. I mean, Romney always seemed like a waffle guy, didn't he?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rick Santorum, he lost big in Puerto Rico. A lot of people blamed it on the fact that he said Puerto Ricans need to speak English before they become a state. That's what he said, yeah. Speak English before you can become a state? Hey, California doesn't even require you to speak English before you become governor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Rick Santorum says he wants to fight a war on pornography. Well, you thought the war on drugs was hopeless. Oh, my God.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the latest poll shows that Mitt Romney does best among voters who make over $100,000 a year. Or as Mitt calls them, 'the working poor.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, he [Romney] is rich. He is a rich guy. He is so rich, his birdbath has a bidet. That's how rich. Mitt Romney is so rich; he taught his dog to roll over an IRA. That's how rich. He so is rich, he believes in waterboarding terrorists with Perrier. That's how rich. He is so rich, the hood ornament on his car is a Mini Cooper.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Office of Homeland Security has put out a new list of suspicious activities that TSA agents say you should look out for in travelers.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Beautiful day today. Wasn't it a lovely day? Here's how nice it was on the Eastern Seaboard. It's such a beautiful day today that Mitt Romney was riding on the roof of his car.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm very excited because the First Lady, Michelle Obama is with us this evening. And we're very proud, very happy to have her here. And whenever we have somebody of this importance, you get the Secret Service. And these guys don't like me. But let me just tell you something. Today security in this place is tighter than Chris Christie's pants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you know they have presidential primaries in Puerto Rico? I didn't know that. But they do. And you know who won? Mitt won in Puerto Rico. And I said really? They don't know Mitt in Puerto Rico, do they? I said let me see the ballot. And so here's the Puerto Rican ballot. There, now look at this: El Loco, El Muy Loco, El Gordo, Mitt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(pointing out various audience members) &quot;Top Ten Things The Secret Service Learned About Tonight's Audience:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rick Santorum has now said if elected President, he would ban hard core pornography. Which is why Mitt Romney changed his slogan, 'Mitt Romney: Because Santorum Would Ban Hard Core Pornography.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of Rick Santorum, a racy photo of a shirtless Rick Santorum lounging in a pool is circulating on the internet right now. Ironically, the photo has proven to be a very effective form of birth control. Santorum has mixed feelings about that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new report that says not long before Osama bin Laden died he really wanted to change al Qaeda's name to help its image. He wanted to change the name Al Qaeda to help their image, yeah. Unfortunately, Pink Berry was taken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During President Obama's stop at an Irish pub on Saint Patrick's Day, someone asked him to sign their face. Yeah, Obama was like, 'Now's not the best time, Biden. I mean really, get it together. No more jaeger bombs for him.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday on CNN Rick Santorum promised to crack down on pornography if he becomes President. Which explains why Rick Santorum's approval rating just went down by six inches.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to a new book coming out called 'Showdown,' President Obama blames Fox News for his political problems and losing voters. Now, come on. How could Fox News lose voters? If you're watching Fox News, you're probably not voting for him in the first place.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Rick Santorum has declared war on pornography. ... Really, stopping pornography? Why not aim for something more realistic like stopping the rain in Seattle. Something doable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the candidates are choosing their Secret Service code names. Rick Santorum chose the name Petrus after his grandfather. And Mitt Romney, you can tell he's a rich guy. You see his name Secret Service code name? Thurston Howell III.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He is so rich -- today, Mitt Romney was driving around with his butler strapped to the roof of his car. That's how rich. He is so rich, every Christmas when he watches 'It's a Wonderful Life,' he cheers for Mr. Potter. ... He is so rich he goes through Rodeo Drive just to see how regular people shop. That's how rich.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rick Santorum said he's not worried about unemployment. Well, he will be in November.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody is talking about the 2012 presidential election. In fact, just last week, a tourist in Puerto Rico took a picture of Rick Santorum, shirtless on the beach. He did. I don't want to say he looked chubby, but his new Secret Service code name is 'Newt Gingrich.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rick Santorum was seen lying on the beach without his shirt on. He would have worn sunscreen but, you know, he's not really into protection.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;You know, they had a GOP primary election today in Illinois. Mitt Romney was projected to win big considering the fact that he owns the state of Illinois. Romney had a big victory, finishing with about 50% of the vote. Rick Santorum finished with 35% of the vote. Newt Gingrich finished behind Ron Paul with only about 8%. Some top Republicans are urging Newt to leave the race, but he says he's sticking around. If they could get him to marry the race, he would probably leave it eventually.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;This is an interesting presidential detail. Everyone who's protected by the Secret Service gets a code name and that includes the major candidates for President. An article has revealed the code names for Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum. Romney's code name is Javelin, after the stick he has up his butt, I think. Santorum's code name is Petrus, which means Peter. They get to choose these themselves. If you had the chance to have a Secret Service code name, wouldn't you make it something cool, like Bonesaw, or something? Instead, Javelin and Petrus. My code name would be Superman. That way they would be forced to say, 'Superman has entered the Pancake Shack.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rick Santorum is still hanging in there. It's interesting, it's been reported the Santorum campaign has raised at least $300,000 by selling sweater vests. Yeah. Meanwhile, the Newt Gingrich campaign has made twice that by selling Spanx for men.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some big news out of the White House. This weekend, President Obama will visit the border that separates North and South Korea. And not to be outdone, Newt Gingrich will visit the border that separates the KFC from the Taco Bell.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, this is a true story about Mitt Romney. You guys know there's a robot running for President, right? While touring Google's offices yesterday, this is a true story, Romney saw a lava lamp on someone's desk and said, 'That's a big lava lamp. Congratulations.'

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's a story that won't go away. Former Senator and presidential candidate, John Edwards, remember him? John Edwards. Well, the New York papers are now saying that Edwards allegedly used the services of a Manhattan call girl ... while he was running for President. Was hiring prostitutes while he was running for President. But, Edwards vigorously denies it. Who are you going to believe? A whore who will do or say anything? Or this woman?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, all the candidates are now choosing their Secret Service code names. Why do they tell us? You think that should be secret, but Mitt Romney's picked Javelin. That's his real Secret Service code name, Javelin. Rick Santorum chose Petrus 'cause that's his grandfather's name. Barack Obama chose Gas Prices Are Not My Fault. That's his Secret Service code name.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, at the White House this week, President Obama and the First Lady hosted a St. Patrick's day reception for the Irish Prime Minister. Even the bartender pouring green beer. Which is about as close as the White House has come to creating green jobs so far.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's some news from the campaign trail. During a speech yesterday President Obama said that he won't mention the GOP candidates by name. Yeah. So instead he's calling them Robot, Geezer, Nerd and Lard-Ass.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You guys hear about this? There are reports that John Edwards visited a brothel here in New York while running for President and paid with campaign funds. Man, do you realize what this could do to his reputation? Absolutely nothing. Absolutely nothing to that man's reputation. Good Lord. What a turkey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;March Madness started again today with the start of the round known as the Sweet 16. I have already been eliminated from our office pool. I made a dumb mistake. My bracket sheet, instead of circling the teams I thought were going to win, I poured gravy all over it and ate it. Which is like automatic disqualification. President Obama is doing very well with his picks. His bracket was in the top 2% of everyone who makes picks on ESPN.com. I guess it helps when you can send the CIA in to scout the teams, but he's ahead of almost 6 million people. He did this last year, too. Once again, President Obama is out of touch with regular hard working Americans who don't know how to bet on college basketball.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Mitt Romney's senior campaign adviser was asked during an interview with CNN if the conservative stances that Romney has taken during the Republican primary would hurt him with moderates in the general election and he said, this is a quote, 'I think you hit a reset button for the fall campaign. It's almost like an Etch-a-Sketch. You can shake it up and start all over again.' Of course, that does not help with the perception that Romney's changed his political views to help him win. In fact, it hurts. Romney was so upset, last night; he didn't even iron his Dockers before he went to bed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Newt Gingrich pounced on this. He brought an Etch-A-Sketch out during a campaign appearance yesterday. He said, 'You have to stand for something that lasts longer than this.' Which, I'm sure his ex-wives got a good laugh at that one.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is so huge! 'The Hunger Games.' oh, my God. It's a big movie. The movie is based on -- you know the books, right? The books where people are chosen in a lottery to compete in a televised battle to the death. See, why can't we do this to the Republican primaries?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Mitt Romney got a big endorsement this week. The bad news, it was from Etch-a-Sketch. And Jeb Bush, Jeb Bush has come out and endorsed Mitt Romney. He said it was the hardest decision he's had to make since endorsing his brother, George W.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, despite Mitt Romney's 14-point lead nationwide, Rick Santorum is projected to win Louisiana's primary tomorrow. Even worse for Mitt? Listen to this; the Saints have put a bounty out on him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is kind of nice, did you see the story on the news about the mother duck and her ducklings were helped through a fence at the White House property? The mother duck got through, but the little ducklings, the Secret Service pushed the little ducks through the fence. You know, letting them on the property. Yeah, of course, the Secret Service checked to make sure that the ducks had donated enough money to President Obama's re-election campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Researchers at the University of Manchester say that enhanced cleavage from a push-up bra can make you feel 75% more confident. That's why Newt Gingrich hasn't dropped out. He feels more confident now!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And former Senator John 'The John' Edwards now denying that he was a client of the millionaire madam in New York City. His lawyers called the report false and defamatory. Which of course, is lawyer talk for true and accurate. No Edwards, he denies it. Edwards says he never paid prostitutes for sex. That's what campaign workers are for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, a new census report shows that one in six Americans are now Hispanic. The other five are also Hispanic. Just not Americans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm so excited for tonight's show. But if it doesn't go well, don't worry. We'll just shake it up and start over like an Etch-a-Sketch. Did you hear about that thing though? Mitt Romney's adviser actually compared him to an Etch-a-Sketch and because of that Etch-a-Sketch's sales jumped 1500%. True. Or as Disney put it, 'Any way you can compare Romney to a ticket to 'John Carter?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier this week, Secret Service agents helped a group of ducklings over the White House fence where the mother duck was waiting. Of course, while they were doing that, someone stole Air Force One.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this weekend, 71-year-old former Vice President Dick Cheney received a heart transplant. And I thought this was nice. They let him shoot the donor himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former Vice President Dick Cheney has a brand-new heart, ladies and gentlemen. He got himself a heart transplant. The donor heart came from a traveling peasant, who lost his way in the middle of the night and ended up at Cheney's castle. Doctors say can he could live long enough to shoot another hunting buddy in the face.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, former Vice President Dick Cheney received a heart transplant. The new heart is working so well that Cheney has already gone to Whoville and returned all of their Christmas presents.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rick Santorum caused a little bit of a stir. He swore at a reporter the other day. ... Rick Santorum said you aren't a real Republican until you have sworn at someone from the 'New York times.' Moments later, a panicked Mitt Romney called the 'New York Times' reception desk and said 'Heck!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The 2012 election is pretty nasty. It's getting pretty nasty out there. Yesterday on CNN, White House advisor David Plouffe referred to the Republican presidential race as a 'clown show.' Romney, Santorum, Paul, and Gingrich all called the statement ridiculous. And then they piled into one tiny car and drove off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dick Cheney received a heart transplant this weekend, after waiting for two years. He wasn't waiting for a donor. It just took doctors two years to find Cheney's current heart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama yesterday said that North Korea is in a time warp that has missed 50 years of progress. North Korea denied the accusation, in a strongly-worded telegraph.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The headline is Dick Cheney got a new heart. I'm sure by the way that there is a very different headline in the organ community. Probably something like 'Innocent Heart Sentenced to Life in Cheney.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Congratulations are in order for former Vice President Dick Cheney, who was the lucky recipient of a new heart over the weekend. The operation was a success, despite fears that his body would reject the new heart because it wasn't sufficiently evil. There's a question as to whether he was given special treatment, but I guess he had been on the wait list for 20 months. If this was a TV movie, they would have given him the heart of an Occupy Wall Street protester, preferably a gay one. Wouldn't that be poetic? He sees a commercial for 'Mamma Mia' on Broadway and it just starts to pound and he doesn't know why. According to his doctor, the recovery is going well and he'll be up and shooting people in three weeks.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Supreme Court is debating President Obama's Obamacare today and whether or not the government has overstepped its bounds. Justice Scalia asked an interesting question. He said, 'If the government can force you to buy health insurance, can they also force you to buy other things like gym memberships, funeral insurance or broccoli?' See, how American are those worst-case scenarios? Those are the worst things for Americans -- joining a gym, dying or eating broccoli.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, we have Mitt Romney on this show tonight. We have to be nice to Mitt. He could be our next President. NBC is still hoping for a government bailout.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, we were going to try and book Rick Santorum, but the censors said he just works too dirty. Just swears too much. Did you see Santorum lose it the other day? He had a heated exchange with a 'New York Times' reporter, cursing the guy out. He's really cursing the guy. Given how mad he was that day, Santorum said he wished the reporter's parents had used birth control.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Newt Gingrich has begun charging $50 to have your picture taken with him at campaign events. You know, he's just one primary loss away from people charging him $50.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday was Nancy Pelosi's birthday. They had a huge surprise party for her. Actually, it was a regular party. She just always looks surprised.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday, while in South Korea, President Obama looked through a pair of binoculars into North Korea. He said it was like looking through a time warp and seeing a world that is 50 years behind everyone else. It was like walking into a Blockbuster Video store. 'VHS tapes!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Osama bin Laden's family has been charged with being in the country of Pakistan illegally. But their lawyer says they were just there willing to do the terrorist jobs the Pakistanis didn't want to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A madam in New York city claims that John Edwards was a customer in her brothel. You know, you hear that kind of thing and it really makes you lose respect for prostitutes, doesn't it? In fact, this might be the first time where the hooker is more embarrassed about being caught than the john.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, you know Dick Cheney? He's had like five heart attacks and he's had a history of heart troubles. ... Well, over the weekend they gave him the heart transplant. Got a heart transplant and I said well, 'You know what? Finally all of those midnight trips to the graveyard with the hunchbacked assistant have paid off.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Cheney was talking to a reporter right after the surgery and he says he wants to live long enough to make sure nobody else gets healthcare. That's his goal. And he said 'Before I die, I would like to shoot just one more hunting buddy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top Ten Questions To Ask Yourself Before Spending $50 On A Photo With Newt Gingrich:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. How much have I paid for pictures with other guys named Newt?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Should I just photograph myself burning $50?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Do I look Newty enough?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Should I just get a free photo of some other guy who's not going to be President?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Do I have to touch him?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Is this how Newt met his three wives?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Seriously, have I lost my mind?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Does Newt have to be in the photo?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. What would Rick Santorum think of this idea?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Will Rush Limbaugh think I'm a slut?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Newt Gingrich's campaign having a little money trouble. Have you heard about this? Newt Gingrich's campaign is charging people $50 to pose for a picture with Newt. Yeah. And for $100 you can get one without Newt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Supreme Court is deciding right now whether the government can mandate that all Americans buy health insurance. Have you heard this? Rick Santorum said, 'There's no way I'm letting the government make me go on a man date.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rick Santorum, a conservative, swearing at a reporter. I think this is how he should talk from now on. 'I believe life begins at [bleep] conception. You got a problem with that [bleep]?' ... I think the real Santorum might be more bad ass than we realize. He looks all milquetoasty in the sweater vests but I think they started out as sweaters and he rips the arms off!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to take a minute here to send best wishes to former Vice President Dick Cheney, who is recovering after receiving a heart transplant on Saturday. Sir, hope you're back on your feet soon. Or maybe somebody else's younger, stronger feet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Newt Gingrich is hoping to cut into his campaign debt by charging people $50 to take a photo with him. Just imagine, a once in a lifetime opportunity to get a personal picture with a man who will never be the President of the United States. I would pay the 50 bucks if he agreed to wear a prom dress in the photo. For $50, you get a nice formal portrait. For a hundred dollars he'll eat pellets out of your hand like a llama.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;AAA said today that the gas prices are expected to continue to rise throughout the summer, and oil companies say it's because of high demand due to warmer summer weather. As opposed to what they told us a couple of months ago. Oil prices went up because of higher demand for winter heating oil. So basically, if there's weather, gas prices go up. If there's any weather of any kind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this week, the Supreme Court is hearing arguments against Obamacare. How ironic is that? Did you see the Supreme Court sitting there in those black robes, huh? Don't they look like a death panel?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Newt Gingrich announced today he is laying off a third of his campaign staff. Is that surprising? Hey, he laid off two-thirds of his wives. Why is that unusual?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And how desperate is this? Newt Gingrich has started charging supporters $50 each to have a picture taken with him. 50 bucks to take a picture? Well, that's what it costs now. You wait another week or two? He'll be on Hollywood Boulevard with Spongebob and Jack Sparrow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dick Cheney had a heart transplant on Saturday. He is doing well. Believe me, that surgery was a big deal. 'Cause this is Cheney's first heart, you know. Apparently, he was up all night. 'What's that beating sound? What is that?' In fact, right after he got the new heart, he got a call from President Bush who asked if the Wizard could get him a brain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, best wishes going out to Dick Cheney, former Vice President, Dick Cheney over the weekend had a heart transplant. He's doing just fine, but you know what? The Dominoes guy is missing. Cheney's recuperating. He's at home. A nice house, beautiful view over the village square where he can take a look at the peasants with their torches.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Supreme Court, they're hearing arguments right now about the constitutionality of the healthcare, the Obama healthcare plan. Here's all I care about. Will the healthcare plan, will it cover my facelifts?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney was a guest on 'The Tonight Show' over there on NBC. I mean, it's interesting, you know, you have an empty suit trying to please everyone, and then Romney comes out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ron Paul said it's too early to count him out as the Republican nominee. Seriously? That's like Newt Gingrich saying it's too early to count him out as an Abercrombie model. It's not gonna happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The jackpot for the mega millions lottery has reached a record $500 million. Or as Mitt Romney calls that, one more beach house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight we have something big to celebrate ? Obamacare is dead. It was killed by nine people in black robes. I told you there would be death panels. You lose, Mr. President. Take Obamacare and stick it where the sun don't shine. Then have it removed by eye doctor you have to pay yourself because he's not in-network.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, the lynchpin of this legislative 'Obamanation', is the healthcare mandate. And it's not the good kind of mandate where two buddies play racquetball together and recharge over burgers, booze, and a long steam with zero sexual tension. ... No, this mandate requires all Americans to buy health insurance, and, folks, this Supreme Court battle over health insurance is the biggest case since Scopes defeated that monkey. I can't remember what that case was about. I think the monkey bit someone. The point is, the monkey in this case was the solicitor general arguing in favor of Obamacare, and, boy, did he bruise his banana.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this mega millions lottery jackpot is now over half a billion dollars. Billion. That is so much money, I saw Mitt Romney buying a lotto ticket. That's a lot of money. What do you think your odds are of winning that? The last odds I checked, 176 million to one. But then again, still better odds than Newt Gingrich getting the nomination.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You see what Newt Gingrich is doing now to raise money? He's selling pictures of himself. You can get your picture taken with Newt Gingrich for $50. $50. What's next? Traveling around the country wrestling alligators shirtless for 25 bucks?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to a new CNN poll, the majority of Republicans want Newt Gingrich and Ron Paul to drop out of the race. You know, we had a poll like that. It was called the primaries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Supreme Court continued to debate President Obama's Obamacare. It doesn't look good. The Supreme Court thinks the government may have overstepped its bounds. You know, I think we would save money by scrapping Obamacare, letting every American get their check-up as you go through airport security. You're already getting an x-ray. They're touching you. All you got to do is bend over and cough. There's a physical. There's the whole physical.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think even President Obama realizes the Obamacare thing is not looking good in front of the Supreme Court. He's starting to downplay it. Like, today, he called it Bidencare.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many right-wing Republicans are upset by reports that the actress and ultraliberal Jane Fonda is gonna portray Nancy Reagan in an upcoming movie. Jane Fonda playing Nancy Reagan. A liberal acting like a Republican. So maybe there's a part for Mitt Romney in this movie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now here's something to put in the back of your head when are you going to your polling place if Rick Santorum gets the nomination. He's bowling in Wisconsin, which is fine; I have no problem with either of those. Wisconsin I love, it's the cheese land. And bowling, you can't go wrong with bowling. So they're up there bowling and a little kid is bowling and he picked up a pink ball. And Rick Santorum says to the kid 'Oh no, son, don't use the pink ball, it's not manly.' That's what Rick Santorum says to the kid -- this coming from a guy in a sweater vest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just between you and me Newt Gingrich is broke. Got no money. Yup, how you can run a campaign for anything if you have no money? Money is the backbone of the American political system. You got to have money. ... He keeps firing campaign workers; Newt Gingrich keeps laying them off. And he's trying to run a national campaign for President. He laid-off his entire Canadian office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top Ten Other Things Rick Santorum Thinks Are Bull [bleep]:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fascinating rumor on the campaign trail. It's been reported that Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich had a secret meeting. Yeah.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney, this guy has trouble connecting with the common man. Yesterday, Mitt Romney told what he thought was a humorous story about how his father closed down a Michigan factory. Yeah, then Romney went on to quote some of his favorite quotes from the movie 'Schindler's List.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new poll found that President Obama's approval rating is above 50% for the first time since last May. Obama made sure to thank the people who made that possible. Mitt Romney, Rick Santorum, Newt Gingrich and Ron Paul.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of the election, today Rick Santorum gave a speech at the Jelly Belly factory in California. Incidentally, the Jelly Belly Factory was also Newt Gingrich's name in college.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A recent survey showed that Rick Santorum is the favorite GOP candidate among Republican women. When he heard that, Santorum was like, 'Wait, women have the right to vote?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday Mitt Romney told Wisconsin voters that he had a humorous story, which ended up being about his father shutting down a factory.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess Mitt Romney's staff played an April Fools' joke on him. They told him there was a run on banks in the Cayman Islands. Oh, you should've seen his face. No, this is true. I guess his staff played a practical joke on him yesterday. They sent him out to give a speech in a room that was completely empty. He got there the room was completely empty. Oddly enough the audience reaction was the same as if the room had been completely full. So, it didn't really make any difference.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, plans have been announced for another sequel to 'The Hangover.' This one takes place at the big GSA conference in Las Vegas. You know this story? Oh, here's your tax dollars at work. This is what makes people furious. The head of the GSA, a woman named Martha Johnson, has resigned after they found out she spent over $830,000 on a four-day government conference in Las Vegas. And the President is furious. Not President Obama, the President of China. It's his money. It's his money she spent. They're starting to investigate how all this money got wasted. Turns out they had eight scouting trips to Las Vegas to make sure everything was set up right. Eight scouting trips to Vegas. How naive is the White House? They bought a cover story no wife in America would ever believe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that she thinks it's time for Syrian President Assad to go. She said the sooner he leaves the better.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You all excited about the big Wisconsin primary, huh? ... Primary number 88 in that state I don't care about. A little bit of a controversy going on with the Wisconsin primary. Wisconsin Democrats are accusing Mitt Romney of handing out free sub sandwiches in exchange for votes. Which explains why Newt Gingrich today voted for Mitt Romney. Seven times.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here is the latest news from the campaign trail. Today Mitt Romney handed out turkey subs to voters before the Wisconsin primary. Which explains Romney's newest supporter, Newt Gingrich. He's excited about that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of the election, yesterday Rick Santorum guaranteed that he will win the primary in his home state of Pennsylvania. And not to be outdone, Ron Paul guaranteed he will finish somewhere in the top ten.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some TV news this morning. On the 'Today Show' Sarah Palin took part in a panel that discussed hot topics. Not to be outdone, Newt Gingrich took part in a panel that discussed Hot Pockets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;More primary elections were held in Wisconsin, Maryland, and Washington, DC today.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Most experts believe this was Rick Santorum's last chance for the nomination.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, congratulations to Mitt Romney. Mitt Romney, the big winner in yesterday's primary. He won in Wisconsin. Santorum came in second. Newt Gingrich came in fourth behind Ron Paul. But Wisconsin was not a total loss for Newt. He did make off with a 45-pound wheel of cheese, so he's got that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republicans are now starting to accept the fact that Mitt Romney will be their nominee for President, but, you know, they're not that excited about it. It's kind of like starting to accept that you're going to the prom with your sister.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear that story about how Mitt Romney and his wife are going to put a car elevator in their San Diego home? Did you hear that? A car elevator.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Supreme Court has ruled that anybody can be strip-searched for any kind of arrest. That's something to think about next time you bring 12 items into the ten items or less lane.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin co-hosted the 'Today' show the other day. Isn't that amazing? I mean four years ago, she almost co-hosted the entire country. Actually she did a pretty good job, and they want to bring her back for a new version of 'Where in the World is Matt Lauer?' What they're going to do is release Matt into Central Park, and Sarah will track him down 'Hunger Games' style.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People think Mitt Romney has enough delegates to get the nomination. ... What he needs is a game changer of a vice presidential candidate. That's what they say he needs. Got everything all lined up, all of the delegates. A game change for Vice President. I thought, 'Well, my God, that sure worked great four years ago.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who's hosting the 'Today' show on NBC? Yesterday morning? Sarah Palin. Half-term governor from Alaska and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin was the host of the 'Today' show. Do you watch the 'Today' show? I'll tell you something right now. You know my favorite segment on the 'Today' show is this thing 'Where in the World is the Remote Control?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Romney and Obama, we're still in the primaries but it feels like the general election has already broken out. They're already exchanging barbs, these two. Yesterday, President Obama accused the Republicans of social Darwinism. And today Romney accused the President of rhetorical excess. When asked to comment, former President Bush said, 'What?' And they gave him ice cream and he was fine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of President Obama, recently at the White House, President Obama admitted he's a trekkie. Although trekkies say he doesn't qualify because he has a wife and a job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain said an interesting thing. This morning, John McCain was asked who Mitt Romney should consider for Vice President. McCain laughed and said, 'Sarah Palin.' When no one else laughed, McCain sighed, stared into the distance and said, 'I guess you had to be there.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some big election news, you guys. Last night, Mitt Romney went three-for-three by winning the primaries in Maryland, Wisconsin and Washington, DC. Not to be outdone, Rick Santorum went three-for-three by offending women, atheists and Latinos.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We won a Peabody! Folks, thank you. I am so happy to finally have a second one. Now my Peabodys and my Emmys can double date. Folks, this highly prestigious award is bestowed on the greatest shows in radio and television and it's my favorite award to win because it is determined by one criterion: Excellence! But unlike most things, this isn't just about me. I want to thank everyone on the show for all their hard work and the staff of my Super PAC who, thanks to the FEC rules, are allowed to be the same people. And a huge shout-out to my Super PAC advisors Trevor Potter and Ham Rove. Ham, just for this you are going to survive another Easter dinner. Trevor, no promises. And I share this award with the members of the Supreme Court whose Citizens United ruling made it possible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, we have finally achieved a national groundswell of Mitt-thusiasm and we must unite behind one candidate so we can plummet toward victory in November. Now, is Mitt the best candidate? No. Is he the true conservative candidate? Nah-uh. But he is the most candidate. And I believe with some of my heart that now more than ever someone should run. And it appears that Mitt is. Therefore, the next President of the United States must be-- anybody else jumping in? No. Did you check? Last chance. Okay. Mitt Romney! Whoo! All right, that's enough. That's enough. I'm sure that will feel better next time I have to say it. But now Romney has to do something that does not come naturally to him-- appeal to voters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Romney has such Latino appeal that according to a Fox News poll if the election were held tomorrow he would claim a whopping 14% of them! Now, 14% sounds bad, but 16% are undecided. And if Romney works hard and captures them he -- would still lose very badly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;There is a strange new law making its way through the Arizona state legislature now. It's a bill that if signed by the governor would make it illegal to post negative comments on the Internet. It could ban people from terrifying, threatening, harassing, offending or annoying another person. I think this means Kim Kardashian is going to prison for a very long time. But, it's a serious thing. The penalty for annoying or offending someone is up to six months in jail. That is good. They are always saying the prisons are not full enough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Romney is catching heat for a possible violation of election rules. He was at Doesen's Subs and as you can see, he is handing out free sandwiches. Special Romney sandwiches. They come on really, really white bread. He gave them out to people and apparently this is against the law. The Democratic Party in Wisconsin fired a formal complaint. Not sure with who. Quiznos, maybe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Now that the general election is getting nearer, Obama has been asserting himself. This morning, he attacked the Republican plan, and called it social Darwinism. And earlier tonight, he told his wife, Michelle, 'I want some damn cheese on the damn veggie burgers.' He's hungry.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Passover begins this weekend. Which means the annual showing on TV of 'The Ten Commandments.' The movie, 'The Ten Commandments.' You know, I was thinking about this since it's Holy Week. Imagine if God tried to give the Ten Commandments today. The Senate would knock it down to five. The House would add a tax break for the rich people. And the Supreme Court would strike it down as a unconstitutional mandate. The whole thing would just go down the drain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new book coming out, Governor Rick Perry of Texas used painkillers to help him get through the Republican debate. Hey pal, join the club, okay. According to this new book, Perry had back surgery. He's now saying that his campaign was derailed by pain pills. And don't confuse that with Herman Cain's campaign. That was derailed by Viagra pills.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I read today, the earth's population is now well past seven billion people ... seven billion. And still, the Republicans can't find one candidate they really like.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, yesterday on the news, Senator John McCain half-jokingly suggested that Mitt Romney should pick Sarah Palin as his Vice President. Mitt Romney and Sarah Palin, huh? Talk about the bland leading the blind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the Rick Santorum campaign is now formally calling on Newt Gingrich to drop out of the race. But you know Newt. He has vowed to stay in. And believe me, when Newt Gingrich takes a vow, he keeps it, unless, of course -- you know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama admitted he is a trekkie. Did you hear that? He is a trekkie. Which explains why the President is polling very high with virgins age 45 to 60.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you guys see this? There was a new picture; it was just released, of President Obama giving the 'Star Trek' Vulcan salute at the White House. Pretty amazing. Even Spock was like, 'Whoa, look at that guy's ears.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of President Obama, his campaign is now letting supporters donate with a text message. Of course, it's going to be awkward when someone's like, 'Can I have that money back? I accidently butt-donated it to you.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a new internet trend called 'breading.' You guys know what that is?

The people holding the conference that wasted a ton of government money are the people in charge of making sure the government doesn't waste a ton of money. It's like the Center for Disease Control holding a conference in Andy Dick's jacuzzi. It's like the Justice Department selling guns to Mexican drug dealers. What? They-- they did? You've got to be kidding me!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, you know, I believe that America's greatest days are ahead of us. That's why every so often it is important to remind ourselves no, they're not. Because otherwise, Barack Obama might get credit for it. So you can imagine how I felt this morning when I turned on Fox News, only to face my worst fear. Good news.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is, of course, both Passover and Easter. In fact, did you hear what Mitt Romney did tonight? You know, I think he's trying too hard to get votes. He went to a Seder dressed as an Easter bunny.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tomorrow night, President Obama is hosting a special showing of the film, 'To Kill a Mockingbird' on the USA network. And Mitt Romney will be hosting a showing of the film, 'Wall Street.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Both President Obama and Mitt Romney are calling each other 'out of touch.' They're all saying the other one is out of touch. See, being considered out of touch, that's bad for a candidate. On the other hand, as Herman Cain and John Edwards have shown us, touching too much, also bad. There's a fine line.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid says he wants airport security workers to be nicer to foreigners. Could we be any nicer? I mean, they cross our borders whenever they want. They get jobs. They get bargain college tuition. We give them driver's licenses. We never ask them to leave. How much nicer can we be, really? I mean, could we be any nicer?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I read that Mitt Romney has spent $53 million on ads and Rick Santorum has spent $9 million. Meanwhile, Newt Gingrich drew a poster with his name on it and showed it in the background of the 'Today' show.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier this week, Mitt Romney actually criticized President Obama for being out of touch with the American people. Then Romney added, 'And I mean all Americans -- millionaires and billionaires. Everybody. Everyone.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Obama attended church services yesterday. You know, he hasn't been attending services regularly since becoming President because he feels his presence disrupts the services. Though this is election year, he goes every week to that new church the I Am Not a Muslim Cathedral. Have you seen that one?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today was the annual White House Easter Egg Roll or as Republicans call it, 'President Obama's Socialist Egg Redistribution Program.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Mitt Romney -- he had an Easter egg hunt at his house as well. Although he does it a little differently. See, he hides money offshore, then the kids hunt for the nest egg. The kids look for the nest egg. They go to the Caymans, they go to Switzerland.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Obama has signed into law a bill that bans members of Congress from insider trading. However, they're still allowed to mishandle campaign funds, cheat on their wives. And kill the occasional drifter. That's okay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bad news for the Governor of New Jersey, Chris Christie celebrating Easter, did you hear about this they rushed him to the hospital early Sunday morning with an impacted peep.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember Dick Cheney, former Vice President? ... He invited the neighborhood kids to his castle for an organ hunt. That's what happened. But here's the good news. Dick Cheney a couple of weeks ago had to go in, not feeling well, so they gave him a heart transplant, and doing fine. Doing fine. And when you have a heart transplant you get to keep the old heart ? and this weekend he and his wife made a lovely stew.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend Mitt Romney went body surfing. He has not body surfed, I think since the 90s when he starred on 'Baywatch.' But Newt Gingrich also, what a coincidence, talk about a coincidence, also went body surfing, was harpooned. Did you know that? Actually harpooned.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney's family is trying really hard to make Mitt seem like a regular guy. That is the strategy now. In a new interview that she just gave, Ann Romney says her husband, Mitt, is mischievous. Yeah, for example, she says his favorite prank is to ring someone's doorbell, run away and then buy the house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now Newt Gingrich, everybody is saying he is through. Newt Gingrich says he still has a chance. That people walk up to him all the time and beg him to stay in the race. It's a group of people known as Democrats.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new study finds that homophobia may be linked to a subconscious attraction to your own gender. Rick Santorum has called the study to believe as hard to believe as Ryan Gosling's perfect ass.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you guys see this over the weekend? Mitt Romney was actually spotted body boarding in California. Yeah. Romney would have gone surfing, but, you know, he hates standing for something.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here is some election news. Today, Joe Biden launched a new Twitter account to give supporters updates from the campaign trails, like his most recent update, 'They still won't let me go on the campaign trail.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;A beloved tradition took place in our nation's capital. 30,000 kids and their parents participated in the annual Easter egg roll, going on for 134 years. At this point, there has to be like thousands of undiscovered Easter eggs on the lawn of the White House. Future civilizations will think we were ruled by chickens. They did things a little bit differently. Normally they put a lot of eggs out. This year, they had all the kids go after one egg and armed them with sticks. Some sort of 'Hunger Games' tie-in there. It looked like a fun event. The only problem, Michelle Obama was put in charge of the snacks, which is like, that's like putting Rick Santorum in charge of a rave. Instead of jelly beans, the kids got actual beans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Mitt Romney was here in southern California celebrating Easter with his family at his house, coloring eggs with his grand children. He posted this to Instagram. If you zoom in, you can see they're painting Faberge eggs.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the big political news, Rick Santorum has dropped out of the presidential race. I'll tell you and Newt Gingrich wasted no time, he said, 'We're number two, yeah! If we could just get Romney to drop out, we've got this thing wrapped up.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, many Republicans didn't feel that Santorum could win the general election. And that coming out against birth control lost him the female vote and coming out against Internet porn lost him the male vote. It's hard to win when you lose both the male and the female votes. Those two blocks are pretty strong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to a website this week, President Obama's popularity is starting to dwindle among well-known liberals like Matt Damon and Gene Simmons. In fact, you know the number one liberal to turn on President Obama? Mitt Romney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Boy, the US Senate race in Connecticut reached a new low last week when one candidate called another candidate a 'whore' during a live television debate. The political analysts say that remark was inappropriate and such incivility among politicians not only turns off the voters, it's demeaning to whores.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was talking to a friend of mine who's a constitutional lawyer ... he said because the faith of what's his name ... Mitt Romney. Because Mitt Romney is a Mormon he can actually have several vice presidents. Did you know that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top Ten Words Rarely Used To Describe Mitt Romney:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been reported that Herman Cain is going to support Mitt Romney. In other words, Mitt Romney is going to get his first black supporter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Dow Jones is down for the fifth day in a row. Yeah. When asked for comment, GOP frontrunner Mitt Romney said, 'Don't worry, America, all my money's in Switzerland.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The FBI claims that American universities are being infiltrated by foreign spies. Did you know that? Yeah. In other words, Iran may have the technology to build their own beer bong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, Rick Santorum officially dropped out of the Republican race. Yep, Gettysburg was a great choice because, you know, he should have dropped out four score and seven years ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, many are speculating that Santorum dropped out now to avoid the embarrassment of losing to Romney in Pennsylvania, his home state, though given the number of houses Mitt Romney owns, Pennsylvania is probably his home state, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These days all politicians have a powerful media outlet at their disposal -- Twitter. And no Republican uses it more effectively than 78-year-old cyberpunk Senator Chuck Grassley. Over the weekend, Grassley caused a Twitter storm by responding to Obama's criticism of the Supreme Court ... I believe Grassley's just proving he's a fiscal conservative by refusing to buy a vowel. ... This isn't just tweeting. This is avant-garde stream of consciousness poetry. It's Jack Kerouac typing 'On the Road' with his thumbs. How does he do it? Is he in a trance? Does he rub tuna on his iPhone and let his cat have at it? Well, the Senator has let us inside his process, saying 'I love tweeting, but I don't like to type.' I know what he means. I love cooking, but I don't like to chop. Still, you should try my salsa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Interesting new poll. They do these opinion polls almost every day. This one is from 'The Washington Post' and ABC News. Sixty-four percent of voters prescribe President Obama as friendly and likeable whereas only 26% said the same thing about Mitt Romney. Obama scored higher than Romney on health issues and women's affairs. But Romney came in a solid first for who would enjoy doing the hokey pokey more.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new report that I read today, the average wedding now costs $27,000. Well, no wonder Newt Gingrich is broke. That's why he's broke.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, more problems for Newt. I'm starting to feel sorry for Newt now, actually. Apparently, I guess Newt Gingrich's campaign paid $500 to get his name on the Utah primary ballot. It's 500 bucks to get your name on the ballot, and the check bounced. Let me tell you something. You know if Newt is spending money he doesn't have, maybe he really is qualified to be President.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, a lot of Republicans feel Mitt Romney has the best chance to defeat Obama. Well, that is understandable. See, Mitt Romney knows how Obama thinks. You know how he knows? Because he used to think the exact same way. It wasn't that long ago, really.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Herman Cain -- remember old Herman Cain? Well, he now says he plans to endorse Mitt Romney, which is good news for Mitt. See, polls show Obama has the woman vote, but Herman Cain and Newt Gingrich, they can deliver the other woman vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, did you see that footage of Mitt Romney at the beach over the weekend? Relaxing with his family. He went boogie boarding. And they sat in the sand. They built a sand castle. Mitt Romney built a sand castle. Nine bedroom, four baths with a car elevator. About 10,000 square feet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I found out this week that legally Hillary Clinton cannot attend the Democratic Convention this year. You know why? Because she's Secretary of State. And as Secretary of State, she is not allowed to attend a partisan political event. Also this week, I found out why President Obama appointed Hillary Clinton Secretary of State. Because she can't go to the convention. He's a smart guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The price of gasoline has now doubled under President Obama's Administration. He and Jimmy Carter are the only two Presidents ever to have had that happen, to double the price of gas. But in fairness, at least under President Obama we don't have to listen to disco.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rick Santorum is now out of the race. A day after dropping out, he is trying to figure out his next move. That's right.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone is wondering who Mitt Romney's running mate going is to be. When asked about Mitt Romney's vice presidential pick, Herman Cain said he would bring some excitement to the ticket. Then he asked if Mitt Romney's wife is single.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush has complaints. At a conference yesterday, George Bush said he would wish people would stop referring to his tax policy as the Bush tax cuts. He also wishes people would stop referring to his presidency as the eight-year oopsie.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, here's some 2012 election update here. It turns out that Newt Gingrich's campaign wrote a $500 check to participate in the Utah primary but it bounced. It's true. Even MC Hammer was like, 'Manage your money, bro!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Get this, after dropping out of the GOP race, Rick Santorum emailed his supporters to ask for help paying off his campaign debt. So if you believe in his message of responsible spending and no handouts, just give him a handout to cover his irresponsible spending, please.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, I read that Harvard will soon offer a class called 'Understanding Obama.' While Barnum and Bailey Clown College will offer a class called 'Understanding Biden.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rick Santorum, ended his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination in a heartfelt concession speech yesterday afternoon. ... But even in defeat, Santorum was clear on just how impressed we should all be that a well-known former two-term senator lobbyist and television analyst even got this far.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All right, it's embarrassing that he [Gingrich] bounced a check. But you know what's more embarrassing? Spending your last $500 to go up against Mormon Mitt Romney in Utah.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mrs. Obama is here to mark the first anniversary of Joining Forces, the program she launched with Dr. Jill Biden to support our military families.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Big news out of North Korea today. You know, less than a month ago, North Korea agreed to stop developing nuclear weapons in exchange for the United States agreeing to stop developing 'Real Housewives' shows. And unfortunately, today, they attempted to launch a long-range missile. Apparently, they were unsuccessful. Reports say that it fell apart, it crashed. I guess they didn't drop in enough Mentos.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;But this is the new leader, by the way, of North Korea. This is Kim Jong Un. This is not a joke. This is the new leader. Kind of scary to think the fate of the world could potentially rest in the hands of the Korean Chaz Bono.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is so stupid. I love this stuff. The Obama Administration trying to distance itself today from remarks made by long-time Democratic advisor Hilary Rosen. She said on CNN last night that Mitt Romney's wife, Ann -- a stay-at-home mother of five, survivor of MS and cancer -- has never worked a day in her life. The ironic part -- because of that idiotic statement, she may never work another day in her life. So stupid. Let me tell you something -- if you're the mother of five boys, you never had a day off in your life, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And now, even Vice President Joe Biden, he's furious. He said, 'Making stupid comments that hurt the President, that's my job. She has no right.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me tell you something, did you see ? let me tell you something. That shows you how far we have come as a nation, when Democratic women can say things just as stupid as Republican men. I think it's a wonderful -- it's a wonderful thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I went to the mall, the famous Burbank mall, last night to do some shopping after the show. Newt Gingrich's picture was in every store window. Not campaign posters, just signs saying, 'Do not accept checks from this man. Do not accept checks from this man.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you heard that Newt Gingrich -- this is a fiscal responsibility -- couldn't get on the ballot in Utah because he bounced a $500 check to the Utah election office. Oh, he's hurting. He's hurting. Newt Gingrich is so broke, he is down to five meals a day. That's how broke.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Newt Gingrich is so broke, today he asked Mark Zuckerberg to marry him. That's how broke.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He is so broke, you know what he calls looking for change between the couch cushions? A fundraiser. That's a fundraiser.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Rick Santorum has suspended his presidential campaign. He dropped out after spending a weekend in prayer and then realizing he didn't have one, so he dropped out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All right. Newt Gingrich, not happy. Today, Newt Gingrich is blaming the failure of his presidential campaign on Fox News. That's what he said, yeah. Newt's also blaming the failure of his diet on Cinnabon. It's Cinnabon's fault.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Discussing Mitt Romney's claim that during President Obama's time in the White House, 92% of those who've lost jobs have been women, Colbert asked, &quot;But is Romney's attack on Obama true? Well, 'The Washington Post' fact checker column looked into Romney's 92% claim and judged 'this figure doesn't mean very much' concluding the claim was 'true but false.' Thank you Washington Post. Your reporting was helpful but useless.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What you have is Mitt Romney running around the country saying, 'Well, you know, my wife tells me that what women really care about are economic issues. And when I listen to my wife, that's what I am hearing.' Guess what.&quot; A clip was then shown of Democratic strategist Hilary Rosen saying of Mitt Romney's wife, Ann, &quot;His wife has actually never worked a day in her life.&quot; Colbert added, &quot;Did she put her foot in Obama's mouth. Excuse me, campaign strategist Rosen, you know what is actually never worked a day in its life? Attacking motherhood. Now folks, full disclosure -- I have a personal stake in this issue. Because I have a mom. My mom. Which makes me half-mom on my mom's side. Now, she was a stay-at-home mom of 11 kids, which I guess makes her twice as lazy as Ann Romney. And these remarks infuriate me, folks.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Crazy stuff happening over the weekend. Secret Service involved in a sex scandal, are you following the story? Eleven Secret Service agents are reportedly in trouble for having sex with prostitutes while on a trip to Colombia. In defense, the Secret Service agents are saying it's part of their oath to put themselves in ho's way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's right; eleven Secret Service agents reportedly had sex with prostitutes. People got suspicious when they noticed Secret Service agents wearing nothing but their sunglasses and earpieces, completely nude, walking around. No, people are wondering how the Secret Service agents were discovered in the first place. Apparently, one prostitute figured out they were Secret Service when her client pulled out a condom and yelled, 'Secure the perimeter!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems official, Mitt Romney is the GOP candidate, it's not official yet, but it seems official. Mitt Romney has already begun the process of choosing a running mate. Did you know that? Romney wants someone with a different ethnicity who appeals to women, so his first choice is President Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Democrats seem stunned by the reaction [to Hilary Rosen's comments] Here's why. For months the Republicans have been tearing each other apart. And the news media was focused on that. One right wing gaffe after another. Michele Bachmann thinking HPV vaccines cause mental retardation. Herman Cain's unorthodox lady employee measuring techniques. Rick Perry's summer retreat. No matter what Democrats did or said, nobody gave a [bleep] because any time they said it, the media would get distracted by Newt Gingrich's open marriage with a moon wife, like nobody knew. But last week Rick Santorum conceded. Primaries over. General election on. All the fire power the right is wasting on each other has now been retrained on their actual opponents. Like the Democrats didn't realize they had gone from England to America where the traffic is now coming from the other direction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, it has happened again! President Obama just returned from an economic summit in Colombia. Huge waste of taxpayer dollars. He was already in the District of Columbia! Seems redundant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, I've got to tell you, I feel somewhat responsible here. You see, the Secret Service was here last week to protect the First Lady and, like anyone who gets close to my virility, they obviously got their manhood jacked up. It's called being man jacked. Now, I don't know if it's the same team that was here but it wouldn't be the first time a visitor to this building had to seek professional relief after being here. Because-- and this is true-- according to the FBI's phone records, Eliot Spitzer called a prostitute in the car right after leaving my studio. ... This is clearly the President's fault! We all know it's the job of the President to protect the Secret Service. Because now not only does America owe billions to China, we owe $47 to a Colombian prostitute. A prostitute your grandkids will have to pay for!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;This week is National Volunteer Week ... It could not have come for a better time for 11 members of the Secret Service who have been suspended while authorities look into whether or not they hired prostitutes in Colombia. When the President goes anywhere, the Secret Service goes ahead to scout the area and make sure it's safe. Local police got involved when one of the prostitutes refused to leave a hotel room of an agent who owed her money. Now instead of being at work, they're at home with their wives and girlfriends. Good times. Is our economy really so bad we can't afford to pay our overseas prostitutes anymore? Sometimes I feel like we didn't learn anything from Tiger Woods.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;The Secret Service men weren't the only ones having a good time in Colombia. Just before 1:00 this morning, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was spotted in a bar in Colombia, dancing and drinking, having a beer. Somebody loosened the buttons on her pants suit, didn't they?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, 11 Secret Service agents were busted with prostitutes. ... Honestly, I don't want to judge these people. They're role models who sacrifice so much for others and so are the Secret Service. Here's what scares me though. If a Secret Service guy can't even go to a hooker and keep it secret, what hope -- ?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who I blame for this Secret Service brouhaha? The politicians. These agents spend a lot of time in Washington. You hang out in Washington long enough and the habits of politicians will rub off on you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama talked about the scandal today. He said he's reserving judgment until all the facts are in or at least until he figures out a way to blame this on Mitt Romney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The agents got busted in Colombia. They weren't the only ones going nuts there. Hillary Clinton spent the night out cutting a rug. That's not code. The pictures of Hillary were all over the internet from the weekend. No, look. That's the real picture. ... It's nice to see Hillary having a good time. The last time she danced like that was when TJ Maxx had a sale on pantsuits. Another picture shows Hillary drinking a beer. ... It's funny to see how the news media is reporting this. Fox News says she's guzzling a beer. While MSNBC says she's sipping a beer. Hillary herself said -- what did she say? She said, 'I do not always drink beer, but when I do, I drink Dos Equis.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More information has now come out about the Secret Service prostitution scandal in Colombia. ... One of these Secret Service agents is in trouble now for bragging to the prostitutes that he was there protecting President Obama. He was bragging.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama has ordered an investigation into the Secret Service sex scandal. And before Obama had even finished issuing the order, Bill Clinton said, 'I am on it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, now that he's the Republican nominee, Mitt Romney trying very hard to connect with voters. They say he might have problem connecting with real people. He said he isn't too rich to relate to average Americans. That's what he said. 'Just because I own six houses doesn't mean I can't relate to someone who only owns three.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ann Romney is defending her husband for strapping the family dog to the roof of their station wagon when on a family trip saying the dog loved it.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tough times for Newt Gingrich. During a campaign event at the Saint Louis Zoo, Newt Gingrich was bitten by a penguin. It was feeding time and Newt and the penguin were fighting over pieces of squid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, it's finally happening. America is falling in love with the idea of liking Mitt Romney. And they just can just get exactly enough of him. In fact, today's Gallup tracking poll has him beating Obama by five points! And it might be more since Mitt hides some of his points in the Cayman Islands. Well, folks, I for one know why America is jumping on the Romney bandwagon. Or at the very least being tied to the top of it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Thank you for coming. I want you to know that from an income tax standpoint, I consider all of you my dependents. Today was the deadline to file your tax returns. ... If you're watching this after midnight and haven't sent your tax forms in, you're going to prison, I guess. In case you're wondering where your tax dollars go, 21% goes to Medicare and Medicaid, 20% to social security, 20% goes to defense spending and the other 39% they squander.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;I don't mind paying taxes, I really don't. I understand we have to pay something to keep things going, but what I don't get, when we send in our return, why do we have to put stamps on the envelope? Can't they give us a pass on that? Isn't it bad enough that we have to write a check for thousands of dollars, and then we have to stick another $1.65 envelope? That's annoying. Next year, I'm not putting stamps on my envelope. And if you don't like it, send the check back to me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Mitt Romney and his wife Ann sat down at Fenway Park for an interview with Diane Sawyer. They talked about a lot of things. What I found most interesting was the story of Shamus the dog. Apparently the Romneys took a road trip from Boston to Canada in 1983, brought their Irish setter with them. But instead of letting him ride in the car, they put the dog in a carrier and strapped it to the roof for a 12-hour drive. Some animal lovers are upset about this. But the Romneys insist the dog loved it. I mean, is this really a big deal? Haven't we all seen cars zipping down the freeway with a dog -- no? Never? Me neither, come to think of it. I still don't think they meant any harm. The dog was saying 'Woof,' and they thought he was saying 'Roof.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;I don't know if this has anything to do with the dog, but there's a new poll that doesn't bode well for Mitt Romney's chances at the White House. According to this poll Mitt Romney is the least popular major party candidate since they started collecting this kind of data back in 1984. The poll shows only one in three Americans has a favorable view of Romney. He does even worse among dogs. He's one in eight with dogs. You know what? Popularity is overrated. The important thing for a leader is to stay true to the things you think people want you to believe. That's the key.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Overall, Obama is more popular than Romney. They're about neck and neck among white voters. But Romney has a strong lead among really, really white voters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a great day if you like paying your taxes. Hey, hey! It is your patriotic duty. A painful, annoying patriotic duty. Something every good American should do. Who doesn't pay taxes? Al Qaeda. That's who.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If nobody paid taxes, imagine what the country would be like. America would be flat broke. All right. We'd be more flat broke. I saw today that this year, the US will spend a trillion dollars more than it will take in. ... Look. I'm not an economist, but that doesn't seem to make sense. Experts say 32% of our taxes go to defense. And the rest buys hookers for the Secret Service.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is gearing up for his presidential campaign. He's created a new series of ads aimed at Latinos. The first ad boasts that 'Just last week my Secret Service created jobs for 11 Colombian women.' That's a lot of jobs.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Secret Service scandal is getting worse because ... apparently agents were also snorting cocaine. However, in the agents' defense, hotels in Columbia offer cocaine in the mini bar. If you think it's expensive on the street ?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney is weighing in. He said Secret Service personnel involved in the scandal should be fired for putting 'play time ahead of the nation.' So I think the real story here is that Mitt Romney describes prostitutes and cocaine as 'play time.' He's cooler than I thought.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Two days ago we were discussing an issue concerning the General Services Administration. Basically the facilities manager of the United States government. Their mission is to exemplify efficiency and cost-cutting, a task they felt could best be expressed by a lavish $822,000 three-day Las Vegas conference/epic [bleep] fest. Since then scandal has broadened out from one ostentatious not lost enough weekend to apparently systemic issues of corruption. So the GSA must now face one of the most feared groups in all of Washington. The House Oversight Committee, a terrible collection of people who, but for the grace of God, would probably have ended up working for an organization like the GSA.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, now that we conservatives are all thrilled to have no option but Mitt Romney speculation turns to who we will be forced to accept as his running mate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Maybe Romney should go with someone blander [than Sen. Portman] like a headless Joseph A. Bank mannequin or a rice cake or a heel of white bread. No, they're all too fascinating. Damn it. Who can Mitt Romney find who won't overshadow him? Wait! That's it! The perfect ticket! Romney/Romney's Shadow 2012. And the best part is it will change positions every time he does!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Mitt Romney is getting a lot of heat from animal lovers because of a story he told of when he put his dog Seamus in a pet carrier and strapped the carrier to the roof of his car for a 12 hour road trip. But now President Obama is the subject of a canine controversy, thanks to his own book. In Obama's memoir, called, 'Dreams from My Father,' he talked about his childhood in Indonesia living with his stepfather, Lolo, he said when he was eight years old, Lolo introduced him to a number of unusual meats, including dog. Our President ate dog.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What I find most amazing about this is this is not something that someone dug up on him from a distant relative in Indonesia or something. This was in chapter in a book the President wrote about himself. How did we miss this? If Ryan Seacrest wrote a book saying he ate dog, we would go nuts. I guess now you are either on Team Strap Your Dog to the Roof or Team Throw Your Dog on the Hibachi.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That Secret Service sex scandal keeps growing. More unfolds every day. Here's the latest, three of the Secret Service agents involved in the sex and cocaine scandal are now leaving the agency. Yeah. On the bright side, they're going to have one hell of a going away party.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday one of the prostitutes involved in the Secret Service scandal said an agent offered her only $30 for an $800 sex act. Apparently, the Secret Service's secret is that they are cheap bastards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, it's no secret that our cities are suffering a massive budget crisis. Municipalities have to cut back on fire departments, boards of health and public safety. In many cities the police have been replaced by a gun duct taped to a Roomba.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Reporters from the United States are hard at work in Colombia digging up anything on the Secret Service prostitution scandal. Prostitution is legal in a lot of Colombia, so it turns out the reason local police got involved in the first place is because of an argument between two agents and an escort. NBC News is reporting that there was a dispute in the hotel over how much she should be paid. The escort said they made an agreement the night before to pay her $800. Two guys and one girl, which is -- that's a lot for an escort. For that, you could get a Ford Escort, I think. In the morning after they promised her $800, they only gave her $30. And that's what you call a trade deficit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;The escort claims that the agents said they did not remember agreeing to pay $800, because they were drunk the night before and she refused to leave the room until she got paid. Eventually they settled for $225. These are the guys we should put in charge of negotiating our foreign debt. 'Sorry, China, we really don't remember borrowing. We were drunk. We'll give you a watch and some shoes.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Eleven Secret Service men are being investigated. So far, one has been fired, one resigned, one retired and the rest are thinking about leaving just because the party is over. It used to be a fun job and now all they're doing is standing around in sunglasses waiting to take a bullet for somebody they don't really know, which -- what's the point of that?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, folks, I guess spring break is now officially over all over the country. It's been six weeks of sex and drinking, but enough about the Secret Service!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, a member of the Secret Service advance team was in Colombia ahead of President Obama. He got in an argument with an escort over how much he owed her for her services. She said it was $800. He offered her $30. Finally, somebody in Washington willing to cut spending and they fire him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, that's why the Secret Service guys have those microphones in their sleeves, so they can compare prices. 'I got one here, Bob. She wants $40. I got the two for $35 a girl.' Well, now it seems that several of those agents involved in the scandal have hired lawyers. Lawyers, huh? Wait till they see how much they charge to screw them. $800 is a bargain, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see all the Congressmen, they're on their high horse this week, they wasted no time, all these Congressmen. As soon as the story broke they all boarded a flight to Colombia, to go on a fact finding mission. They're going to get to the bottom of this. In fact, the Congressmen said today, they had no experience with hookers in Colombia. Now, hookers in the District of Columbia, oh, plenty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The GSA, they were partying in Vegas. The Secret Service having sex with prostitutes. Suddenly working for the government is one long episode of 'The Jersey Shore.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's an interesting revelation. According to his book 'Dreams from My Father,' that's President Obama's book, President Obama said when he was a boy he ate dog meat. Dog meat? Today Mitt Romney's dog said, 'You know, riding on the top of the car, maybe that's not so bad after all. Whew! I'll take it! I'll take it!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Newt Gingrich -- is Newt Gingrich still in the race? What is he, $5 million in debt now? In fact, Newt Gingrich is so broke he's no longer attacking the poor because he is one. Newt Gingrich is so broke; he's got to go back to his old job selling Michelin tires. In fact, Newt Gingrich so is broke he said he may keep this wife another year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;God help me but I'm enjoying the big Secret Service scandal. Do you know what I am talking about? So the President has to go down to Cartagena and they send the Secret Service down there to check everything out and gosh darn wouldn't you know it they hire a bunch of hookers. And then I looked into it, here is what really happened. It turned out it was a frisking that got out of control. That's all it was. Just a pat-down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The whole thing started there in this hotel and one of the Secret Service agents, he had this woman. And the deal was $300. That was the agreed on, and he gave her $30. And she went crazy. I'm thinking, 'Wait a minute, I got no problem with a guy trying to save taxpayer dollars. I got no problem.' But I want to tell you something, I'm hot about this. Because these are jobs that should have gone to American hookers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you noticed, Mitt Romney trying very hard to appear human now. You notice that? [As Romney] 'I must fool them! Look, I am sweating. People on my planet told me this is how it's done'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney is now trying to deflect talk of his wealth by describing his grandfather's humble origins. That's what he's doing now Apparently Mitt's grandfather came to this country with nothing but the shirt on his back and dog on his roof.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama working hard. This campaign is going at it now. President Obama is proposing to keep student loans cheap as a way to appeal to college students. And if that doesn't work, Obama's going to switch to his second proposal, 'Hey, everybody, free pizza in my room.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Secret Service scandal continues. Congress now is expanding its investigation into the Secret Service prosecution scandal. Congressmen want to know how could this happen? Who was responsible? And do those ladies take Discover cards?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ever since Republicans started talking about defunding Planned Parenthood Democrats have accused the right of having a war on women. Well, that's ridiculous. Why would we go to war on women? They don't have any oil.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Details about the Secret Service and the Colombian prostitutes are continuing to emerge. A number of Secret Service agents, who are the guys who protect the President, are being investigated for misconduct or as they call it in Colombia, conduct. Initially 11 Secret Service agents were subjects of this investigation. Now a 12th agent has been identified. One more and they have a hooker's dozen.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, this story just keeps getting bigger and bigger. It now appears that as many as a dozen members of the Secret Service were involved in that Colombian prostitution scandal. Now six of the agents have been reassigned.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Government security analysts say this incident will send a message to all government employees that work in high security positions. That message, of course, is 'Just pay the hooker, will you?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Secret Service agents were caught after one of the agents refused to pay the hooker the $800 she wanted. He offered her $30. You think Washington's upset?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh! Well, according to President Obama's book, 'Dreams from My Father,' President Obama says he ate dog meat as a child. Hey, we all did that. It was called Chef Boyardee.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, congratulations to President Obama. He clinched his Democratic nomination yesterday. He got all the delegates he needed to get the nomination. Even though he's President, it's tough to do that. No Democrats ran against him. Well, if you don't count Mitt Romney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now listen to this. Dick Cheney said -- here's a guy that just got off the table. Dick Cheney says that President Obama is an 'unmitigated disaster as President.' Unmitigated disaster as President. This coming from the guy who invaded the wrong country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For the first time in 40 years, more Mexicans are leaving the United States than are coming to it. Yeah. That's true. Not because of our economy. Because they're sick and tired of explaining that Taco Bell isn't real Mexican food.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Secret Service scandal continues. Political analysts are saying that President Obama doesn't want to be too critical of the Secret Service because their agents protect him every day. Which explains why today President Obama said it was fiscally responsible refusing to pay the prostitute.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, Newt Gingrich is reportedly struggling with the question of dropping out of the presidential race. He's struggling, yeah. Gingrich said 'If there's one thing my two ex-wives know about me it's that I'm not a quitter.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On the campaign trail Mitt Romney said -- I love this ? 'I live for laughter.' Then he looked at his poll numbers among women and had a two-hour giggle fit.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight on the show we have the President of the United States, Barack Obama. Unfortunately, though, a lot of people aren't able to get tickets, that includes students, professors, Joe Biden. It was a very hot ticket.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even though the President just got here today, I've been here at UNC for two days now, and I've been having the best time hanging out with the Secret Service, they know how to party. Aye carumba!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After winning five primaries yesterday, Mitt Romney has his new campaign slogan ? 'Well, I Guess You're Stuck With Me Now!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it's pretty much a done deal, as you know. See, this proves with a little hard work and a little luck, even a multi-multimillionaire white guy from Harvard can succeed in this country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see that? And Newt Gingrich hinting he may withdraw from the race next week. He didn't do well. And he thought he'd win Delaware. Did not do well in Delaware. Know how bad he did in Delaware? He is three points behind John Edwards, okay? That's bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Newt's campaign is broke. He's out of money. In fact, Newt Gingrich is so broke; he's now taking financial advice from Nicolas Cage. He is so broke, he can't afford a hooker but he asked the Secret Service if he could watch. He is so broke; his Secret Service code name is 'Jon Gosselin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A very close call for President Obama yesterday on his trip to North Carolina. Did you see that in the news? Apparently two hookers approached his motorcade. Luckily, the Secret Service wrestled them to the ground. 'Keep your mouth shut!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the John Edwards trial -- you been following this John Edwards trial? A campaign aide to Edwards testified yesterday that John Edwards dismissed the woman he had a baby with as a 'crazy slut.' Yeah. That's what he called her, a crazy slut. As opposed to what he is, a cheap whore. So they pretty much deserve each other.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the wake of the Colombian prostitution scandal, another Secret Service agent has been removed from his position at the White House and demoted to protecting the animatronic Presidents at Disney World.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was watching Mitt Romney take a victory lap last night, and I was watching him, and I thought he gets a lot of criticism because he's kind of stiff. He's sort of cold. He's sort of aloof. And I thought, 'Let's look on the bright side of this.' Mitt Romney, honest to God, I think is an inspiration to kids all over this country who sadly were born without a personality. I mean, the sky is the limit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Newt Gingrich is out of the race. Out of the race. Who's going to replace the excitement in the Republican Party now that Newt's gone? But he said he made the decision after looking at his campaign realistically. Realistically? Really? Looking at it realistically what the hell were you doing in the race in the first place? Come on, Newt! Wake up! Holy crap. He had a long meeting. He made the decision after a long meeting. It was a closed door meeting. Newt Gingrich went in-- it was like a three, hour-four meeting, had a long, long meeting, talked it over with his chins.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kind of a goofy mishap for President Obama yesterday. When he stopped at a diner yesterday in Colorado, a young female college student accidentally spilled yogurt on him. Yeah, after hearing this, Bill Clinton said, 'Of course, yogurt! That's what I should have said, yogurt!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Good day for Mitt Romney yesterday. Yesterday Mitt Romney won all five of the primaries, all five, yeah. You see, apparently when you buy four primaries, you get the fifth for free. They punch your card and there you go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday the Dalai Lama said he loves George W. Bush as a person, but not as a President. That's what he said. When asked for comment, George W. Bush said 'I love him as a dalai, but not as a lama.' Probably said it all snippy-like, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday's show was incredible. We had the President of the United States, Barack Obama, on the show. Obama hung out with me backstage. Did Slow Jam the News. Gave a long interview. At one point I was like, 'Dude, don't you have a country to run? You have priorities.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney said his favorite iPad apps include Twitter, Scrabble, and Yelp, while Newt Gingrich's favorite apps include nachos, hot wings, and mozzarella sticks. Different kind of app.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of Mitt Romney, an artist in Minnesota is actually selling a nude painting of Romney on eBay. But I'm not a fan of the paint's name, 'Mitt's Bits.' I don't know why you couldn't think of a better name than that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's painful or me to witness the dismantling of the space flight program. ... They have also announced they are decommissioning Spacebook, the social networking site for NASA employees. We have lost the Spacebook race! This is the worst news in interstellar social network since the downfall of my MySpaceSpace. According to an internal NASA memo, 'participation has not been as high as anticipated. On average, only 14 users log in per weekday and zero on the weekends.' Yes, Spacebook averaged zero users on the weekends. Some weekends three users logged in, others, apparently, negative three. Although it is gone, I'm certainly glad we had Spacebook for as long as we did. I will never forget as a child being inspired by Neil Armstrong's famous status update 'small stepping, giant leaping, #mankind.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Two more Secret Service agents resigned yesterday as a result of the scandal about prostitutes in Columbia. While that's bad news for the White House and the agency itself, the good news is there are open positions for the Secret Service. It seems like a fun place to work.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney swept all five primaries the other night. So it looks like he's the nominee. And in his acceptance speech, Mitt Romney told the American people, 'Just hold on a little longer.' Which is the same thing he used to tell his dog when he was tied to the roof of the car. 'Just hold on a little longer. We'll be there very soon. Just hang on, Seamus!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you been watching this John Edwards trial? Oh my God, you talk about a fall from grace. I don't know what kind of president John Edwards would have been, but I'm pretty sure he would have gotten along really well with the Secret Service.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know, in the wake of the Secret Service prostitution scandal, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are praising Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan for his swift action and thorough investigation. Both Republicans and Democrats agree he's doing a great job. Isn't that amazing? Who knew all it took to bring Republicans and Democrats back together were a couple of whores?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a ten-year Marine Corps veteran who criticized President Obama on Facebook has been dishonorably discharged and will not receive his pension. The good news? He did get his own show on Fox News. So they worked something out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here is an interesting story. A South African airline is running a promotion where if you have multiple wives, the fourth one can fly free. Finally, some good news for Newt Gingrich, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Newt Gingrich is going to announce next week that he is dropping out of the presidential race. Now, if you wonder why he's waiting, it's because it takes him that long to gather a crowd.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You folks know about the presidential race? It's very complicated. It started out there were like 38 possible Republican contenders. Now it's all Mitt Romney. It's all his for the taking. Newt Gingrich, listen to this. Listen to the wording of this. Newt Gingrich says that next week he will announce that he is dropping out of the race. Isn't that already the announcement? If you say next week I'll announce I'm dropping out of the race, what what's the point of having the announcement next week? Newt, have some hand sanitizer. Get a hold of yourself. Newt Gingrich out of the race. Thanks a lot, there goes my condo on the moon. When one of the potential candidates drops out of the race that benefits Mitt Romney. For example in this case Newt Gingrich drops out of the race and he will assign to Mitt Romney all of his chins.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Presidential campaign in full swing now. Everybody's out there stomping, they have all hands on deck. In a speech today Vice President Joe Biden said the following, he said, 'I promise you the President has a big stick.' That's what he said. Now Joe Biden is banned from the congressional gym locker room.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new Republican ad came out that claims President Obama is now too focused on being cool. Yeah. President Obama hasn't responded to the ad because he's too busy snowboarding with the boy band One Direction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some good news for Mitt Romney. Did you hear this yesterday? Texas Governor Rick Perry endorsed Mitt Romney for President. Yeah. Perry said he chose Romney because out of the one candidate left, he's the best.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new poll found that Michelle Obama has a much higher approval rating than Barack Obama, which explains Barack's new slogan, 'Vote For Michelle Obama's Husband.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Republican group just released a new ad campaign criticizing President Obama for being too cool. Which is why Romney has a new ad that's, like, 'I'm Mitt Romney and I love fanny packs.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While discussing the US policy on Iran today, Joe Biden said that President Obama quote, 'Has a big stick.' In related news, Joe Biden is now banned from the White House steam room. They don't even want him. Don't even want him coming by there anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight, we begin overseas where Australian Rupert Murdoch, finds himself still in a spot of trouble in Great Britain, simply because several of his newspapers hacked the phones of celebrities, politicians, a 13-year-old murder victim and the relatives of some killed in action British soldiers and allegedly bribed Scotland Yard detectives to help with the cover-up. I could go on but I know many of you are probably eating in the next 24 hours.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;James Carville says Mitt Romney stole one of his famous lines. I don't remember Romney saying, 'Hello, children. I live in your nightmares.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, nation, the general election is in full swing. And it looks like the only voting bloc that matters, other than stay-at-home moms, socially conservative Hispanic dads and evangelical NASCAR uncles are the young people. In the 2008 election, Barack Obama had the kids in the palm of his hands. He was a historic candidate. He spoke their language, and he briefly toured with the Black Eyed Peas. But, Mr. Fresh-Faced Hopey-Changey of 2008 has now become Old Gray Haired Grandpa Who Didn't Close Gitmo. And the younglings are in play.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;According to a new ABC /'Washington Post' poll, both Michelle Obama and Ann Romney are more popular than their husbands. Although at this point, asbestos is more popular than their husbands. But while only 56% of Americans have a positive view of the President, 69% have a favorable view of Mrs. Obama. Do you think they use these polls when they have a fight? 'Excuse me, the last time I checked, 69% of everyone is on my side. So maybe think about that while you go sleep on the couch.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big medical news. According to the CDC, there's been a huge increase in ssstds. Those are Secret Service sexually transmitted diseases.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More bad news for the Secret Service. Yesterday on Take Your Daughter to Work Day, turns out the girls they took to work weren't really their daughters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, we're learning more and more about that whole Secret Service scandal. Apparently, the prostitutes in Colombia had code names for the different Secret Service guys they were seeing. I mentioned this the other night. Like the guy that kept wanting to change positions? His nickname was Mitt. That's what they'd call him. But the main guy, the main guy -- the guy who wanted to keep putting off paying for stuff until later? His nickname was Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, now some of the Secret Service agents claim that they did not have sex with any of the prostitutes because they were so drunk, they passed out as soon as they got back to the hotel. Well, that's reassuring to know, huh? Here, I thought we had Secret Service agents cavorting with prostitutes while on duty. No, no, turns out they were so drunk and unconscious, they couldn't do anything. Oh, thank God. Whoo, thank God for that. I feel so much more confident now in my Secret Service.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new campaign video by Barack Obama implies that Mitt Romney would not have killed Osama bin Laden if he had been President. And today, Romney shot back. He said not only would he have killed bin Laden, he would have strapped him to the roof of his car and taken him on vacation with him as well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the most terrible story I've ever heard. In China, man and a woman get in an argument over a parking space. Some parking space. Man and woman, she gets out of the car, killed the guy by squeezing his testicles until he died. Here's the worst part of the story. China put this woman in charge of collecting the US debt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big news, Mitt Romney-- maybe you heard this announcement-- is trying to appeal to Latinos. Apparently, Latinos and women are having trouble warming up to Mitt Romney, so he's doing more things to appeal to Latino voters. Today, listen to this, he tied a Chihuahua to the roof of his car.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Newt Gingrich dropping out of the Republican race. And people are saying what will Newt Gingrich do? Well, he's going to catch up on 'Downton Abbey.' That's number one. And right now he's working on a half-hearted endorsement for Mitt Romney. So he's got his hands full.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Mitt Romney was here in New York city for a fundraiser at a hotel. When Romney used the mini bar, he was like ' $12 for M&amp;Ms? What a bargain.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of the election, yesterday, Newt Gingrich said that next week his campaign will, quote, 'Go bye-bye.' Which is bad news bad news.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some more political news, after appearing on our show this week, President Obama has officially become the most televised President in history. Even Ryan Seacrest was like, 'Dude, scale it back. It's a little bit -- a little too much.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome, welcome. Well, folks, in the words of the Secret Service, 'Let's get started. We only have the room for an hour.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This Secret Service story is fantastic. On CNN, they said that, in addition to hiring prostitutes in Colombia, Secret Service agents may have visited strip clubs in El Salvador. Now, let me tell you. I think it's shameful these men are giving money to these women in other countries when we have whores in America struggling to make ends meet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it seems the Secret Service has withdrawn its protection of Newt Gingrich in advance of him formally announcing the suspension of his campaign. He was going to drop out tomorrow. Now he's dropping out Wednesday. You know, his Secret Service protection was costing us $44,000 a day. And I guess they figured it wasn't worth it anymore to protect Newt from all the people trying to ignore him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama has revealed his new re-election campaign slogan, 'Forward.' Just one word, 'forward.' That's a good message for Obama. He's telling voters, 'Whatever you do, don't look back at all those campaign promises I made. Just look forward, just look forward.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With this whole anniversary of bin Laden's death thing going on, a new campaign video by Barack Obama implies that Mitt Romney would not have killed Osama bin Laden if he had been President.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's a little bit of history for you. On this day in 1789, George Washington became the first President of the United States after just narrowly beating out Ron Paul.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congratulations to Ron Paul. He claimed victory this week in the Louisiana caucus after securing 74% of the delegates. Which means he's now inching closer and closer to still not being invited to speak at the Republican National Convention.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last week, the Supreme Court heard arguments about Arizona's strict anti-immigration law. Now, I don't know if it was obvious which way the court was leaning, but here's what happened. Halfway through the hearings, the five conservative judges demanded to see Sonia Sotomayor's papers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know it's the anniversary of Osama bin Laden. A year ago Osama bin Laden was killed. He was executed in Pakistan. ... And they say that Osama bin Laden would be alive today if his bodyguards hadn't been screwing around with hookers. That's what they said.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you guys see this? During a speech on Friday, Mitt Romney told students that if they want to go to college or start a business, they should just borrow money from their parents. Which should work fine, as long as your parents are Mitt and Ann Romney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some more election news, yesterday Bill Clinton joined President Obama on the campaign trail in Virginia. Yeah, Obama is staying at a Marriott. While Bill is staying at this place recommended by Secret Service.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, after the prostitution scandal in Colombia, Secret Service agents are banned from bringing guests back to their hotel room. Yep. The new policy is raising lots of questions like, 'So, your place then?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;I hosted the White House Correspondent Association Dinner on Saturday night. And the entertainment was me and President Obama. He was very funny, made jokes about the fact that he ate a dog. Some people thought it was undignified for the President to joke about it. Personally, I feel like once you eat a dog, dignity is pretty much out the window. Get what you can out of it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;There's a strange development in the Secret Service prostitution saga. ... They issued new rules of conduct on Friday and on some trips, they will send chaperones to make sure those rules are enforced. ... Am I nuts, or is this weird? We have to give the Secret Service chaperones to make sure they don't get drunk and have sex? What is this, a high school dance? The Secret Service has just hired themselves a nanny. We should make them travel with their moms. The chaperones will be highly trained themselves and will be ready to throw their bodies on any agent who is about to throw his body on a prostitute.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But earlier today, President Obama made a surprise visit to Afghanistan. He's in Afghanistan right now. And of course, the Secret Service is not happy. Have you ever been to Afghanistan? Booze is illegal. There's no hookers. Oh, my God. You've got to do your job and guard the President!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well have you heard about these new rules? The Secret Service announced that agents will now be assigned chaperones on certain trips. What are you, 14? What is that? I thought the Secret Service was the chaperone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And German authorities report they have discovered digital files hidden in a porn movie that outlines Al Qaeda's plans for more terrorist attacks. Al Qaeda was hiding their plans in a porn movie. I believe this is the first time that a porn film has ever contained a plot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know how they calculate this but listen to this. Since Osama bin Laden was killed the brand name of Al Qaeda has been damaged. Think about that. Osama bin laden's death has damaged the brand Al Qaeda. That and poor customer service.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who's in town today? Take a guess. Mitt Romney. Mitt Romney has not been in New York City since he used to anchor the Channel 7 news.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you guys see this? During a speech yesterday, President Obama said he's not very good at fixing things around the house. Obama is all right with a hammer, but usually he leaves the screwing to the Secret Service. Get it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So let me get this straight. Republicans, you are annoyed by the arrogance and braggadocio of a wartime President's political ad. You think he is divisively and unfairly belittling his opponents. I see. I have a question. Are you on crack? Were you alive lo, these past ten years? It seems unseemly for the President to spike the football? Bush landed on a [bleep] aircraft carrier with a football stuffed codpiece, he spiked the football before the game had even started!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Your Republican caterwauling and outrage is the subject of our new segment: 'You Are Aware That The Frontal Lobe Of The Cerebral Cortex Gives Us The Ability To Store And Recall Past Events As They Occurred, Right?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, you know, the general election hasn't even officially kicked off but today Barack Obama used taxpayer dollars to campaign in a key swing state-- Afghanistan. We've been fighting there for so long I believe they now get three electoral votes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama first addressed the troops at Bagram Air Base then met with Hamid Karzai to sign a security agreement which lasts through 2024. So to those who had 23 years in the Afghan war pool-- you win?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Presidents don't spike the football. You do an end zone dance on an aircraft carrier even if you never found the football! I believe that was aboard the USS Humility.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;One year ago today bin Laden was still alive and Tupac was still dead. Isn't that something? Remember how excited, everyone was cheering, 'We got him, we got him!' Just for the record, we didn't get him, the Navy SEALs got him. I was on my couch eating crescent rolls and watching 'Dance Moms.' The identities of that SEAL Team 6 is still a mystery. That is amazing. If I had killed bin Laden, I don't care what oath I took. I would have gone on a 50 state bragging tour. I would have had my name legally changed to 'I Killed bin Laden Kimmel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;President Obama made a surprise trip to Afghanistan today to commemorate the anniversary. He gave an inspiring speech to troops, followed by dinner at TGI-I'm Leaving and then got right the hell out of there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rupert Murdoch got some bad news today. Remember Rupert Murdoch? He's the media mogul who has so much money he makes Mitt Romney look like a hobo. Today British lawmakers said Murdoch was unfit to run a company. I'm like, 'Is that news?' He's 160 years old, out of touch with everything. Of course he's unfit to run a company. But perfect to run a Hollywood studio, or Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, as you know, President Obama made a surprise visit to Afghanistan yesterday. It wasn't as big a surprise as last year's Navy SEALs trip to Pakistan, but it was big. It was big. He met with the President of Afghanistan and he told the Afghan people that future generations of Afghans will be free and it'll all be paid for by future generations of Americans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Vice President Joe Biden he stayed behind. He did not go on this trip. Well, thank God for that. I mean, what if there'd been an emergency here at home and Americans needed somebody to come up and say exactly the wrong thing at exactly the wrong time?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Mitt Romney fighting back at charges by President Obama and Vice President Biden that if Romney were president, Osama bin Laden would still be alive. Romney said if he were President, bin Laden would have died a slow and painful death. He wouldn't order a hit. He would've canceled his healthcare.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Obama has come up with a new campaign slogan. 'Forward.' That's the slogan, one word, 'forward.' And believe me, if unemployment doesn't improve by November, it'll be 'Forward My Mail.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Newt Gingrich ended his presidential campaign today. Over $4 million in debt. He's $4 million in debt. Hey, say what you want about Newt Gingrich. While other Republicans just claim people are worse off today than they were four years ago, Newt proved it. He talked the talk. He walked the walk.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney, you know who I'm talking about, right? And it looks like he's going to be the Republican candidate for President. And if the election were today, would you vote for-- would you get out and vote for Mitt? Would you get out there and pull Mitt's lever? Okay, I'll give you a second to think it over? Well, you know, the gripe about Mitt Romney is that he's stiff. He's not an easygoing guy, he doesn't shoot from the hip. He's kind of rigid and his wife-- who, by the way, is beautiful, Ann Romney-- or as I call her, Mrs. Mitt ? she recently said on a television interview inside Mitt is actually a wild and crazy guy. Now the problem is inside that wild and crazy guy is a man who is even duller than Mitt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll tell you how crazy Mitt Romney is. One time he was just absolutely went nuts, went to a Halloween party dressed as Mitt Romney. That's how crazy he is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President of the United States pulled one of those old things where he sneaks out in the middle of the night, heads to Afghanistan, shows up and surprises everybody.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, anyone who watched the Supreme Court hearings last month knows that Obamacare is on life support, and Justice Scalia is about to put a pillow over its face. I'm so relieved that we're getting rid of universal healthcare before the unthinkable happens, like, it works. Now, sure, once Obamacare is dead, we'll still have over 50 million uninsured people, but Republicans have a plan to eventually come up with a plan. Should be any day now because John Boehner was spotted at Staples buying a dry erase board.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Besides, folks, we know America already has a safety net for the sick. Yes, by law, emergency rooms can't turn anyone away. And they're great for all kind of care-- bring your child in with an ear ache, and by the time you're seen by a doctor he'll be a healthy 32-year-old. Of course, emergency care is particularly expensive. In 2010 alone, hospitals racked up $39.3 billion in unpaid emergency room care. That leaves hospitals holding the short end of the stick, and this being an emergency room, you don't want to know where the other end is lodged.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, as you know, President Obama was in Afghanistan earlier this week, as part of his big Did I Mention I Killed Bin Laden Tour. He's kind of traveling around and Mitt Romney is criticizing the President. He said Obama should not politicize the death of Osama bin Laden. Mitt Romney made that announcement on the anniversary of bin Laden's death, standing next to Rudy Giuliani, at a fire station in New York City, at 9:11 in the morning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to documents just released by the US government Osama bin Laden ran Al Qaeda like a typical corporate CEO. You know what that means? He was twice as evil as we originally thought.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love this story. I don't know if you read President Obama's book, 'Dreams of my Father,' but President Obama admitted this week that a former girlfriend that he wrote about in his autobiography was made up and not a real person. ... So Obama had an imaginary girlfriend. Big deal! He had an imaginary economic plan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new survey found that more Americans are taking their money out of banks and keeping it in their homes. Well, the banks aren't worried, because they get the money back once they take possession of the home. So, they don't really care. It's all the same to them.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this week the President unveiled his new campaign slogan, 'forward.' That's his new slogan. Just one word, 'forward.'

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, we are learning more and more from those newly-released documents that we got from Osama bin Laden's compound.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, in an effort to curtail health costs the Food and Drug Administration is now considering -- they're considering allowing the purchase of drugs without a prescription.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The country of France has a new president. He is Socialist Francois Hollande.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama has admitted that a former girlfriend that he wrote about in his autobiography -- remember the autobiography? He now admitted that was made up.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama has his new re-election campaign slogan, 'Forward.' It's just one word, forward. Have you been watching this election? Can we press fast forward?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During the basketball playoff coverage on TNT over the weekend, you see this? Charles Barkley spotted Mitt Romney at the Boston Celtics game and said, 'We're gonna beat you like a drum in November.' He said, 'You're going down, bro.' That's what he said. He said, 'You're going down, bro.' Which I think is the first time in history anybody's referred to Mitt Romney as 'bro.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Obama campaign introduced a new ad today in which it talks about the jobs President Obama has created. Wow, you thought the girlfriend was imaginary.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the Pew Hispanic Center, for the first time in 40 years, in 40 years, more Mexicans are leaving the United States than are coming in.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Joe Biden said something interesting. In a new interview, Vice President Joe Biden said the sitcom 'Will &amp; Grace' made America more comfortable with gay people. Yeah. Biden also said the sitcom character Urkel made America more comfortable with President Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of President Obama. He has officially kicked off his campaign. President Obama says his campaign for a second term is still about hope and change. Yeah.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Vice President Joe Biden has come out in support of same sex marriage. Now, President Obama never endorsed gay marriage. But now he's in favor of gay Secret Service agents.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And police in Fort Wayne, Indiana, arrested a man for allegedly driving three blocks with four young children strapped to the hood of his car. Good to see Mitt Romney spending some time with the family, huh?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And new predictions out today claim 42% of Americans will be obese by the year 2030. They say the only way to stop that is for the government to step in. Oh, yeah, when it comes to trimming the fat and tightening your belt, what better way than the US government?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, we have the incumbent, President Barack Obama and it looks like his Republican opposition will be Mitt Romney. The Mitten. Mitt Romney. And he's receiving endorsements now. Rick Santorum gave Mitt his endorsement. He e-mailed his endorsement at 11:00 at night and said 'Oh, before I go to bed, okay.' So Mitt gets all of Rick Santorum's delegates and all of his sweater vests.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now here's something I don't understand. Mitt Romney, it seemed to me at one point he said -- do you remember the big financial recession and the auto companies were going broke and I believe -- I thought Mitt Romney had said 'Let them go broke.' He said. 'Let Detroit go broke and we'll figure something out after that.' Now he's saying he single-handedly saved the auto industry. That's what Mitt is saying now. Mitt Romney is saying 'I saved the auto industry.' Yeah. And for the last 20 years I've been hosting the 'Tonight Show,' so there you go. Depends on how you look at it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're looking for a Vice President for Mitt and I said 'Forget the Vice President, you ought to be looking for personality for Mitt.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hate to dampen everybody's spirit but they busted up another one of these exploding underpants plots. They go find a guy, Al Qaeda finds a dumb guy and say 'Listen, here's what we want you to do, hop on the next flight from Yemen to Detroit and put exploding devices, dynamite, explosives.' There it is. In your underpants. Well, the first time that didn't work and then they busted up this one. I think the only guy who's had any luck with exploding underpants was Anthony Weiner. All I can say is thanks a lot underpants bombers because now at airport security we have to put our underpants in a tray. Honest to God.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rick Santorum finally endorsed Mitt Romney at 11:00 at night. When reached for comment, Santorum said 'When I can't sleep I try endorsing Mitt Romney for President and it puts me right out.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apparently Rick Santorum endorsed Mitt Romney last night, very late, via email. Yeah. Just makes Santorum the 10 millionth guy who is ashamed of what he did late last night on his computer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some people a little upset with George W. Bush. It just came out taxpayers paid for George W. Bush's phone bill even when he was out of office. The bill was over $80,000. Yeah. Apparently Bush called 411 thousands of times to ask if Santa was real.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's some good news for Republicans. I read that in the last year, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's approval rating has gone up 12 points. That's impressive. Usually, the only time he picks up a dozen is when he goes to Krispy Kreme.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So with regards to gay marriage the Vice President's new position is consistent with the President's position which has not changed and is also changing. That's not a social policy that's a Zen koan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So far this year 70% of all presidential ads have been negative. That's not even counting the positive Gingrich ads, which are still kind of negative because they include Newt Gingrich.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[On Super PACs] &quot;Yes, secret billionaires are just trying to get involved in the political process, the same way the Secret Service wanted to get involved with those prostitutes. So to protect themselves from accountability, big donors need anonymity. Like casino billionaire Sheldon Adelson, who almost singlehandedly funded Newt Gingrich's Super PAC, Winning Our Future, which has recently been renamed Dodging Our Creditors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now Adelson is going underground, where it's possible he also originated. He says, from now on, if he injects big bucks into this election 'It will be to a C-4.' He's talking about super-secret 501-C-4s, or as they're now called, 'Spooky PACs,' which can accept unlimited money without ever disclosing their donors because they're technically social welfare organizations. Their negative attack ads count as charity. In the same way that yelling, 'Get a job, you dirty bum,' is a donation to the homeless. Of course, I have a spooky PAC. Colbert Super Pac Shhh. You know our motto: 'Making a Better Tomorrow at a Later Date That's None of Your [bleep] Business.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Rick Santorum last night finally endorsed his former rival for President. It's the fun part where people who say bad things about each other, suddenly pretend they're on the same team. It's like a 'Jersey Shore' special. Usually they do these on television together, but in this case, Santorum made the endorsement on the 13th paragraph of an e-mail he sent out just before midnight last night. Sounds like somebody had a bottle of sparkling apple cider for dinner. He woke up this morning and said, 'I endorsed who?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the big story -- just a few hours ago, President Obama announced he officially announced he is in favor of gay marriage. How about that? Of course, this is a monumental event. You know why? This is the first time Joe Biden said something Obama didn't have to apologize for. Amazing. Amazing. In fact, he changed his campaign slogan from 'Forward' to 'Fabulous.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, this is the first time an American President has come out in favor of gay marriage. In a related story, Rick Santorum's head just exploded.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who is really against the President's position on gay marriage? Gay men afraid of commitment. Now they have no excuse. Now you're just like us, guys! Thank you! Sorry! Sorry. Welcome to equality!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, last night on this program we applauded the CIA for disrupting that plot by Al Qaeda to take down a US jet using an underwear bomber. But the CIA said today we're not out of the woods yet because as you know, underwear is usually sold in packs of three.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Michele Bachmann has announced she is now also a citizen of Switzerland. Michele Bachmann has dual citizenship now. Today she became a citizen of Switzerland. What better way to protest a President you think is socialist than to become a citizen of a country with a socialist philosophy and a mandated healthcare plan?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, we hear a lot of talk these days about Al Qaeda and how the membership and recruiting of Al Qaeda is sort of drying up. People are not as excited about signing up to be part of Al Qaeda as they used to be and I think one thing -- and far be it from me to tell terrorists about strategy -- I think membership started to subside when they went to the suicide bomber exploding underpants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know, it's come down to Mitt Romney and Barack Obama and&quot; Romney is &quot;fighting his image that he has no personality and the reason for this, of course, is that he has no personality.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today President Obama announced that he supports same-sex marriage, ladies and gentlemen. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This broke a couple hours ago. Today, President Obama came out in favor of same sex marriage. Big story. He said he hoped his support would make it easier for gay people to get married and for John Travolta to get a massage.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Lots of historic stuff is happening. Yesterday, people in North Carolina voted to ban gay marriage and civil unions. Yeah. So if you're gay and you want to get married in North Carolina, you'll just have to pretend you're cousins.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The amendment in North Carolina defines marriage legally as between one man and one woman. And it passed despite Bill Clinton making calls urging people to vote against it. Yeah. Bill Clinton got involved. Yeah. Clinton told them, 'Take it from me, you don't want to limit marriage to one man and one woman. You want a little wiggle room there.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some huge, huge political news today. Barack Obama became the first US President to endorse same-sex marriage. Not to be confused with Bill Clinton, who is the first president to endure a no-sex marriage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama says he thinks same-sex marriage should be legal. Then he said 'Okay, now where's my show on Bravo?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New Jersey Governor Chris Christie said he's not sure if he's going to run for re-election next year. He was like 'Oh, I'll collapse that bridge when I get to it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday on this program, for those of you who watched, I don't watch this program, we may have insinuated President Obama was somehow being disingenuous in giving in to his most base political calculations by not just saying he favors same-sex marriage and equal rights for all Americans. That his 'position is evolving' is weak tea. What we didn't know at the time is that he had already planned to say today at 3:00? I'll let you watch the tape. [Runs tape of Obama endorsing gay marriage] There you have it. The President of the United States is gay ... friendly. Gay friendly. Damn you, ellipsis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think one of our presidential candidates just moved the whole situation in the wrong direction. And you know just what I'm talking about. This afternoon your marriage started feeling a little weak, didn't it? You got a sudden urge to abandon your family and go antiquing up at the Cape. It's all because today Barack Obama became the first sitting President to push the rainbow button and launch gay-megeddon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;President Obama came out with approval of same-sex marriage. In an interview with Robin Roberts of ABC, he said over the years, he has been going through an evolution on the issue. And which makes the opponents on the far right doubly angry. They don't believe in gay marriage or evolution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Meanwhile, another former Democratic candidate for President, Hillary Clinton is making headlines now for non-political reasons. She attended a number of public events without makeup on. Which -- is that a big deal? I'm pretty sure Colin Powell went without makeup a lot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today President Obama said today he supports gay marriage. Which is great news for the gay community. It wasn't all positive though. He also said the show 'Glee' has jumped the shark.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney responded today by restating his own views on marriage. He said marriage should only take place between two consenting rich people. Then he said he had no problem with gay people, because one of his best friends owns San Francisco.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is big news -- this is a big step forward for gay rights. Soon we may live in a world where the only people opposed to gay marriage will be gay people who are married.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You don't fool me. I know why you're all here. You couldn't get invited to the fundraiser at Clooney's house. That's why you're here. Well, earlier tonight, George Clooney held a record breaking fundraiser for President Obama right over here, in Studio City. There was one awkward moment at the party, when a Secret Service agent tried to give Paris Hilton 30 bucks. It was a little awkward.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the big story, President Obama has come out in support of gay marriage. He said his position has been evolving for years. Miraculously, he saw the light just in time for tonight's big Hollywood fundraiser. What are the odds? What are the odds of that happening?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Newt Gingrich didn't agree or disagree on the gay marriage thing. However, he did say there should be a term limit on all marriages. That's what Newt would like to see.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, we are learning more and more about Mitt Romney's early years. And today, Mitt Romney apologized for pranks and hijinks, as he called them, that he committed while in high school. It seems while at the prep school, Romney bullied a kid for having long hair and then ridiculed the same kid for only having an American Express Gold Card, not platinum. And then, another time, he took a student's lunch money and put it in an offshore bank account.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as you know, the CIA disrupted a plot by al Qaeda to take down a US jet using the underwear bomber. Another underwear bomber. And agents say the sophisticated new explosive underwear was redesigned -- I guess the terrorist claimed old ones had the tendency to give them a wedgie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama says that he supports same-sex marriage. Yeah. Not only that but he's going to turn his birth certificate into a musical.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Mitt Romney is kind of bragging about when he was a kid, he had a wild streak. Here is what it was. He was arrested and he launched his yacht and police noticed that the yacht didn't have like an identification number on it. So they arrested him. This guy's a real Al Capone, isn't he? This guy is a one-man crime spree, am I right? And when this happened, when he was arrested think about this, Mitt was lead away in his bathing suit, dripping wet and in handcuffs. By God that ought to get him a couple of gay votes, don't you think?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top Ten Other Mitt Romney Offenses:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. First degree handsomeness</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Possession of more than four ounces of conditioner</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Was late paying sales tax for his dancing horse</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Presses every button before getting off his beach house car elevator</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Once wore corduroy with seersucker</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Vaccinations overdue for dog tied to roof of his car</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Reckless blow-drying</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Grand theft loafer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Butchering 'America the Beautiful'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Involuntary dullness.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama's in town for a fundraiser at George Clooney's house where dinner, get this, is $40,000 a plate. When Mitt Romney said, 'That's ridiculous. You can't get a decent meal for $40,000. It's insane, not with wine.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday President Obama came out in favor of gay marriage because his position has evolved. Then today he flew to George Clooney's house. Yeah, so things are evolving a lot faster than we expected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House admitted that Vice President Biden's endorsement of gay marriage forced him to come out in favor of it. So in a related story millions of Americans are trying to get Biden hooked on pot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney apologized today after it came out that he bullied fellow students back in high school. Apparently, he held a kid down and said over and over again 'Your dad only has one house.' No, this is true. Mitt Romney has issued an apology for some of his high school pranks that I guess went a little too far. Probably the meanest prank was the time he bought his high school and fired everyone in it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After President Obama announced his support for gay marriage, his campaign raised $1 million in 90 minutes. Which explains why, today, Mitt Romney actually supported gay marriage from noon to 1:30.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Hey, as you know, yesterday, President Obama came out in favor of same sex marriage. He said his position on the subject has evolved. Apparently, he's been watching a lot of 'Modern Family' and who can resist Mitchell and Cameron?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;After Obama spoke, Mitt Romney weighed in, saying his opinion has not changed. He believes that marriage should be between one man and one woman, which is better than his grandfather, who believed it should be between one man and five women.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;There's an interesting article in 'The Washington Post' today about Romney. They interviewed some of his high school classmates, some of whom described him as a prep school bully, which -- prep school bully, like Mitt, sounds like a John Hughes movie. Somebody call Molly Ringwald. They claimed he picked on some of his gay classmates. According to the article, he pinned a gay student to the ground and cut his hair, which, ironically, is a pretty gay thing to do, when you think about it. Wrestling and hair dressing. Another former classmate claims a kid got up, spoke in front of the class, Romney said 'Atta girl.' Romney said he didn't know the kids were gay at the time; so he wasn't being homophobic, he was just being a jerk. I can see that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a great day for Rick Santorum. It's his birthday. He is 54 today. If you want to get him a present, don't tell him what Obama said yesterday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney's in a little hot water. Turns out he bullied a classmate back in high school. Apparently he pinned a guy down and cut his hair. ... This is bad for Romney because he looks like 'flip-flopper.' On the one hand, he's strongly against gay marriage. On the other, he used to be a hair-stylist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama's in town for a fundraiser. Forty grand a plate. ... Because nothing says 'Man of the People' like demanding 40 grand for some rubbery chicken.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, President Obama was in town last night for a big fund-raiser at George Clooney's house. You know, I had a hunch the President was in town. 'Cause on my way to work last night on Sunset Boulevard, I saw a Secret Service agent arguing with a hooker.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night at the fund-raiser, President Obama got up and gave a speech supporting gay marriage. Then George Clooney got up and gave a speech against straight marriage. So it was a nice balance for the evening.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Bristol Palin attacked President Obama today on the issue of gay marriage. She said kids do better with a mom and a dad in the house, unless of course the dad is Levi Johnston, then it's not such a good idea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this has become quite a story. 'The Washington Post' reporting that Mitt Romney while in high school bullied a gay classmate. Did you hear about this story? In his defense Romney said he didn't know the kid was gay, he just thought he was poor. Anyway, today Mitt Romney apologized for holding down Michele Bachmann's husband and cutting his hair. So, apparently it worked out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney was arrested for disorderly conduct when he was in his 30s. Isn't that amazing? He was a high school bully in his 30s. And he would steal lunch money from the other kids and then he would invest it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney says that he's taking credit for bailing out the auto industry. Mitt Romney said he wanted to bail out-- he said he's taking credit for it. I remember when Mitt Romney said, 'Let them go bankrupt.' But no, now, Mitt Romney is saying he bailed out the auto industry. Ladies and gentlemen, his damn dog has done more for the auto industry than Mitt Romney has done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama became the first President to come out in support of gay marriage. He said he consulted his daughters before making the big announcement. Which also explains why next year we may be looking at Attorney General Justin Bieber.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Mitt Romney has jumped to a seven-point lead over President Obama in a national poll. I think Romney's starting to get cocky. Like today, he threatened to pin down Joe Biden and pull out all his hair plugs&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, there was a huge fundraiser for President Obama at George Clooney's house last Thursday night. They raised over $15 million. Actually, one awkward moment when they were handing President Obama the check for $15 million. The Chinese ambassador stepped in and said, 'I believe that belongs to us.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, President Obama was in Nevada this weekend. Finally some good news for the Secret Service. A place in America where prostitution is legal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;God, how about JPMorgan. You been following this story? JPMorgan announced they lost $2 billion last quarter. $2 billion. That's 133 Obama/Clooney fund-raisers, you know that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You all know who JPMorgan is, right? He's Captain Morgan's drunk brother who's bad with money.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Newsweek' is calling President Obama our 'first gay President.' Did you see that? First gay President. And I am no historian but I always thought our first gay President was Zachary Taylor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, how about this, JPMorgan and those guys, they lost $2 billion in bad trades. I mean, they made bad investments. ... Like, for example, bad investments, those gay wedding chapels in North Carolina. Come on! What were they thinking?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney presidential presumed nominee for President, Mitt Romney once lost $2 billion. $2 billion, then he found it in another pair of pants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody saying Mitt Romney not a real guy, kind of stiff, like a cardboard cutout. Doesn't have the personality. Doesn't have that verve, that joie de vivre that everybody is looking for. We want a guy that is really a guy so now they are starting to dig up stuff on Mitt Romney. One time he was arrested for disorderly conduct and being a public nuisance. Remember that time when he was a kid? He had one of his hairs out of place. Another time he launched a boat without a license. They hauled him away in handcuffs and wet swimming trunks. And that should help the gay vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I saw that President Obama and Mitt Romney both gave commencement speeches over the last few days. Obama was like, 'You can be whatever you want to be.' While Romney was like, 'I can be whatever you want me to be.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But, actually, during his commencement speech at Liberty University, Mitt Romney revealed that his campaign staff loves Chick-Fil-A. The other thing that he revealed is that he doesn't know what to say in a commencement speech.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I read that on Saturday, President Obama and Joe Biden spent more than four hours playing golf together. Joe Biden's handicap was 20, while Obama's handicap is Joe Biden.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, as you know, the new issue of 'Newsweek' has President Obama on the cover with the caption 'The First Gay President.' Can you believe that? They are still publishing 'Newsweek?' Really?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This gay story already causing President Obama some problems. In fact, right after the story broke; he was sued by three male massage therapists. Yeah, they've come forward now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the country of Greece, oh, my God, they are in such dire financial straits they are going to dissolve their government. They're deep in debt. They got themselves in a gridlock. People are losing hope. And yet, financially, they are still better off than the state of California.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, man, the whole economy is hurting. I was in Beverly Hills the other day; I saw a woman at a gas station using one of those coin operated vacuum cleaners for liposuction. That's how bad. That's how bad it is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, here's some shocking news. The average college graduate now leaves school $27,000 in debt. But the good news, now it means they are more than qualified to work as financial advisers at JPMorgan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rush Limbaugh. Big fatty boy Rush Limbaugh. Big fat blow hard Rush Limbaugh. He says that President Obama is waging war on traditional marriage. I want to tell you something. Nobody loves traditional marriage more than Rush Limbaugh. He's had four of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know they're now saying in school Mitt Romney was bullying people. He doesn't remember bullying people in high school. So he would knock kids down and steal their lunch money and send it to the Cayman Islands. He doesn't remember any of that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, Ron Paul is out of the race, ladies and gentlemen. He notified supporters by e-mail. That's the same way George Clooney breaks up with his girlfriends. Not surprising Ron Paul quit. Who could keep going at that white-hot pace?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone is now discussing the Obama 'Newsweek' cover. Have you seen this? Yes, this is crazy. The new issue of 'Newsweek' features President Obama on the cover with the caption 'The First Gay President.' Apparently the new managing editor of 'Newsweek' is a third-grade bully.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama went on 'The View.' Did you see that? He went on the 'The View' because they're the only group of women the President trusts his Secret Service agents to be around.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Both campaigns trying hard to appeal to young people. President Obama said Jay-Z on his iPod. In an effort to keep up, Mitt Romney said he downloaded Nickelback to his Zune.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a campaign insider, Mitt Romney is looking to pick a, quote, 'incredibly boring, white guy' for his running mate. Which explains why, today, Mitt Romney announced his support for cloning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a new interview, Jay-Z said that President Obama should get credit for turning the economy around. It's true. Back when Obama took office, Jay-Z actually had 100 problems. Now, it's gone down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of President Obama, he just raised $1 million at a fund-raiser hosted by Ricky Martin. Obama thanked Martin for his contribution to the campaign, while Joe Biden thanked him for his contribution to Menudo.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former President George W. Bush has broken his silence. He was on an elevator the other day and as the doors were closing he said to a reporter [in a low voice ] 'I'm for Mitt Romney.' Another ringing endorsement. Oh, President Bush also said that he believes this presidential race between Romney and Obama is going to come down to election day. Look at that. Yeah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new poll by the 'New York Times,' Mitt Romney now has a small lead over President Obama. Which proves once and for all money can't buy you happiness, but it comes in handy when you're running for President.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, and President Obama released his financial disclosure statement today. It turns out he is now worth over $10 million. So at least somebody is doing well in this economy, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of that, let's see what's going on with JPMorgan, or as investors call them, WTF Morgan. You hear about this? The Justice Department has launched a probe into JPMorgan's $2.3 billion loss. A government probe. I believe that's called Operation Wink, Nod And Look The Other Way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama calling for more government reform after that $2 billion loss. Really? Is that what you need? The government stepping in? You know what's going to happen here? The government's going to teach them how to lose $2 billion a day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;George W. Bush, good old George W. Bush endorsed Mitt Romney. I understand George W. Bush coming out for Mitt Romney, because President Obama, if you think about it, has really done a terrible job of cleaning up the mess Bush made.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It took a lot guts for George W. Bush to endorse Mitt Romney, it took a lot of guts to endorse the Mitt, the Mittster, especially when all the other candidates dropped out. It took a lot of guts to step forward and say, I'll tell you something-- Bush said not only does Romney have my support but he can also have my crooked Florida voting machines.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The 'Newsweek cover. You may not have heard about this. It features a picture of President Obama with the caption 'The First Gay President.' Yeah, when he heard this Obama said 'I miss the good ol' days when they just called me a Muslim.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new poll found that Mitt Romney is actually ahead of President Obama among female voters. Which explains Obama's new slogan, 'I'm Barack Obama and I Love &quot;50 Shades of Grey.&quot;'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of Mitt Romney there are reports that he may attend the London Olympics this summer. Yeah, Romney's psyched to watch wrestling because it's the only place where someone changes positions more than he does.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Mitt Romney picked up another high profile endorsement yesterday from former President George W. Bush. A reporter from ABC News asked who he was supporting, and as the doors to the elevator were closing, he said, 'I'm for Mitt Romney.' Then he tried to give a thumb's up, but it got caught in the door. Then today Herman Cain endorsed Mitt Romney. But this is possibly very important because as goes Herman Cain, so go the other two black Republicans in America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Meanwhile little Ron Paul made an announcement on Monday, saying he's dropping out of the race for President. This was his third race for President. He ran in 2008 against John McCain and against Lincoln in 1860, I believe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;I'm sure by now you've seen the cover of 'Newsweek,' which names President Obama the first gay president. Well, I think Chester A. Arthur might have a few things to say about that.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As I'm sure you heard by now, 'Newsweek' magazine has President Obama on the cover this week, calling him the 'first gay President.' Actually, that's not true. Historians say that James Buchanan was probably our first gay President. He was a bachelor; he lived for 15 years with Alabama Senator William Rufus King, and was briefly married to Liza Minnelli.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know, you think Greece is in bad shape -- oh, my God. How bad is California? Governor Brown says we're $16 billion in debt. In fact, California is so broke, the guy who delivers Chinese food to me is now car pooling with the guy who brings me Domino's Pizza. That's how bad. California is so broke, down in Anaheim; Snow White was just arrested for solicitation. You hate to see that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what, ladies and gentlemen, anybody got any money? Anybody got any money, folks? I got no money. And you know a couple of three years ago we went through the banks exploded and nobody had any money. And so now President Barack Obama has got to make his financial records public. Listen to this, Barack Obama, President of the United States lives in the White House. So we know he's not paying rent. He's worth $8 million. Yup. So at least his economic recovery is on track.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney hears Barack Obama is worth $8 million. And you know what Mitt Romney says, he goes 'Hell, I got that on me.' One time Mitt Romney actually lost $8 million. Turned out he left it in his other pants.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't know if you heard this but California Governor Jerry Brown said the state is $16 billion in debt. He said it in a speech called 'Seriously, Let's Legalize Pot.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During a speech yesterday in Ohio, Joe Biden criticized Republicans for not understanding the middle class. In response, Mitt Romney was like, 'That's ridiculous. Some of my best friend's gardeners are middle class.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, and a week after JPMorgan announced they lost $2 billion, which has now been raised to $3 billion. ... Yeah, they lost $3 billion.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you see a man passing a hat in the audience tonight it's just governor Jerry Brown trying to balance the budget in California. Just give generously. Folks, Jerry Brown says California is now $16 billion in debt. In fact, the state is so broke; teachers in California are now having sex with their students just to get the lunch money. California is so broke, In-N-Out Burger is now Down-N-Out Burger. Beverly Hills is so broke, I saw a woman tanning in the sun!

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, some good Washington gossip. Al Gore has a new girlfriend. Apparently, it's getting pretty serious. He's already been over to bore her parents. In fact, they were spotted taking long walks on the beach, measuring how much the sea is rising. So apparently, it's very serious.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama gave the commencement speech at Barnard College the other day. He told graduates their future is bright, unless they want jobs. Then you're kind of screwed. But other than that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney answered a reporter's question the other day by saying, 'I'm not familiar precisely with exactly what I said. But I stand by what I said, whatever it was.' Well, there's a campaign slogan you can believe in, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway. Mitt Romney's campaign said he is still deciding his position on immigration. He's still deciding. I mean, the guy's been running for President for what, six years now, something like that? How much more time you need? In fact, I understand any day now he's going to give a decision on whether that Berlin Wall should come down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to 'Forbes' magazine Mitt Romney has $230 million on him, on him. He has that on him, ladies and gentlemen. This guy has got so much money his wallet has a pullout handle and wheels.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see this today? President Obama tossed around a football at Soldier Field, home of the Chicago bears. Yep, Obama told Biden to go long. Then, he hopped into his car and drove away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Get this. A new study found out that most members of Congress can only speak at a tenth grade level. In response, congress issued a statement saying, 'That is totes ridonkulous.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Shares of the Facebook stock dropped from the opening day price of $38 to around $34 today, which added up to a loss. They say if it drops any lower, Mitt Romney will swoop in and divide it up into face and book.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What a weekend it was for Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. After Facebook's stock went public on Friday, his net worth was estimated at $20 billion. Then on Saturday, he got married, which means someday his net worth could be $10 billion. ... In fact, Facebook has lost so much money, Mark Zuckerberg has been named an honorary board member of JPMorgan. So that's really good.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's an interesting thing. According to a study released today, the average member of Congress can only speak at a tenth grade level -- which is worse than it sounds, because the average tenth grader speaks at a third grade level.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, congratulations, to former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. The city of San Francisco has named a street after her today. It's called Botox Avenue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Obama snubbed the President of Pakistan at the NATO summit in Chicago this week. Obama pretended that the Pakistani president wasn't even there.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is interesting. In Mexico a female politician is running campaign ads that feature her topless. Yeah. I just want to say, if this is the way things are headed, I am really happy that Newt Gingrich is out of the race.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, you see this? Police in South Dakota arrested a 53-year-old man formerly from Chicago who's trying to climb on to Mt. Rushmore. The guy is in his 50s, from Chicago, desperate to get on Mt. Rushmore. Oh, my God, it's Obama. Oh, my God.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And just two weeks after a felon in jail got 41% of the Democratic vote in West Virginia, President Obama got embarrassed again in Arkansas yesterday when an unknown lawyer got 42%. See, that proves once and for all, there's only 1% difference between a lawyer and a convicted felon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, over the past few months, there's been an increasing buzz that Mitt Romney will pick a Vice President who's safe, white and duller than him. Which pretty much narrows it down to a piece of chalk, doesn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, the big gossip in Washington, Al Gore has a new girlfriend. You know how they met? Kind of embarrassing. I guess she was on some kind of nature hike, went to hug a tree, it was Al.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it looks like there's yet another Colombian hooker scandal. This time it involves the DEA. According to reports, members of the DEA are now under investigation for hiring prostitutes while they were in Colombia. See, apparently the DEA investigation has been going on for quite some time, but very quietly. Members of Congress have known about it, but were asked not to say anything until the investigation was complete. And believe me, when it comes to keeping quiet about hookers, Congress are experts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, four of the Secret Service agents who were fired for that sex scandal, well they decided to fight their dismissal. They're fighting their dismissal. One of their arguments is -- this is what the lawyer said -- they didn't realize the women were prostitutes. Is that the best argument when you're trying to get your job back in the Secret Service? I mean, these guys are supposed to be experts at picking people out of a crowd.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Next month a new biography is going to come out about the life of 300-pound New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. The biography is called 'Are You Going To Finish That?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's an election update. Today, Mitt Romney met with a group of wealthy Latino business owners, or as Romney calls them, the Juan percent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you guys see this? A restaurant in Texas is rewarding customers who place their order in Spanish with a free pizza. While the restaurant in Arizona is rewarding customers who do that with a free trip back to Mexico.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And finally, after losing billions of dollars, Mark Zuckerberg is being sued for hiding Facebook's weak financial report. Yep, apparently he put it somewhere no one will ever look -- MySpace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;There has been another new development in the Secret Service scandal, four of the agents who were let go are trying to have their dismissals overturned. They claimed they're being used as scapegoats because there's an unwritten code that says you can get drunk and have sex with women in other countries. Internally they refer to it as the 'secret circus,' which explains why they were trying to pay the hookers peanuts. Just because you're pitching a tent doesn't make it a circus. Unfortunately the scandal is expanding. Now several DEA agents, it's a whole other thing, are being scrutinized for allegedly soliciting prostitutes in Cartagena. ... Here's what it comes down to for me. If you want to have one-night stands or hire a bunch of hookers, fine. Just don't sign up to protect our politicians. If that's the thing you want to do, become one of our politicians.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the Center for Responsive Politics reports that President Obama has become the first politician in history to raise $1 billion in his political career.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, how stupid is this? Arizona Secretary of State, a guy named Ken Bennett dispatched two deputies to Hawaii so they can investigate whether or not President Obama's birth certificate is real. Well, the deputies reported not only is the birth certificate real, but their boss is a real moron.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to 'The LA Times,' Mitt Romney trying very, very hard to win over Hispanic voters. He's even adopted a Spanish nickname -- Senor Mucho Dinero.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I love this. Donald Trump says he would be Mitt Romney's perfect choice as a running mate. They do have one thing in common. They are both famous for saying 'You're fired,' a lot. They both tell people that. How many would like to see Donald Trump as Vice President? How many would rather see Romney get his old high school buddies together, gang up on Trump, and cut off all of his hair?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At an event in Monaco, at a casino in Monaco, former President Bill Clinton posed for pictures with his arms around two women, both of whom turned out to be famous porn stars. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Democratic candidate for Congress right here in California, a man named Andy Caffery says if he wins, he will smoke a joint right on the steps of Capitol Hill. And adding that if he has to, he will even get arrested. So in other words, if he's elected, he'll take taxpayer money, get high and not get anything done. Hey, welcome to Congress. He should fit in just fine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new study shows current members of Congress speak at a 10th grade level. That's true. They speak at a 10th grade level. When reached for comment, Eric Cantor said, 'Nuh-uh!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Former President Clinton had quite a night last night. He was with celebrities at a charity event called Nights in Monaco. While he was there, he posed for a picture with these women who, it turns out, are porn stars. ... Some people are wondering how they got a picture with a former President? That's not what I'm wondering. I'm wondering, how has this never happened before? I don't think we should criticize him.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, it was Memorial Day yesterday. I hope you had the traditional cookout with good friends, good laughs, cold beer and sober reflections on the grim tally of two centuries of war. And, of course, vodka watermelon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But there was some disturbing news over the break. Barack Obama is still President. Or is he? Because real estate billionaire and basketball with tooth veneers Donald Trump has found new evidence that Barack Obama was not born in Hawaii. No surprise to me. I always found that whole Hawaii thing pretty implausible. By that I mean, the state of Hawaii. And their word for hello is the same as goodbye?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is official -- after 28 years, $2 trillion, and three unsolved murders later, Wilbeerdink Cummerbund Romney will be the Republican presidential nominee or Rominee. ... I guess that's it. The Coney Island mermaid's parade that was the Republican primaries is done.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[On Trump's birther claims] &quot;I might as well resign myself to the long slog to November with no ray of light or hope. Comedy gods? Is that you? Do you have something for me? ... Could it be? No! In my despair over not having good election material, have the comedy gods delivered unto me a Trump-o-gram? Let's see what's inside. Oh! Thank you, Gilda Radner, George Carlin and Richard Pryor. On the day that Romney celebrates clinching the Republican nomination, he also holds a fundraiser with reality show host and antique doll hair thief Donald Trump, giving Trump an excuse to do phone interviews on not one, not two, but three separate cable news networks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, we've got to come up with a commonsense solution to our poorest southern border. That's why I have long called for a 200,000-mile-long border wall made out of 10-foot-tall rotating razor blades that will slice illegals up like deli meat. ... Folks, there is one Mexican cartel I grudgingly respect. It is Mexico's Knight's Templar, who draw inspiration from the medieval Christian warriors of the same name who muled, of course, frankincense-filled condoms into Jerusalem until they were busted by Joan of Narc.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Next up, folks, Mitt Romney won the Texas Republican primary last night, crossing the crucial 1,144 delegate threshold. Yes, what a story! He came from never being behind to clinch the Republican nomination. They said it could be done. And against no odds, he achieved the possible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who does need help spelling? Mitt Romney. His campaign put out a smart-phone app today. This is true. I didn't make this up. And, on the day of the national spelling bee, they put out an app. Some of the audience are unsure where the spelling mistake is. Look. I think it looks fine. What the hell? 'A Better Amer-CIA.' Romney supporters say that anyone who points out the mistake is un-Amer-cian. Poor guy obviously can't afford spell check. But I think the Romney campaign can spell America any way they want to.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wow, Mayor Bloomberg. Wow. I love this idea you have of banning sodas larger than 16 ounces. It combines the draconian government overreach people love with the probable lack of results they expect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And what do you do about Slurpees? What do you do about Slurpees, huh? A drink that lives in the nether world betwixt physical states.

Oh, but that's right the Slurpee is fine because they're sold in convenience stores and that's not regulated because-- it's magic.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obesity is the problem now? Fine, I think I know how to solve it. Reintroduce crack. It may be whack, but when that weight comes off, it stays off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now folks, we all know that Barack Obama has been working hard to kill our economy. But it turns out there is something he's working even harder to kill. We took out Al Qaeda's number two. And it's not the first time. In 2011, 2008 and 2006 we also took out Al Qaeda's number twos. Right now that must be kind of a tough position to fill. 'A promotion to number two? Oh, Mr. Al-Zawahiri, I'm flattered, but I promised I would coach my son's team and it's my turn to bring the headless goat carcass.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now Al Qaeda operatives aren't just afraid to move up, they're afraid to look up. Because Obama has carried out more than five times as many covert drone strikes as George Bush. So what's behind the President's righteous kill spree? Could it be he's just gunning for another Nobel Peace Prize? Good luck, sir. Or could it be moral authority? You see, the President campaigned on a promise that he would shut down the prison at Guantanamo but that turned out to be real hard. So, rather than sending prisoners to Gitmo, he is taking the high road by sending them to their maker. As 'The New York Times' puts it, 'Mr. Obama has avoided the complication of detention by deciding to take no prisoners alive.' It's brilliant. He doesn't have to worry about habeas corpus because after a drone strike, sometimes you can't even find the corpus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only problem is, the only problem is, folks, occasionally our drones kill civilians. But you know what they say? 'To make an omelet, you got to kill a few civilians.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes. Obama gets baseball cards with pictures and stats on suspected terrorists, and of course a stick of stale gum which he gives to Biden. Eventually, eventually the process must work because a senior Administration official said that 'The number of civilians killed if drone strikes in Pakistan under Mr. Obama was in the single digits.' That's impressive. Because those bombs are huge. And the Administration has developed a brilliant system for ensuring that those building-engulfing explosions don't kill noncombatants. They just count all military-aged males in a strike zone as combatants. They reason that Al Qaeda is an isolated maniacal group, so anyone with them is probably Al Qaeda. The same way that anyone at Comiccon is probably a virgin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, this isn't just the President executing innocent people around the world by fiat. There is an appeals process. The men are considered terrorists unless there is explicit intelligence posthumously proving them innocent. In which case, I assume, there is a legal process that unkills them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mayor Bloomberg is cracking down on the most dangerous threat to the Big Apple. Sodas. It's true! He wants to outlaw sodas and other sugary drinks over 16 ounces. On the streets of Manhattan, people were enraged, yelling, shaking their fists. Then they found out about this soda ban.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Slime ball John Edwards found not guilty on the one corruption charge, and the other five charges against him were dismissed because of a mistrial. But, you know, I don't think he learned his lesson. You know, three of the jurors are now pregnant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Outside the courthouse, John Edwards said he knows who's responsible for his problems. And he says he doesn't have to go any farther than the mirror. And if you know John Edwards, he's never far from a mirror.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But anyway, now that -- now that Edwards is a free man, he said he's looking forward to spending time with his family and then sneaking behind their backs and starting another new family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to an NBC/ 'Wall Street Journal' poll, single women prefer President Obama over Mitt Romney by 36 points. And of course, Romney now doing anything he can to win women over. You see him today? He was driving around with Ryan Gosling strapped to the roof of his car.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's a nice story. A fifth-grader who skipped school so he could see President Obama give a speech at his dad's factory was afraid he'd get in trouble. So, the President gave him a handwritten note on White House stationery excusing him from class. How cool is that? Unfortunately, the teacher thought it was fake and demanded to see the long-form version of the note.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to a new book coming out by a Pulitzer Prize winning author, apparently when he was in high school, President Obama smoked large amounts of marijuana. You know what that means? He could be our first green President. That's pretty impressive. And I guess there were a lot of pictures and wild stories, and now people are asking how did reporters miss this story back in 2008? I'm guessing they were high, too. Well, according to this book, they say whenever a joint was making the rounds, President Obama often elbowed his way in and shouted, 'Interception,' and would take an extra hit. And, ironically, when his friends said everyone should get an equal share, he called them socialists. So, I don't know what to think about that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unemployment's still looking pretty bad. In fact, the White House has a new slogan on jobs creation ? 'Hope and Change the Subject.' I believe that's it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, the economy, it is hurting. These unemployment numbers are higher than President Obama was in high school. That's how bad. In fact, the economy is so bad, people in Beverly Hills are learning Spanish just so they can fire the help. That's how bad. The economy is so bad in the valley, Bruce Jenner is keeping his face another year. That's how bad it is. And Hollywood is hurting, too. Things are so bad on 'Sesame Street,' all the Muppets are living in trash cans now. That's how bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to New York City. Now what you may not know about New York City is we've got a guy named Mayor Bloomberg who is the mayor. The only public official who has been in office longer than Mayor Bloomberg is Santa. And now, Mayor Bloomberg has outlawed smoking. Okay, we'll give him that one. We don't want people smoking. Outlawed salt; you can't have salt in your food. Outlawed transfats. Okay. Well, I'll give him that one too. We don't want transfats. You can't get giant sodas any more thanks to Mayor Bloomberg.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A couple of days ago it came out Mitt Romney is in fact a wealthy man. You know, we weren't sure. We weren't quite sure if he was really wealthy. Now the truth is out. On Friday, Mitt Romney disclosed his earnings. He is worth between $190 million and $250 million. Yeah. Romney says there's a $60 million discrepancy because there's still one pair of jeans where he hasn't checked the pockets. He'll get back to us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are wondering who his [Mitt Romney's] running mate will be. Some are urging him to choose a Latino running mate. Romney said he's torn between his gardener and his other gardener. He's just not sure. He's got to think about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Guards at Guantanamo Bay apparently tried to coerce inmates into giving information by playing the inmates songs from 'Sesame Street.' And it worked. O ne prisoner broke down and confessed, 'Rubber ducky, he's the one!'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Friday, President Obama spent the night at his home in Chicago for the first time in over a year. It was nice. He even went down to the basement, dusted off some old campaign promises. He was like, 'This one got me Delaware.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's right. Obama spent the night at his home in Chicago. Of course, it got awkward when he left, and his housekeeper was like, 'So, see you after the election?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are reports that US intelligence officials used children's songs to torture suspected terrorists. Which explains the one terrorist who was like, 'All right, all right. I'll tell you how to get to Sesame Street!'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I saw that Joe Biden's daughter got married this weekend. Isn't that nice? That's very nice. That's right.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new report shows that Congress might be getting dumber. The Sunlight Foundation analyzed recent speeches made by members of Congress and found that they are speaking at the level expected of a sophomore in high school. In the same study seven years ago, Congress was speaking at the level of a junior in high school. Congress is so dumb that it took them seven years just to be held back a grade. Nation this is outrageous. And for you dim-bulb Congressman watching, 'outrageous' is a big word meaning Stephen surprisey frown. Full range of emotion. America's leaders are speaking like high school sophomores. A silent language of angry glares at the dinner table between text messages. ... Nation, I'm an anti-government guy. But if we're paying these clowns, I say we should get something for our money. They should talk in a fancy way that shows more respect for the sacred institutions I have no respect for.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have a fantastic announcement. Some good news. Forget the Mayans. According to NASA, the world will not come to an end for another 4 billion years. Or about the same time your 401K comes back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Listen to this. Mitt Romney has released his financial disclosure records. Some surprises -- for example, did you know some of his money is in an American bank? I was stunned to learn.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And on his way to a campaign event, rocker Bon Jovi got to ride to New York on Air Force One with President Obama. See, Bon Jovi riding on Air Force One with the President, that's pretty cool. Joe Biden, he had to drive up in a van with the guys who sang 'Who Let The Dogs Out?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the number two guy in Al Qaeda has been killed. Who says Obama isn't creating job openings, huh? There's a job opening. There's a job for somebody. ... Anyway, Abu Yahya killed in a drone strike yesterday. See, I think we've got them scared. I mean, when Al Qaeda's number three heard what happened to Al Qaeda's number two, he went number one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How awkward must it be to get a promotion in Al Qaeda? 'Johnson, come in here. How'd you like to be the new face of Al Qaeda? Full partner, big office, more visibility.' 'I'm gonna stay in the mail room, boss. I'm fine. Don't really wanna be out there.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;California's debt crisis getting worse and worse. Oh, my God, I'll tell you how broke we are. I was in the valley today, saw a 99 cent meth lab. That's how bad. Terrible. The economy in California is so bad if it was a network, it would be NBC. That's how bad. The economy is so bad, President Obama's switched from smoking pot to huffing paint. That's how bad. Terrible. Terrible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After Detroit police and an EMS worker said that a 59-year-old man died of natural causes, a mortician said he had a gunshot wound to the chest. Well, technically they're both right. Because in Detroit, getting shot is dying of natural causes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, guess who's gay? That's right. The Green Lantern from the comic books. Green Lantern. And today, Mitt Romney knocked him down and shaved his head.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I had a terrible nightmare last night. I dreamed that I was a union member in Wisconsin who loved the Miami Heat. It was a nightmare. Well, Governor Scott Walker won his recall last night in Wisconsin. Who would have guessed the Governor of Wisconsin would have been a better closer than Lebron James?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Looks like the government may soon have yet another way to squeeze more money out of us. Listen to what they want to do it here. Several states are now conducting pilot programs testing cars equipped with GPS tracking devices in hopes they can eventually monitor and tax us for every mile we drive. You would get taxed by the mile. You know what we should do? Let's put a tracking device on the money we send the government. This will be easy. How much goes to hookers, and how much goes to -- let's just make it a two-way street. Make it a two-way street.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And CNBC is reporting that America lost 129,000 millionaires last year. Or as Mitt Romney calls them, an endangered species we have to protect. We have to protect these people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, a new book out claims that Barack Obama smoked a lot of marijuana while he was in high school. You know, if I had to choose a candidate I thought that was smoking a lot of dope, I would have to go with Romney. No, I mean he's the one with a short-term memory. Remember he's the one that said, 'I don't know exactly what I said, but I stand by what I said. Whatever it was.' Doesn't that sound like the guy that's high?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a Democratic candidate for Congress right here in California, man named Andy Capri, says if he wins the election, he will smoke a joint on the steps of Capitol Hill. And if he has to, he will even get arrested. Finally a politician that makes a promise he can actually keep.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Defense Department announced that Al Qaeda's number-two man -- and that is a job that they keep having to fill over and over and over again -- because the second they bump number three up to number two -- bingo!

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Is this crazy -- someone hacked into Mitt Romney's email account? Did you hear this? They hacked into his email account after correctly guessing the answer to his security question. They guessed it. Apparently the question was: 'Who was your first grade teacher?' and Romney responded, 'Who cares? I've got $200 million.' This is the crazy thing. It was revealed Mitt Romney's email address is mittromney@hotmail.com That's true. The guy who's trying so hard to prove he's in touch is still using hotmail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A big election story, you guys. It's been reported that Mitt Romney's personal hotmail account has been hacked. Yeah. Hotmail. Even Ron Paul was like, 'Get with it, you old geezer.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of Mitt Romney, his campaign is in the news for misspelling several words on his promotional items. Today, Romney issued a press release, he said, 'I'll get to the bottom of this or my name isn't Malt Ramrod.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Back in 2010, conservative Republican Scott walker was elected Governor of Wisconsin by a margin of 52-46. It wasn't long before Walker slashed budgets and constrained unions and did the kind of things you would imagine conservative Republican politicians would do. So, the people of Wisconsin said 'Whoa! Wait! What? What? You never said you were going to be this conservative Republican-y.' They moved to recall him like a lead-painted toy made in a nonunion Chinese sweatshop. ... Yes, the people have spoken saying, 'Oh, I'm sorry; you didn't hear us the first time? Yeah, yeah, we said we liked the tyrant-y union cutting guy. He's our guy. Like we said 16 months ago.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, as you know Wisconsin governor and only boy in homeroom not to receive a valentine Scott Walker faced a recall against Milwaukee Mayor I Can't Remember His Name. The recall was sparked by last year's massive protests over Walker eliminating collective bargaining for teachers unions. Well, the results are in and Walker crushed what's-his-face by seven points! Suck it, people who educate our children!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, there was another drone attack ordered by the White House last night. Another drone attack. They sent Joe Biden out to give a speech. Yeah, just droning on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Qaeda's number two man was killed by an American drone earlier this week. I'm thinking, now, what is this -- like the 20th number two guy? You know how buildings over here never have a 13th floor because it's unlucky? Maybe Al Qaeda should just have a number one and a number three guy because this number two thing is just not working out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And there were some tense moments yesterday during President Obama's visit to Los Angeles. Three private planes drifted into his restricted air space. And as you know, the President's restricted air space can only be penetrated by people donating more than $35,000.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it's coming down the wire for Mitt Romney. He's got to think about picking a Vice President pretty soon. And it's kind of a tough situation because political pundits say he needs to select a running mate that is duller than he is. The only problem is that guy is already Vice President.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, Mayor Bloomberg has outlawed, banned giant cans of soda, giant soda, ladies and gentlemen. People, when you outlaw stuff it creates crime. You know that, right? I saw a guy today he's walking down the street and a cop is arresting him because he's got a huge soda and he said 'No, no, this is medicinal Mountain Dew, I can have it. I can have this.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it happened again, you know, in Al Qaeda they're in trouble because after we got rid of Osama bin Laden then they keep moving number two guy up. And so if you are number two, I mean your days are numbered. A drone hit the new number two. ... And I'm telling you, these Al Qaeda leaders, they don't last as long as a Kardashian marriage, you know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Joe Biden's wife, Jill Biden, has written a children's book. Isn't that nice? It's called 'Green Eggs and Help, My Husband Won't Stop Talking.' That doesn't even rhyme.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney's nonstop Secret Service protection is apparently bothering the people who live near his beach house. Romney had a lot of questions about the complaint, such as, 'Which beach house?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just saw that President Obama is spending $12 million on a one-minute commercial hitting Mitt Romney's business record. Though Obama's made some bad business moves, too, like spending $12 million for a one-minute commercial. What are you doing? What are you doing? Is it CGI? Is Shrek coming out in this commercial?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former GOP candidate Rick Santorum -- you guys remember him. He said he's going to make a big announcement tomorrow. Yep. It will probably be something really huge like, 'Hello, shoppers, we got a two for one sale on Tide in aisle five. You want to check that out. There's a five limit -- five Tide limit.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, you know, we have a complicated relationship with Pakistan. It's sort of a love hate relationship. They love to hate us. And we hate that we have to love them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's no secret that I'm not a fan of the 'New York Times.' Just check out how deep in the tank these guys are for Barack Obama. Just today they did a hit job on Mitt Romney in the home section. Look at that. ... Front page, above the fold, massive article, slamming Mitt Romney's $12 million mansion in La Jolla, California. For which the Times devoted several days of interviews with about a dozen of Mitt's neighbors learning all the salacious details like the 'elderly woman next door complains that her car is constantly boxed into her driveway.' Oh no, Mitt kept a cranky old lady from driving? Now who will plow into our farmers markets? The article goes on to say that 'down the street a widow grouses that her children's favorite dog-walking route has been disrupted.' A widow? Oh, thank you for that by no means emotionally manipulative detail, 'New York Times.' What's wrong? You couldn't you find a blind orphan for him to have tripped? Besides, what is she complaining about? If her dog needs to go out, Mitt will be more than happy to strap it to the roof of his car.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, let's see what's going on in the world. Hey, in an event celebrating her 25th anniversary of being elected to Congress, Nancy Pelosi revealed that the ghost of past feminist leaders spoke to her at her first White House meeting as speaker. And a related story -- doctors now say, 'Yes, botox can cause hallucinations.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Guantanamo Bay detention center is now undergoing millions of dollars of upgrades that include a new soccer field, cable TV, enriching your life classes for the detainees that include learning to paint and writing a r?sum?. Why do they need a r?sum?? Who's going to hire these guys? 'Oh, terrorist with Al Qaeda.' 'Yes?' 'We could use someone like you in customer service.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, remember when Obama was campaigning? Didn't he say he was going to close Guantanamo Bay? Didn't he say that? Apparently, he just meant for renovations, yeah. Just renovating it, that's all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in the White House press conference earlier today, President Obama was asked about the economy. The President said the economy is doing fine. In fact, over 14 million people were able to watch it while sitting at home because they're unemployed. So, they saw that today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to 'The New York Times,' one of Mitt Romney's San Diego neighbors isn't thrilled to have the presidential candidate living next door. This guy just sitting on his steps smoking a joint. And Romney comes over and tells him, 'Hey, stop smoking marijuana!' That's what he told him. 'Stop smoking marijuana.' Hey, he's lucky Obama's not his neighbor. He would have to share it. So, I don't know which is...I don't know which is worse. Don't know which is worse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, do you know about this? According to a new book that's coming out, allegedly, President Obama smoked a lot of marijuana while he was in high school. And friends say he did it to escape his troubles. Well, how big a joint is he smoking now?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Boy, here's something that amazes me. Remember the tsunami in Japan last year? Of course you do. Well, this week in Oregon, a 60-foot piece of dock washed ashore. A dock came across the whole -- washed ashore in Oregon. The most amazing part, three Cubans were standing on it. That's the amazing ? they made it all the way ? all the way, amazing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in Greece, the unemployment rate has risen to twenty-two percent. Twenty-two percent. The solution to the problem was to raise taxes on the rich, according to the Greek president Barack Obamaopolis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah. And New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg says it should be all right for someone to carry a small amount of marijuana. Marijuana's okay. Now, this announcement comes on the heels of his plan to ban large sugary drinks in his fight against obesity. So, he's okay with you getting high, just don't want you drinking that Slurpee after you're stoned, you know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's some political news, political news here. Yesterday on CNN, Bill Clinton said he' s very sorry for going against President Obama's campaign messages. Obama said it was humbling to hear Clinton apologize. Then Hillary was like, 'Trust me, you get used to it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of President Obama, this weekend his daughter Sasha will turn 11 years old. Yep. Sasha ? yep. Eleven years old. Sasha didn't ask Obama for a present, you know, because she's still waiting for him to deliver the gift he promised three birthdays ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You guys, there's a report that Mitt Romney used to dress up as a police officer in high school and pull over drivers for speeding. Of course, people knew something was up when they noticed that they were being pulled over by a limo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some international news. On Wednesday, North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un spoke at a rally for more than 20,000 children. Yeah, he said if the kids just buckle down and study hard they could be anything he wants them to be.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, here's a guy I forgot about, Ron Paul, you know Ron Paul and then his, yeah, he's still running somewhere. And his son now has endorsed Mitt Romney. So, Ron Paul's son is a senator from Kentucky -- had him on the show. And he's now endorsing, instead of his father, he's endorsing -- I said, 'Ouch' when ' I know how it feels. My son watches Jay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of money, you're not going it to believe this. Last month Mitt Romney, Mitty, Mitten, Mitt Romney raised $76 million. Seventy ? yeah, impressive, right? Here's what happened. He found it in an old sport coat pocket. 'Hey, what a minute. Hey look at there.' And you know what he did with that money? He took Warren Buffett to lunch. That's exactly what he did with that money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, they keep telling us that Mitt Romney is not the stiff, lack of personality. You know, a lot of people say that the guy has no personality. And I looked into it. And the reason people say that about him is its true.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, they're chronicling now episodes to indicate that Mitt Romney in fact has a personality. Now listen to this, when he was a kid in high school, his father, as you may recall, was the governor of Michigan. Mitt Romney, here is what he liked to do. He had his own state trooper uniform. He asked his dad, 'Dad, would it be all right?' 'Yeah, don't worry son, I'll bring you one. I'll get you one. Sure we'll get you a state trooper outfit.' So, Mitt had his state trooper outfit. They got the kid a red light that he would put on the top of his car. And for fun, what Mitt would like to do is get dressed up like a trooper, put the red light on and go out and pull over motorists. All right, everybody say it with me. Ladies and gentlemen, it's like I have a twin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He would dress up like a state trooper and go out pulling over cars. 'Are you old enough to be a state trooper, son?' 'Yes, yes, I am. Let me see your license and registration, please. Going kind of fast, weren't you?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, now the, the debate, the president, it's really running hot now because over the weekend, I guess Friday or something, President Obama said that the private sector was 'doing fine.' What about it -- are we doing fine, are we not doing fine? Yeah, we could do a little better, don't you think? 'Fine' may not be the exact word to describe how the private sector is doing, you know. Hopeful, maybe we're hopeful. Maybe we're less pessimistic than we used to be. I don't know if 'fine' is the word.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well anyway, Mitt Romney jumped right on this and wasted no time issuing this response to President Obama saying that the private sector is fine. Watch what Mitt had to say.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unidentified speaker: &quot;After President Obama made this statement...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama, President of the United States: &quot;The private sector is doing fine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unidentified speaker: &quot;Mitt Romney quickly responded.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney,: &quot;He said the private sector is doing fine. Is he really that out of touch?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unidentified speaker: &quot;While speaking from the hot tub of his luxury yacht on another yacht next to a private island that is part of his chain of islands on his own planet, Mitt Romney in touch with the common man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Mitt Romney in touch with the common man! There's the common man right there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Rand Paul ? do you know who Rand Paul is? He is son of Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul, who has not dropped out of the race yet, by the way. Well, Rand Paul has now endorsed Mitt Romney. That's going to make for an awkward Father's Day this Sunday, doesn't it? Huh? Whoo. 'Hey, pop, what do you want for Father's Day?' 'I don't know, a little support might be nice.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood has introduced a new initiative he calls 'blueprint for ending distracted driving.' It's a pretty good plan. I read it on my iPad coming in this morning. Got some good ideas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, did you hear about this? US Commerce Secretary John Bryson has been cited for felony hit and run after he crashed into a car. Exchanged information with the guy. Backed into the car, took off. Drove away, hit another car. He said he had a seizure. That's what he said, he had a seizure. To which Lindsay Lohan said, 'Why didn't I think of that? I had a seizure. Of course, that's what I ? I had a seizure!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new Gallup poll, people in the Middle East lead the world in negative emotions. Well, duh. Any time people are lining up to be suicide bombers, they're probably not in a happy place.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's trouble in Washington. I don't know if you know about this. Somebody has been leaking classified information. Classified information. Security secrets. Somebody is leaking that information. John McCain, who's nothing if not a bulldog, is outraged. He is furious. He wants to get to the bottom of who is leaking the classified information and also he wants to find out who keeps messing with his thermostat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And now there's a big fight in the Republican Party between Jeb Bush and Grover Norquist. So, big fight between Jeb and Grover. What is this, 'The Beverly Hillbillies?' I mean, for the love of God! What are we talking about?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, Mitt Romney, Mittty, Mitten, our buddy, is going on a six-state bus tour and Mitt is very excited because he's never been on a bus! So, Mitt Romney is going with his lovely wife Mrs. Mitt and the kids, Mitty and Mitt Jr., will be with the dog riding on the roof of the bus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt says that President Obama is out of touch. Out of touch. Mitt says President Obama's out of touch. I think Mitt May be out of touch with what out of touch means.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I just love this. Mitt is a guy who, I don't know. He's one of those guys that having him around is like not having him around.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People say, 'Oh, if you don't know the real Mitt, he's a crazy guy.' When Mitt was a kid, he would, I hate stuff like this. His dad, who was the governor of Michigan -- and I'm from Indiana and to think this was going on in a neighboring state. His dad got him a state trooper's uniform. 'Here you go, Mitty, put it on, buddy!' And so, Mitt would dress up like a state trooper and he would take the family sedan, the Cadillac, and go out and he had a thing, a siren and light, and he would pull over innocent motorists. It sounds like the beginning of a pornographic movie. 'All right, get out of the car, put your hands on the hood, get out of the cars.' He also liked to dress up like the Lone Ranger. There he is right there, hey, Mitty! Hey, Mitty! Couldn't afford the mask.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a great day for America, everybody. It's actually a very nice day for one of my very dear friends, Betty White, who met with the President today at the White House. Imagine that. The most powerful person on the planet meeting the President of the United States. President Obama invited Betty personally because she's great with animals. And the President's still having a tough time house-training Joe Biden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Betty...she was very happy to be there. She hasn't been in the Oval Office since the time she hooked up with Clinton. 'Betty, thank you for being a friend with benefits.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Listen, the doom-criers can say what they want. I think you people just proved that there is no energy crisis. We ought to frack you. And I mean in the best possible way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, we all see the news. Last week's jobs report was miserable. The economy is not getting any better. Our relationship with nuclear Pakistan has never been more tense and Europe is on the verge of collapse. And you know what that means? Things are looking up for Mitt Romney. And, folks, the old Romney luck continues!&quot; Unidentified speaker: &quot;The Romneys might be going to the Olympics. A horse Anne Romney co-owns came in third in an Olympic qualifying event.&quot; Colbert: &quot;The Romneys' horse might go to the Olympics! Though one would imagine it's going to be a long drive to London on top of their station wagon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Their horse, Rafalca, is competing at the United States Equestrian Federation National Dressage championships in Gladstone, New Jersey. As if you don't know from your equestrian fantasy league.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, folks, this is exactly what Mitt needs! He's had a little trouble relating to Joe six-pack. Listen to him talking about basketball. Mitt Romney, Republican presidential candidate: &quot;I met a guy yesterday, seven feet tall. I figured he had to be in sports but he wasn't in sports.&quot; Colbert: &quot;Yes. The tall man was not in sports! Neither bounce-ball nor oblong leather zeppelin toss.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But, folks, the image of Romney as a privileged princeling ends today, because now Mitt is just your average blue-collar fan of dressage. Of course, that word may sound highfalutin, but don't worry, it also goes by the street name 'horse ballet.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And folks, lest you think the horse is doing all the work, Mitt picks the music himself. At this year's world cup, he chose a selection of songs from soundtrack to 'Rainman.' Clearly Mitt envies Rainman's ability to connect with people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And folks, in support of Mitt Romney, I am making dressage the official 'The Colbert Report' sport of the summer. So, kids run out and get yourself a $100,000 Hanoverian and start moving to the sound track from cocktail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So folks, clearly Romney is surging and how's President Obama reacting? Well, conveniently folks, classified info about his anti-terror operations happen to be leaking all over the news. First, there were reports about a so-called kill list of terrorist drone targets. Then confirmation of US involvement in Stuxnet virus that attacked computers at Iran's nuclear site. There's even been rumors of a war going on in Afghanistan. Although I'm not sure I believe that one. I think we'd hear something about it on the news.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You don't have to be a genius to see a pattern here. Just ask these not-geniouses.&quot; Unidentified speaker: &quot;Allegations are wracking Washington tonight -- is the White House leaking information for political reasons to make President Obama look better politically?&quot; Unidentified speaker: &quot;Somebody connected to the highest level of the Obama administration has decided to leak three different scenarios that make the President look like a strong national security leader.&quot; Unidentified speaker: &quot;He's trying to be like George Patton and John Wayne.&quot; Colbert: &quot;So, obviously he's trying to be like George Patton and John Wayne or Errol Flynn of Douglas Fairbanks, that will lock up the youth vote!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But now the cat's out of the bag! The terrorists know we have drone strikes. Before this leak, Al Qaeda thought their leaders were just spontaneously exploding from natural causes! Maybe, I don't know, maybe bad hummus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But, folks, I'm not surprised that Obama is leaking. The man is desperate for any good news because, let's face it, he can't run on the economy. Though he tries. Just listen to this huge gaffe he made on Friday.&quot; Barack Obama, President of the United States: &quot;We've created 4.3 million jobs over the last two, 27 months. Over 800,000 just this year alone. The private sector is doing fine.&quot; Colbert: &quot;Doing fine? Tell that to the 20 staffers I just fired to make Obama look bad!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it did not take long for Mitt to jump all over this blunder.&quot; Mitt Romney, Republican presidential candidate: &quot;He said the private sector is doing fine! Is he really that out of touch? I think he's defining what it means to be detached and out of touch with the American people.&quot; Colbert: &quot;Well said. Obama is totally out of touch. Romney then flew off in his private jet to watch Rafalca compete in the national dressage championship.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Romney was just getting lukewarmed up.&quot; Romney: &quot;He says we need more firemen, more policemen, more teachers. Did he not get the message of Wisconsin? The American people did! It's time for us to cut back on government and help the American people.&quot; Colbert: &quot;Yes, only Romney has the courage to say what we're all thinking: America is being sucked dry by firemen, policemen and teachers!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Must be nice. The worst part, folks, is our kids look up to these parasites. Ask any brainwashed six-year-old what he wants to be when he grows up and it's always members of public service unions -- firemen, policemen, teachers, kids need to start admiring society's real heroes: Job creators. That's why I am calling for free-market affirming children's books celebrating the one percent. What about 'James and the Giant Year End Bonus?' Or 'Green Eggs and Howard Weinberg, Senior Vice President of Global Currency at Goldman Sachs.' Have your kids read them! Or you might need to read them to your kids because if Romney wins, we might be a little low on teachers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here at 'The Daily Show,' we poke a decent amount fun at media figures, politicians -- perhaps at times unfairly so. Every now and again a politician comes along who is just truly terrible. And really deserving of more scorn than even we can dole out in our nightly 21:30 wise ass-a-thon. I give you Florida governor and Mr. Clean impersonator. If Mr. Clean had for some unknown reason restricted his caloric intake for a period of time -- Rick Scott.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You may remember Governor Scott from his law requiring all Florida welfare recipients to be drug-tested while refusing to submit to one himself.&quot; Unidentified speaker: &quot;Governor, you benefit from hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars every year, so would you would be willing to pee into this cup to prove to Florida taxpayers that you're not on drugs? Not using that money for drugs?&quot; Stewart: &quot;The governor's refusal meant that Aasif Mandvi had to make Aasif Mandvi governor smoothies without its secret ingredient.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republican governor Rick Scott says Florida's voter purge, if you will, is aimed at clearing registration rolls of non-citizens. Wow. People who live in fear of deportation, yet insist on voting. There must be tens of those. But hey, whatever it takes to get those people off your voter rolls. I'm sure there's no unintended consequences.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'The Miami Herald' have found Hispanic, Democratic and independent-minded voters are the most likely to be targeted by the state's purge. So, no unintended consequences. Voter-purge disproportionately targets Hispanics. Right about now, black people in Florida have to be feeling pretty good about themselves. Nothing being done to keep them away from the polls.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Florida, the early-voting period has been cut from 14 days down to eight and eliminates the Sunday before Election Day. African Americans are twice as likely as whites to vote early. In fact, the Sunday before Election Day there are drives by the churches to get-out-to-vote because the polls are open the Sunday before the election. Why can't they just go to church on Saturday like the rest of Florida?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A voter purge weighted against Hispanic voters, closing the polls on a day many African-American voters cast their ballots. Nice try, governor! And taller of the two 'Twin Peaks' backwards-talking guys -- that's right, governor, you heard me! You mildly resemble character actor Carol Franken. Boom! It's that easy! Anyway, your little plan didn't work because you forgot to suppress another powerful influx [of] predominantly Democratic voters - the newly-registered.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of sports, in a new interview, President Obama says he hopes, too, that the NBA Finals go to a game seven. Of course, Obama should probably be focused on other matters, like hoping his presidency goes to a term two. I mean, that's what I would be doing. Priorities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's some more political news. One week after Wisconsin's recall election, today, Governor Scott Walker hosted a bratwurst party for Republicans and Democrats. I didn't go 'cause I heard it was a total sausage fest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you guys hear about this? A few days ago, Mitt Romney visited a restaurant in Iowa, and had trouble thinking of the word for donut. It's a true story. Couldn't think of the word. Newt Gingrich merely responded, 'That never would have happened if I was the nominee, you guys. Donut's on the tip of my tongue! Always. I start all my sentences with donut.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, let's see what's going on in politics. Pundits announcing President Obama starting to lose support among his own party. To give you an idea of how bad it's gotten, today Jimmy Carter compared him to Jimmy Carter. Not good. That's not good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new book out also claims President Obama smoked a lot of marijuana while in college. And in a related story to boost the street cred, you know, Mitt Romney admitted he was once hooked on phonics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, Romney ? Romney announced this week he is going on a Midwest five-day bus tour. The hard part? Explaining to Mitt what a bus is. 'It's not one person per vehicle? You mean many people ride? Isn't that Communist?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, we go to the opposite of advance hologram technology, Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley. Yesterday, he was speaking on the Senate floor and his cell phone started ringing. He tried to get to it as quickly as he can, but he had some trouble turning it off.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Y'all know Betty White, right? Betty White visited President Barack Obama at the White House. That's a nice thing, dropped in to say hello. And I talked to her PR guy, and I said she's been there before. And he said, 'No, no, no. The first time Betty was at the White House she stayed in the Lincoln bedroom with Lincoln. That was the first time she was there.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, by the way, if you have one of those things that you record TV shows with ? what do they call them now? The DVR. If you have one of those, set it for Thursday HBO, because there's going to be a special documentary about George Herbert Walker Bush. He's the father of George W. Bush, the idiot. He's the father. And I think this is going to be fascinating because we've lost track a little bit of George H.W. Bush, and his life and times. So, HBO has put together this documentary entitled '41.' here's a small clip of what you're likely to see. Take a look.&quot; Unidentified speaker: &quot;Devoted husband, decorated veteran, Vice President, president, 41. Then a look at America's most hilarious president, 43. 43. Coming soon.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a certain percentage of the staff who believe Mitt Romney has no idea what a donut is. And I would like to support that, but I think the man has to know what a donut is. Anyway, that's the category tonight ? 'Other ways Mitt Romney describes donuts.' We had a discussion about this upstairs. Some people believe he has no idea what a donut is. Other ways Mitt Romney describes a donut:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, folks, we know who's responsible for the decline of these small towns. Unions. Their demands for a livable wage and accessible fire exits have gutted our economy. Thankfully, public service unions have been taking a beating. First they, lost collective bargaining rights in Wisconsin. Then voters in both San Diego and San Jose cut workers' retirement benefits. Indiana made it illegal for unions to mandate dues for workers and voters in Oz gutted benefits for the lollipop guild. Why am I paying for their diabetes medication?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But sadly folks, one public union scored a major victory and that brings us to tonight's word: free lunch. Folks, despite the national trend against public unions, some people just don't get it. Take these greedy school cafeteria workers in Pennsylvania.&quot; Unidentified speaker: &quot;Unionized workers in Sharpsville, Pennsylvania, in the school district there, have won the right to eat leftovers even when the food is expired. The union filed a grievance for the right to eat expired cafeteria food for free.&quot; Colbert: &quot;These unionized, lunch lady thugs, now have the right to free expired cafeteria food. And given the quality of cafeteria food, expired is an improvement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, the right for workers to dine on our children's table scraps is a huge victory for the unions. I just pray, I just pray other unions, especially public sector unions, don't force us into giving them these kinds of outrageous benefits. I mean, what's next? What's going to happen? Firefighters? Are firefighters demanding the right to pick through the charred remains of the house they just put out? They could get a free melted blender. Or maybe union cops having trouble paying their mortgages will be demanding the right to free lodging in vacant jail cells. They'll already know their neighbors. And union nurses could win the most exciting perk of all: they could win expired medicines. Just think how strong the penicillin will be after it molds a second time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The point is, 100 years ago, unions ushered in things like the 40-hour workweek, the weekend, the end of the child labor, and now 100 years on, they are at it again, demanding benefits that none of us could ever have imagined wanting in our wildest dreams because unlike their lunch, unions seem to have an expiration date.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you paid attention to the news, you know there is terror all around us. The enemies of America are always trying to find new ways to take us down. For example, they keep replacing the pants in my dresser with ones that have smaller waists. I'm on to you, Al Qaeda.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, the presidential election is less than five months away. It's a time when the American people reflect on the state of nation and the needs of its citizenry, examine which presidential candidate's policy and temperament would best address these urgent and critical time. That's our job. Their job is to raise as much [bleep] money as they can get their hands on. And it appears that is going to come down to the wire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama, as the incumbent, in terms of fund-raising, appears to have the inside track.&quot; Unidentified speaker: &quot;The President shattering records for fund-raising events. He's held more than 150 so far as president. That's nearly double the number George W. Bush attended during his whole first term.&quot; Stewart: &quot;Yeah! Maybe if Obama was running against this cat, he could phone it in, too. That's John Kerry by the way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's true, just yesterday, President Obama attended six separate fund raisers just in the northeast corridor. Would have been seven, but that would be a bit much, don't you think, seven fund raisers. I mean, come on. He's the President. He does need some down time to plan tomorrow's fund raisers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, it feels beneath office of the presidency for Obama to have to hustle this hard for dough all the time, but you know what? He made $3.5 million from three fund raisers in one day. Beat that, Mitt Romney.&quot; Unidentified speaker: &quot;According to Politico, Romney and the Republican National Committee raised about $77 million in May.&quot; Stewart: &quot;So! All Obama has to do is six fund raisers a day for the next 22 to 23 days and he matches you. As long as there are no other fund-raising factors I think we have found that the finances even out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama is working his&quot; tail &quot;off, six fund raisers a day trying to squeeze a mere $3.5 million. Meanwhile, Romney has Adelson going, 'Hey, Gene, why don't you pop off a check to Romney for $10 million. You can sign it.' 'All right, Mr. Adelson, I'll get right on it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sheldon Adelson gave $10 million to Mitt Romney? Because in the Republican primary, I seemed to remember him backing a different, fatter-headed horse.&quot; Unidentified speaker: &quot;He gave $2001 million to a pro-Gingrich PAC during the primaries.&quot; Stewart: &quot;That guy!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here is some political news you guys -- President Obama is apparently planning to skip a major environmental summit in South America, or as the Secret Service put it, 'Oh man! Are you sure you don't want to go? You should go. You should be there.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The next quote is from Mitt Romney, he said, 'America cannot continue to lead the family of nations around the world if we suffer the collapse of the family here at home.' That sounds like something Mitt would say because it sounded really boring.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the White House softball team played the pro-marijuana lobbyists team and lost 25-3. Still no word yet on which side President Obama played for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Interesting article in 'USA Today' this week about the dilemma black Mormons face in choosing between President Obama and Mitt Romney. In case you're wondering, America's black Mormons are named Clarence and Louise. They live right outside of Provo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, have you seen that video that's gone viral of Mitt Romney having trouble trying to recognize the chocolate doughnut? Did you see this video? Yeah, it's all over the web. At first he said, 'Is that beluga caviar on the bagel? What is that?' See, that's why he needs Chris Christie as his Vice President. Because if anyone can identify a doughnut, it's Chris Christie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you see this? TV icon Betty White visited President Obama in the Oval Office this week. You know, the last time Betty visited the White House, of course, it was still under construction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Commerce Secretary, a guy named John Bryson, you hear about this? He got cited with a felony hit-and-run here in California after he crashed into a car, got out, talked to the other driver, got into his car, crashed into that car again, drove away, and then crashed into another car. Well, he's now taken a leave of absence. But the good news? It's the first new job the White House created all year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This exciting news, president Obama is coming to Chicago this weekend, did you know that? Yeah. True. Yeah, Obama is introducing his new economic plan as part of the 'Just for Laughs' festival.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a fun fact, fun fact. On the first date, President Obama reportedly took his wife Michelle to the Art Institute of Chicago. Yeah. Meanwhile, on their first date, Mitt Romney bought his wife the Art Institute of Chicago.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Somalia, anybody ever been to Somalia? Al Qaeda has a branch in Somalia, and they're active and they are now putting a bounty on the head of important people around the world. I'll give you an example: Joe Biden now has a bounty on his head from this Al Qaeda group in Somalia. Ten chickens. Ten chickens. A couple of guys at KFC said, 'Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute.' And I said, 'What, is this Al Qaeda or a 4H project.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You remember we had George Bush, George W. Bush. Eight years we had George W. Bush and that was fun. We had a lot of fun with George W. and he's our cutest, I think he was our cutest president. And he was, I think, our only president who was once a cheerleader, a former cheerleader.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, when I say JPMorgan do you know anything about it? It's like a big, powerful bank and they have all the money and we have no money and JPMorgan and the guy who is the CEO of JPMorgan he was in front of Congress today. And listen to this. Apply this ? here is what you have to do in this world. You have to apply these situations to your own life. You have to substitute these big shots for yourself. Now listen to this. He is in front of Congress, the CEO of JPMorgan, and he's apologizing. You know what he's apologizing about? And remember, this could be you. He is apologizing because his bank lost investors two billion dollars. He's apologizing. 'Are you really sorry? Ok, don't let happen again.' I drive over my neighbor's garden hose, I'm going to jail. 'I said I was sorry.' 'Too bad, buddy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The latest poll -- Americans have, now listen to this, this is stunning because we're getting ready to elect somebody. Americans have no confidence in Mitt Romney, Mitty, The Mitten. No confidence. No confidence in Mitt Romney, no confidence in Barack Obama when it comes to the economy. No confidence and we're getting ready to elect one of these guys. Honest to God. You know who that leaves? Batman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if you folks know about this. But first of all, I just want to say one more time, electing a president, I mean we're all screwed. Nothing can be done. No problem can be...look at the mess we're in. And it's not like its getting better, oh, things are getting ? oh, ten chickens for the vice president. Things aren't getting any better.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And think about this, if you are going to vote for Mitt Romney, fine. I have no problem with that vote for Mitt Romney. Just for the love of God, make a decision and vote. It is all about judgment. And Mitt Romney is the guy who decided his dog should ride on the roof of car. Just remember that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I mean, if you were having dinner with Mitt Romney or you ran into him on a bus, like he's been on a bus, the first thing anybody would say is, 'Hey, you're the guy that makes his dog ride on the roof of his car.' I mean, after that it's game over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And he says the first thing he will do is stand up to the Chinese, you know. Good luck. The Chinese don't care if your dog is on the roof of your car.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A company in Germany makes a vending machine that dispenses gold bars. They make them. I don't know what you would need them for. Mitt Romney has three in his kitchen. 'Roll out the gold.' That's how he talks. No, that's how he talks because I can't do his voice. It is the same with Obama. I can't talk like Obama, so I do a French accent. 'I'm the President.' 'Not for long.' That's exactly what the debate will sound like in my head.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, we are less than five months away from picking our next president. And at this point, it's anybody's election. Oh, I'm sorry, not anybody's, I'm sorry, Herman -- either Obama or Romney's election. Because the latest Gallup Poll has them separated by less than a percentage point. In 2004, we had an equally close race between Bush and Kerry. That year, Bush won because 11 states had anti-marriage ballot initiatives that drove conservatives to the polls. Cause nothing gets value voters to yank the lever like the thought of two guys yanking each other's levers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well folks, this year there is one hot-button issue that could give Obama the edge.&quot; Unidentified speaker: &quot;The legalization of marijuana, once unheard of in most every political corner, is now pretty much mainstream. And it's an issue that can win elections.&quot; Unidentified speaker: &quot;Fifty percent of Americans now say they favor legalization of marijuana, which is I believe a record high.&quot; Colbert: &quot;Yes, marijuana support is at a record high just like its supporters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, crucial, crucial swing states including Colorado, Ohio and Michigan will all have pot legalization initiatives on the ballot this November. And Democrats are hoping that it will boost turnout among young people. Yes. Because folks, this is the ultimate grass-roots campaign. And folks, folks, these pro-pot initiatives, if they make it on to the ballot, I say Romney is doomed. Because we call know pot smokers are highly motivated, organized, and punctual. There is nothing they would love more than getting off the couch, putting on pants and going to high school gyms packed with judgmental old people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I say folks, Romney's only hope is that on November 6th, Discovery runs a 'Planet Earth' marathon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, Romney's other only hope is that he's attracting a completely different demographic. These dead white men.&quot; Unidentified speaker: &quot;It was revealed yesterday that super PACs on the right will probably provide Mitt Romney with close to a billion dollars, if not more than that.&quot; Colbert: &quot;A billion dollars on the election. Just more evidence that Obama's presidency has led to wasteful spending.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All of this super PAC super cash is thanks to Citizens United, the Supreme Court decision which established that in politics, money equals free speech. As Justice Anthony Kennedy explained in the majority opinion, and I quote, 'ka-ching.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, of course, the hand ringers out there say that injecting that much money into the election is bad. But in a recent column, political pundit and popcorn magnate George Will has a droll riposte writing, 'Last year Procter &amp; Gamble spent three billion more that will be spent by the Obama and Romney campaigns and super PACs supporting them. So more is spent to influence American's choice of their detergent than of their president.' Precisely. Buying detergent and electing a president are exactly the same thing. Because when I buy Tide, I have to use it for four years and so does everyone in America. Also, Tide gets to approve drone strikes on its enemies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, I'm surprised Republicans haven't already nominated Tide for president. It gets your whites whiter than white.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But shockingly, there may be a downside to having our political process engulfed by a tsunami of tsu-money. There is so much super PAC cash to be spent this year that TV networks could actually run out of air time to sell for political ads. There's a finite number of commercials? You wouldn't guess that from watching movies on TNT.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Politicians raise all this money to spend on TV. Now, there's not enough TV to spend it on. All that money's backing up. We're going to get blue bills.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Luckily, luckily, folks, there is an innovation in free speech from former Hawaii governor and rejected Superman love interest Linda Lingle. She is running for the Senate seat vacated by Dan Akaka. Lingle was hoping to follow Akaka in Hawaii's long tradition of senators with hilarious names.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She is currently trailing her likely Democratic opponent by 20 points, but all that is about to change.&quot; Unidentified speaker: &quot;A US Senate candidate in Hawaii is giving the term channel surfing a whole new meaning. Former Hawaii Governor Linda Lingle has launched her own cable channel.&quot; Unidentified speaker: &quot;Beginning on or about June 21st, Lingle 2012 will be added to oceanic cable's digital line-up.&quot; Unidentified speaker: &quot;Which means you'll be able to watch her any time of the day.&quot; Colbert: &quot;That's right. Linda Lingle is using campaign funds to start her own cable channel. So now you will be able to see her any time you turn on the TV. Just like Senator Seacrest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With Lingle 2012, Lingle can reach voters who will watch 24 hours of political ads, key demographics like insomniacs, people in traction, people who can't find the remote, people trapped under a bookcase. Empty Best Buy stores and cats left alone with the TV for comfort.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I say this breakthrough in free speech is too important to keep isolated on Hawaii like Tom Selleck or leprosy. This, this is the most important election of our lifetime. And if money is speech, speech that informs voters, and an informed electorate is the bedrock of democracy, then for the good of this divided nation I say Barack Obama and Mitt Romney should each immediately get their own cable channels dedicated solely to their election. Oh, that was quick.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, as you remember, I want to take you back a little bit. Somewhere around four years ago our economy experienced a cyclical fiscal phenomenon known as a catastro-[bleep]. When our largest financial institutions began to collapse after making incredibly risky bets basically using our pension money to gamble on the value of our houses. Because apparently, the business of just taking your money and then loaning it out to other people at slightly higher interest rates is just too reliable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You guys, here's some political news. Yesterday, President Obama said the GOP's platform could be summed up in a single tweet that would say, 'Things aren't as good as they should be, and it's Obama's fault.' In response, the GOP issued a statement saying, 'Hey, that's pretty good. Can you re-tweet that? That's pretty good. I like that.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of President Obama, today he gave a major speech where he defended his handling of the economy. And there were tons of people in the audience, you know, since nobody had to be at work. So, they were all there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, Republican Senator John McCain and Democrat Harry Reid have called for the Federal government to step in and help regulate the sport of boxing. Is that a good idea? Something so corrupt and unethical. They're attempting to regulate something so corrupt and unethical. I don't think it's going to work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Guantanamo Bay getting millions and millions dollars of upgrades and renovations. In fact, they're not even calling it a detention camp anymore. It's now a gated community. A gated community. There you are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, you heard about this? The US Anti-Doping agency has brought formal charges against Lance Armstrong. Armstrong responded, the charges are false. That he's passed over 500 drug tests in his life. He's passed 500 drug tests. Shouldn't that be enough? Even President Obama can't pass 500 drug tests.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Federal prosecutors also announced they're dropping all charges against John Edwards. So, ladies, he is available.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah. So let me see. Charges against Joe Edwards have been dropped. Charges against Lance Armstrong have been reinstated. So, let's clarify. It's okay to cheat on your wife and use millions of dollars in campaign funds to cover it up, but God help you if you're an American who wins a bicycle race in France. Then you are screwed. Then you are so screwed. Then you are so screwed.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's right. Obama might support legalized marijuana to boost his chances of winning the election in November. Or as stoners put it in December, 'weren't we supposed to -- we were supposed to do something, right?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama spent about four hours on Father's Day playing golf at the Beverly Country Club in Chicago. It was his 100th round of golf. One hundred rounds since taking office. He's played more golf than Tiger Woods in the last four years. Well actually, his staff is a little concerned. They're concerned all this golf is cutting into his fundraising.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The jury has found Roger Clemens not guilty of lying to Congress about steroid use. They said he did not lie in front of Congress. You know what that means? He was the only one in that room who wasn't a liar.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Obama is going to let certain illegal immigrants stay in this country. But there is an age requirement. You have to be old enough to vote by November. Well, this move will allow 800,000 illegal immigrants to be able to find work legally, which is pretty amazing because, I mean, 12 million legal Americans can't find any work. So that's pretty amazing. Not funny, obviously. But amazing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the big rumor is that President Obama might legalize marijuana as a surprise before election day. Isn't election day always a surprise for marijuana smokers? 'It's today?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Is that a big deal, legalizing marijuana? When was the last time a bunch of people about to share a joint, one of them goes, 'Hey, wait a minute. Isn't this illegal?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what President Obama did yesterday on Father's Day? And I don't blame the guy. They say President Obama played golf a hundred times in his first Administration, four-year period. His first term in the White House, he has played golf a hundred times. I don't care, play every day. By God, if I played golf and I were President, neither of which is likely, I'd be playing every damn day. So he played on Father's Day. Donald Trump, always looking to make trouble, always looking to rain on somebody's parade, Donald Trump demanded to see Obama's scorecard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney ran into protesters over the weekend. Did you hear about this? Yesterday in a Mitt Romney speech in Ohio protesters kept shouting, 'Romney, go home.' Luckily for Romney, he owned three homes nearby.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend President Obama issued an order that allows some illegal immigrants to stay in the country. Yeah. Or as Fox News reported it: 'Obama Issues Order Allowing Himself to Stay in The Country.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if you heard this, but in Utah for the first time ever and I believe it's the first time ever, a black female Mormon Republican is running for Congress. Black female Mormon Republican. According to recent polls she has a slight lead over her opponent, a gay Muslim unicorn.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Obama played his 100th round of golf since taking office. You could tell it was Obama 'cause he finished about 14 trillion over par. One hundred rounds of golf since being elected. It was weird. When Obama asked the caddy for a recommendation, he was like, 'Don't play too much golf.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Mitt Romney served pancakes at a special Father's Day's breakfast in Ohio. People knew the pancakes were made by Romney because each one was flipped like 100 times.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new study found out that Republicans are more likely to go to Dunkin' Donuts while Democrats are more likely to get their breakfast at Starbucks, while Governor Chris Christie takes a bipartisan route and gets a breakfast from each place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You guys, I saw that Rhode Island just became the 15th state to decriminalize small amounts of marijuana. It's true. Which explains why today state lawmakers are like, 'Wait, how are we both a road and an island?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Friday, Barack Obama announced in a Rose Garden ceremony that he will not be deporting illegal immigrants brought here as children who have a high school diploma and no criminal record. This, of course, replaces our long-standing policy of not deporting them if they were really good at baseball. This is shocking, shocking. Obama has now thrown open America's doors to people who are already here. Now we can expect a steady stream of preexisting pouring into their present locations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is cynical. Obama needs to do something to attract Hispanic voters in November and right now he's barely clinging to a 43-point lead. Sounds impressive, but remember that's in pesos. ... The President is not supposed to do anything in an election year, let alone the right thing. Now maybe I am a conspiracy theorist, but I'm beginning to think that Barack Obama is trying to get re-elected. You don't see Republicans cynically pandering to Latinos like this. I mean, just look at the GOP's Hispanic outreach webpage. Last week, the front banner featured a stock photo of Asian children. I mean, I think that is wonderful. It's the promise of America. These Asian kids can grow up to be anything they want to be, even Hispanic. Meanwhile, meanwhile folks, you want to talk about pandering, just look at what the Democratic logo is. A burro. And I'm sure if you hit it with a stick, candy and free healthcare falls out. I'll tell you, I don't think Hispanics are going to fall for Obama's little ploy of promising to help and then doing it. They want a man of principle. A man who will promise not to help and then won't.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a great day for our President. He's down in Mexico for the G-20 summit. Today, he met with Russia's adorable Vladimir Putin. He said, 'I think your communist policies are a danger to the world.' There's no word on how Obama responded, but that's what he said.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the big story, as you know -- the jury has found Roger Clemens not guilty of lying to Congress about steroid use. How about that? That was a ten-week trial.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see right after his acquittal, Clemens got a little emotional on the courthouse steps. He actually cried, yeah. He's accused of lying to Congress, and he cried. You know what that means? He could be our next Speaker of the House.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Obama announced that illegal immigrants who came to this country as children will be able to stay and obtain work permits. He said it's not a permanent fix. It's just a temporary stopgap measure to help him get reelected, so it's not a permanent solution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And with the presidential debates right around the corner -- just a couple of months, they'll start -- John Kerry is going to play Mitt Romney to help the President prepare for the debates. That's kind of a stretch. A rich, white guy from Massachusetts playing a rich, white guy from Massachusetts. And how does that make John Kerry feel? 'Hey, John, we need a guy that's kind of stiff, out of touch and a flip flopper. You'll be perfect. Just be yourself. Just be yourself when you get there.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the NAACP announced that Mitt Romney will speak at their convention next month. I think Mitt's a little confused. He thinks NAACP stands for National Association for the Advancement of Corporate Profits. It's a different organization. So I don't know if he's prepared.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is talk that the Supreme Court may issue their upcoming decision on healthcare reform on live television. Did you hear this? They decided it may be on live television. To boost ratings, each judge will give their decision after spinning around in their chair to face the camera. I think the Supreme Court should do that all the time on every decision. That would get all of us interested again, don't you think?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama has issued an order allowing some illegal immigrants to stay in the United States. Mitt Romney says he is fine with this plan, at least until his landscaping is finished.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama has asked Senator John Kerry to stand in as Mitt Romney while he practices for the upcoming debate. Big job, big job for Kerry.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, Obama's using John Kerry as a stand-in for Romney. When he heard someone was pretending to be Mitt Romney, Romney was like, 'Wait, that's my job.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, former pitcher Roger Clemens was found not guilty of lying to Congress in 2008 about steroid use. You could tell he was happy. After the verdict, he had his trainer inject him with champagne.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I read that Vice President Biden's wife was spotted shopping for lingerie yesterday with Secret Service agents surrounding her. They weren't protecting her or anything. They just happened to be getting some things for their prostitutes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The first rule of election year seduction is knowing your audience. Both candidates gave speeches on Thursday that offered demographic snapshots of their respective campaigns. Barack Obama must appeal to a diverse, endlessly fractured coalition of competing interests while Romney has to bring together what appears to be 50 shades of white.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, the 2012 presidential election is right around the corner, and it will all come down to a clash of ideas: Do we want bigger government, gay marriage, and class warfare? Or do we prefer Mitt Romney's message: 'I look like a President.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama has chosen Kerry to play Mitt Romney? That is shocking-- somebody chose John Kerry for something. But, folks, I don't know if Kerry is up to playing Romney. In 2004, Kerry was a compromise candidate. In 2012, Romney's a consensus candidate. Kerry couldn't connect with voters. Romney can't relate to the electorate. Kerry was in a toss-up race against an unpopular incumbent. But Romney is in a tight contest against an unpopular sitting President! It's like they're from completely different pages of a thesaurus! ... What's more, John Kerry is a war hero. Meanwhile, Obama avoided the Vietnam draft with a letter from his family doctor diagnosing him as medically eight.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, there is a record heat wave back East. Oh, my God. Close to 100 degrees in New York City. It was so hot, Mayor Bloomberg said, 'Screw it, give me an extra large soda. I don't care. Give me the big 44 oz.' It was so hot in New Jersey, the tanning mom actually caught fire, melting into a puddle of tang. It was so hot, John Edwards and Rielle Hunter hooked up on somebody's front lawn, just hoping they'd turn the hose on them. That's how hot it was. The temperatures are higher than President Obama was in high school. That's how hot.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Chicago, some anti-Mitt Romney protesters told reporters they're being paid to protest.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And an Ohio man was arrested Sunday for making crystal meth while inside a Wal-Mart store. The guy grabbed all the ingredients he needed in the Wal-Mart. I didn't know they sold the kit at Wal-Mart to make crystal meth. Anyway, he mixed them all together, but in his defense -- hey, you try finding a last minute Father's Day gift. It is not easy. Turns out that crystal meth was the only thing in the whole Wal-Mart that was actually made in America. So that's a good thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the polls, they say Barack Obama has a 15-point lead over Mitt Romney and as a matter of fact they're saying you have to be careful. In politics, you can't get too cocky and they say it may be happening to Barack Obama.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt, now everybody goes through this, making his first presidential decision. He's picking a running mate.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to political insiders and pundits, they say -- I don't know if this is true -- that Sarah Palin has poisoned the well for national female candidates.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Breaking news concerning the ongoing investigation into the Administration's 'Fast and Furious' program, which from 2009 to 2011 sold American guns to Mexican drug lords. So that the drug lords could shoot people? Or perhaps accidentally themselves? The White House was on a high after 'Cash for Clunkers' and this program might have just gotten away from them, I don't know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The House Oversight Committee has been investigating the debacle, but Attorney General Eric Holder has refused to turn over some 80,000 documents that Chairman Darrell Issa has demanded, citing as grounds that they need the papers to gift wrap other weapons for an exciting new prison program: 'Christmas Guns for Convicts.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sure there's a lot of [bleep] partisan type investigations that go on Capitol Hill, many of them designed to merely tie up or damage the Administration, but here's the thing: The ATF did send a bunch of guns to Mexican drug gangs. One of those guns was used to kill a US Border agent. So, you know if Holder didn't turn over the documents this was coming. ... Oh, the first invoking of the executive privilege. A hallowed rite of passage. Like a Presidency's bar mitzvah. Mazel Tov, Mr. President. Today you are an Administration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But, of course, our main story tonight, President Obama, who was attending the G-20 summit in Mexico where he's been meeting with world leaders and perhaps checking whether drug lord gun sales are hitting their quotas. All right. Russian president Vladimir Putin is there as well. Perhaps we can lean on Putin to stop selling his weapons to Syrian war lords because selling weapons to violent foreign... Oh, [bleep].&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, I don't have to tell you that illegal immigration is a problem in this country. Because I can pay a Mexican to tell you for me. But this week a Pew Research study revealed the most shocking new threat to our porous borders since the Hispani-pult: Asian Americans now the fastest-growing race in the United States. Asians overtook Hispanics between 2000 and 2010 when it comes to the percentage of people immigrating to the country. Yes! Asians are the new Mexicans! Our nacho nemesis has morphed into a ramen rival.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, folks, not that Mexico isn't still a problem in its own right. Case in point: The Obama Administration's ongoing cover-up of operation 'Fast and Furious.' I'm so mad about this, folks, just thinking about 'Fast and Furious' makes me -- I don't know, quickly angry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes, 'Fast and Furious' was an unconscionable waste of money to promote senseless acts of violence-- just like the movies it was named for. Since 2011, folks, California Representative and Slytherin House Master Darrell Issa has demanded key documents that Attorney General Eric Holder has brazenly withheld on the flimsy excuse that they would endanger undercover agents.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Boy, another day of record-setting temperatures all across the country. It was 100 degrees in New York City. ... It was so hot, you know Solyndra, the solar company? Actually made money. That's how hot it was! It was so hot, Attorney General Eric Holder was selling water guns to Mexican drug gangs. That how hot it was! Mitt Romney rode on the roof of his own car just to feel the cool breeze. That's how hot it was!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to Federal reports filed yesterday, the Obama campaign spent more money than they raised in the month of May. They spent more money than they raised? Well, it's called being a Democrat. Duh. Hello!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Mitt Romney's campaign is now thoroughly vetting potential running mates for Romney. This is a long and complicated process. This vetting, you know, trying to find the Vice President. It's a lot different than the way John McCain -- remember how he picked Sarah Palin? He pointed and said, 'Uh, the one in the booth. Yeah take that one.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the House committee is now recommending that Attorney General Eric Holder be cited for contempt of Congress. Now, don't confuse that for what you and I have. That's contempt for Congress. That is a totally different issue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a Detroit man, through a series of mistakes by Bank of America, was allowed to withdraw $1.5 million over an 18 month period from his ATM.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney tried to win over a skeptical Hispanic audience in Florida. He came out and tossed the crowd his car keys. 'Why don't you take that out back? Take it around. I'll just pick that up later.' He didn't know what he had done wrong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, the Supreme Court -- this is huge -- has decided not to fine broadcast networks for fleeting expletives or momentary nudity. Yeah, yeah, not going to do it.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some more election news. A new report found that President Obama's campaign spent $6 million more than it raised last month.

I got some Hootie &amp; the Blowfish, some Spin Doctors.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new survey found that only 31% of Americans would want to sit next to Mitt Romney on a flight. Romney was so upset, he is like, 'I don't understand, how would they get on my private jet? I don't understand. Doesn't make sense to me. I'm going to call security.' Yeah, just 31% of Americans would sit next to Romney on an airplane and 57% would rather sit next to President Obama, while 100% would want to watch them have to sit next to each other, just have them go at it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We begin tonight with the controversy regarding Attorney General Eric Holder. ... It all began with an ATF program called Fast and Furious, in which the US government allowed guns to be smuggled to Mexican drug runners in order to find out where Mexican drug runners were getting their guns. It turned out to be from our government. They actually-- circle of life. Any-whooo, we lost track of about-- hold on, hold on-- 2,000 guns. Although, on the bright side, we did end up finding one of them when it was used to kill a US Border Patrol agent. Congress ultimately asked the Justice Department the details of this Fast and Actually Somewhat Curious program, to which the DOJ responded in February 2011, 'Program? I don't know about the program. I never heard-- let me look for the letter 'F.' Nope, no Fast and Furious. We don't know what you're talking about.' About a month later, CBS breaks the story of the program publicly, at which point the Justice Department waits another nine months and withdraws the first letter and sends Congress a new letter saying, 'Oh, Fast and Furious. Yeah. We have that. We've just-- we didn't realize that's what you were talking about. We've been calling it Donde Suspicious Esta Los Weapons Automatico.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A spokesman for Romney said, 'I dare him to come to India and say that to my face. I dare him.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Supreme Court has made a lot of decisions today. The Supreme Court has affirmed that corporations can spend as much money on political campaigns as they want. That's the ruling, yeah. You don't like it, but this decision was praised by Senator Chevron P. Mountaindew.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's get to some election news, you guys. Over the weekend, Mitt Romney held a retreat for his donors which included dancing. At one point, people started doing The Robot, or as Romney called that 'The Me.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's get right to a breaking Colbert News alert. It's a developing story on the legal battle over Obamacare. The Supreme Court has decided last Thursday to decide today that they will decide next Thursday. At which time, Justice Roberts will hop into the General Lee, jump the press corps and haul ass out of town screaming 'Noooo healthcare!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've got some good news and some bad news. The good news is there's plenty of bad news which is great news for Mitt Romney. You see, the cornerstone of Mitt's campaign is that he can fix Obama's broken economy. So, the worse things are for John Q Public, the better they are for Willard M. Private.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Romney and Obama campaigns are busy raising money. The President has an interesting fundraising idea -- it's called the Obama Event Registry. If you're a supporter of Obama, you tell your loved ones instead of giving you a gift for your wedding or birthday or whatever, you'd like them to donate money to the Obama campaign, which is a great way for cheap people to lie about getting you a present. On the website, it says, quote, 'A campaign donation goes a lot farther than a gravy bowl.' Not if you like gravy, it doesn't.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, as you know, the Supreme Court has already struck down most of Arizona's controversial immigration law. The court voted five to three to strike down the law. The interesting thing is most of the people in Arizona don't know about it yet, because they're still translating the ruling into Spanish.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And there was one awkward moment today at the Supreme Court when Justice Scalia asked to see Justice Sonya Sotomayor's papers. That was kind of awkward.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, in Boston, President Obama was booed when he made a joke about the Red Sox. He was booed. People of Boston haven't booed like that since Romney was governor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former President Jimmy Carter has criticized the United States for using drones to kill terrorists. A lot of people agree with Carter. I mean, they're all terrorists, but I mean, they agree with Carter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney says President Obama's out of touch. And then, after he said that, you know what he did? You know what he did then? I'll tell you, he went back to eating his money sandwich.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama. I mean, what more do you want from this guy? He's working hard and getting stuff done. He's got a checklist and he's checking it off and going after guys and killing people and getting it taken care of. And he says that he doesn't have -- and who can blame him? He doesn't have time to go after illegal immigration. He doesn't have time. He's busy hunting vampires.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone's speculating now about Mitt Romney's running mate, who he's going to pick? The latest rumor is that his running mate will be a white male from Ohio. Or as Romney refers to him, 'a person of color.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new study found that a record number of America's wealthiest citizens are renouncing their citizenship to avoid high taxes. Yeah. Which explains why today Donald Trump claimed he was born in Kenya.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday in New Hampshire, President Obama said Americans need someone who will wake up every single day and fight for their jobs. Then he said, 'But until we find that guy, I'm still your best choice.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Right off the bat, I want to thank some of you for joining us. But only some. Because some of you are not welcome at all. Of course, I'm talking about los illegals which, of course, is Spanish for Mexican. We are powerless against them, folks, thanks to the Supreme Court yesterday overturning Arizona SB-1080, Arizona's attempt to implement their own immigration policy in opposition to the current Federal immigration policy of not having an immigration policy. It was a 5-3 decision with Elena Kagan recusing herself and Sonia Sotomayor allowed to vote only after she showed her papers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We must return to our founders' dream of every state deciding who it could turn away at its border. Now, I believe that when I head home to Connecticut after work I should have to show my papers-- especially after they drag off my driver Luis for forgetting his. It's easy. Fifty states; 50 immigration policies. ... Scalia's right. If Arizona is a sovereign state, it should have its own immigration standards, its own standing army, its own currency, its own Olympic team, its own space program, and its own debts with China.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;The final state primary election of the season happened quietly in Utah today. It was meaningless because Mitt Romney and Barack Obama clinched the nomination. The primaries are over. But the real contest begins, November 6th, which ever candidate has raised the most money will be declared President of the United States. That's what the Supreme Court decided, right?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Mitt Romney picked up another backhanded compliment today from retired Senator Bob Dole. In an interview with 'GQ' magazine, Dole was asked if he thought his endorsement for Romney was quote, 'tepid.' Dole endorsed Romney back in December with the same bubbling enthusiasm that most people show in accepting a LinkedIn request. Dole said that he didn't think his endorsement was tepid at all. Then he added, 'I'll say this, Romney looks like a President.' Let's be honest, he looks like he should be in an outdoor bathtub on the set of a Cialis commercial.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Mitt Romney can't seem to get enthusiasm going from his fellow Republicans. George W. Bush endorsed him as the doors to an elevator closed; George Bush, Sr. said he likes Romney now that [Rick] Perry is out of the race. Rick Santorum endorsed him 17 paragraphs into a late-night email. Even his own wife gave him only three stars on Yelp.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This [marijuana decriminalization] bill is dead in New York, but in New Jersey, the State Assembly voted Monday to decriminalize 15 grams of pot, but their governor doesn't want to do it.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, the presidential election is only four months away. It is time for the candidates to put their money with their mouth is, and every other orifices because we're talking about a lot of money. Especially on the Republican side. Just this past weekend, all the big GOP donors were at Deer Valley Resort in Utah at the first national Romney victory leadership retreat. You've got to respect that sort of confidence. The man has not even officially been nominated yet, and he's celebrating victory. I can't wait for this weekend's Mitt Romney Second Inauguration Ho-Down and Presidential Library Fundraiser. The victory retreat was a reward for big donors who had contributed $50,000 or raised $250,000 for the campaign. No word yet on where Mitt will host his small donors, but given the number of them, I'm guessing the back of a tandem bike.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Democrats, of course, have only themselves to blame for their shortfall, because they refused all corporate money for the convention, and they have tried to raise taxes on the top 1%. So, I guess you don't need our money, Democrats. Why don't you run along and ask your little people that you love so much. I'm sure if they reach deep down into their couch cushions, they'll find your $27 million. And if not, maybe a tip jar on the pretty desk that says, 'Change We Can Believe In.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now folks, while Barack Obama here is getting crushed in money ball, he has gotten some good news in the presidential horse race. Or as Romney calls it, the presidential horse valet. Obama is way out front in a recent survey conducted by leading pollster and tribal boob archivist 'National Geographic.' The 'National Geographic' poll asks which candidate would be better able to handle an alien invasion? The answer-- 65% said President Obama. Of course, of course people said Obama. Of course they said Obama. I'm pretty sure he's a Vulcan. ... And they already know where he stands with aliens. He will give them a path to citizenship, so they can come here and steal all the good jobs. Folks, I like this kind of polling. We need to ask more questions to find out what the candidates would never have to do in the situation that will never occur. Just in case it does, which it never will. Remember in 2008, all those Hillary ads asked how candidate Obama would handle that 3:00 a.m. phone call. What I want to know is how would he handle a 3:00 a.m. zombie apocalypse.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a landmark decision, the Supreme Court ruled Obama's healthcare mandate is constitutional after all. You know what that means? You get a chest x-ray! You get a chest x-ray! You get a prostate exam! Well, you know, this, of course, this is a major victory for President Obama, who spent three years promoting it, and, of course, a major setback for Mitt Romney, who spent three years creating it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me tell you something. If you're an illegal immigrant in Arizona who hopes to become a citizen so you can get free healthcare, this is the greatest week of your life.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it's not out of the woods yet. Surveys show that a lot of Americans are still reluctant to entrust their healthcare to an Administration that can't even manage a simple gun-running operation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know, because of that Fast and Furious fiasco, earlier today, the House voted to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress. In protest, the Democrats walked out of the House today. Walked out of the House. If we could just get the Republicans to walk out, too, think how great that would be.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And while talking about the economy this week, Vice President Joe Biden said it's a depression for millions and millions of Americans. He actually used the word 'depression' to describe the economy. See, I don't think he knows the difference. See, the economy is now in a recession. A depression is what happens to President Obama every time Joe Biden speaks in public. He goes into a depression.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to a poll by 'National Geographic,' this is a real poll, 65% of Americans said President Obama would better handle an invasion by space aliens than Mitt Romney. Well, sure. Once the aliens landed, they'd see there were no jobs and they would go back home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the TSA fired eight officers at Newark Airport today for sleeping on the job and violating other rules. Other rules? What other rules? You're already sleeping on the job. What other rule did you violate? Were you drooling on the pillow?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, it's Fourth of July. You excited? And you know what, call me old-fashioned, but what I love best about the Fourth of July is all of the flags. You know, it's great to see the American flag. I mean everywhere you go. Yards and businesses. Any place around. Isn't it nice to see, of course they're all made in China, but still it's the sentiment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney, and this is an important time for a guy running for President. Mitt Romney now has to select a running mate, the Vice President. And as we know that can make-or-break a ticket. It's very important geographically and politically and ideologically, it's very important to get the right running mate. ... So he has to find somebody. Romney has to find somebody who he is politically compatible with, and I thought, 'Well, doesn't he take every side on every issue, how can that be a problem?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was reported that House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi wore her lucky purple shoes to the Supreme Court's healthcare ruling while House Speaker John Boehner wore his lucky orange face.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;CNN was mistakenly reporting that the Supreme Court struck down the President Obama's healthcare law. In response, CNN was like, 'Whew, thank God no one watches us.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But of course, the main story tonight, the Supreme Court's ruling on the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare. Yes, this morning all Americans, indeed, all citizens of the world gathered together to see what our nation's highest court would say. Will conservatives rule the day and overturn the individual mandate? Or will liberals reign, granting the government power to keep old people alive artificially so that we may harvest their organs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, by a 5-4 decision what actually happened was Chief Justice John Roberts joined the liberal justices and wrote the majority opinion that the individual mandate [was] deemed unconstitutional under the commerce clause, but that didn't matter because the decision held the individual mandate as within Congress' power to levy taxes. It was very confusing, unless you read obviously up to page four. How excited was the President? Well, he strolled down his 'I killed bin Laden Lane and addressed the nation.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[On Romney reaction to the decision] &quot;So, you going to keep everything but the mandate, aka the thing that pays for all of it. So, the fiscally responsible Republican is saying 'Don't worry, you are going to get all the goodies but not the bill. Because that would be taxes. And that would be tyranny, except in Massachusetts where it works and oh [bleep] just make me President, okay! I have been running for like 2,000 years, you know, this isn't going to last forever, people. I got like six to eight more years of handsome!'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;J Rob! How you could? I trusted you. Where is the man who said unlimited corporate money was speech? Where is the man who voted against equal pay for women? I don't even know who you are anymore! Nation, this is the worst betrayal since Benedict Arnold teamed up with Judas to stab Caesar right in the croutons. Folks, I am not the only one who has had their man-crush crushed. Republican Congressman and Georgia peach Phil Gingrey said of Roberts, 'I don't want to drink a beer with him today. I'm not calling for his impeachment; I'm just very, very disappointed.' Are you happy, Justice Roberts? Now Phil Gingrey is going to have to spend another night drinking alone. And friend of the show, Georgia's Jack Kingston, was even more crestfallen, tweeting 'With Obamacare ruling I feel like I just lost two great friends. America and Justice Roberts.' Well, if it's any help, Congressman, Phil Gingrey is looking for someone to drink with. And you know what, [bleep] it, I might join them. Look, why not, why not. My liver's covered now. I mean, if I don't get cirrhosis I'm losing money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were fools. Roberts has always been in Obama's pocket. Think about it. He's the one who single-handedly made Obama President. And come to think of it, come to think of it, folks, what kind of name is John Roberts? Where did he grow up? Indiana. Oh, isn't that nice, that sounds suspiciously close to Indonesia where Obama ate that dog. Plus, what kind of American sits around in robes all day and calls himself a chief? I heard on Drudge that his middle name is [tongue clicks].&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;This morning the Supreme Court ruled in favor of President Obama's healthcare plan. You know what that means -- free pap smears for everyone. I honestly have no idea what a pap smear is. I've been trying to keep it that way until I die. The Affordable Care Act is what it's called. It will change how the healthcare industry works. Children will stay on their parent's insurance until age 26. Medicaid will be extended to 16 million low income Americans. Insurance companies can't turn you away for having a preexisting condition like diabetes or being the contestant on the show 'Wipeout.' The Supreme Court voted in favor of the new law 5-4. Chief Justice John Roberts went against his party to uphold what they call the individual mandate. An individual mandate is something that the Bachelorette was on. I have no idea what happened, truth be told. Bottom line seems to be we'll all have healthcare no matter what. I'll make the most [of it] this year and get very, very fat this year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a great day for President Obama. His healthcare law was upheld by the Supreme Court. The President apparently had three speeches ready to go this morning. One if the law was overturned. One if the law was upheld. And one if Joe Biden chewed up the other two.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the President is very cocky now, the President. He released a statement today. 'You know who this healthcare doesn't help? Osama bin Laden.' And then he added, 'Yeah, I was born in Kenya, so what?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, in a surprise decision yesterday, conservative Chief Justice John Roberts voted with the liberal justices to uphold President Obama's healthcare law.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what this means? People will now have to have health insurance. You know, the same way every driver in California has car insurance. The same way. Exactly. This is something people will follow to the letter of the law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
