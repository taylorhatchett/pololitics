"According to a new poll, Donald Trump was the candidate Americans would least want to have as their neighbor. It makes sense because he'd build a massive wall between your yards and make you pay for it."
"On 'Face the Nation' yesterday, Donald Trump accused Ted Cruz of copying his immigration reform plan - specifically his idea of building a giant wall. Then China said, 'Ah, hello, I think we kind of invented that whole wall thing.'"
"In a recent interview on NPR's 'Morning Edition,' President Obama said the question he would want to ask candidates is why they want to be president. A few of the candidates actually responded. Check out whey they had to say here. Bernie Sanders says, 'I want to bring back more economic equality.' Ted Cruz said, 'I want to stop government overreach.' And Hillary Clinton said, 'I have a list of names.'"
"Donald Trump has released his first TV ad of the 2016 campaign, titled 'Great Again.' And Hillary Clinton has released her new ad TV, titled, 'Great, Again?'"
"Donald Trump said yesterday that if he is elected, he would probably not talk as much. That's right, if Donald Trump is elected, even he will be speechless."
"Republican hopeful Carly Fiorina said on Sunday that Ted Cruz will say whatever he needs to say to win the election, and it's true. Just this morning, Ted Cruz said, 'Hi, I'm Hillary Clinton.'"
"After the calm of the holiday break, Republican candidates are aggressively ramping up their efforts to knock Trump off the top spot. The competition in Iowa is so fierce, in fact, that Texas Sen. Ted Cruz has leased a 48-bed dormitory from a Des Moines business college to house hundreds of volunteers. And I think it's safe to say, with RA Ted Cruz, that won't be the party dorm."
"At a recent campaign stop, Hillary Clinton vowed, if elected, she will investigate UFOs and alien abductions. In response, Donald Trump vowed to deport the aliens back to space Mexico."
"In a recent interview, Hillary Clinton said that she would investigate UFOs if she becomes president. And said that even aliens have already visited the earth. Not to be outdone, Bill actually volunteered to be probed."
"Hillary Clinton said she would investigate UFOs and said that aliens may have already visited earth. When he heard that, Trump said, 'Forget the wall, we need a dome. Let's build a huge, beautiful dome, and make them pay for it. We'll make the aliens pay for the dome.'"
"In an NPR interview last week, Jeb Bush revealed the ingredients for his guacamole recipe, but wouldn't give away the specifics on how to prepare it. So, now I guess we have to elect Jeb Bush."
"President Obama this afternoon said that guns should come with new safety devices, because if a kid can't open aspirin, they shouldn't be able to pull a trigger. And the gun lobby plans to cooperate by making aspirin bottles easier to open."
"Fact-checkers are taking issue with Donald Trump's first campaign ad, released yesterday, which uses footage of people storming a border in Morocco, not Mexico, when discussing illegal immigration. Trump apologized and re-released the ad with new footage. [Meyers showed the new footage of shoppers trampling each other at a store entrance]"
"After being confronted yesterday by a homosexual protester on whether being gay is a choice, Dr. Ben Carson said that's a long conversation. Of course, for him, 'Hello, I'm Ben Carson' is a long conversation."
"[Referring to North Korea's hydrogen bomb announcement] The White House today said the evidence?does not support their claim. But the North Korean government released a statement that said, 'Nothing is more foolish than dropping a hunting gun before herds of ferocious wolves.' Does that make any sense? What are wolves going to do with a gun?"
"Meanwhile, after they made the announcement, the people of North Korea were like, 'This is great. Now can we have food and shoes?'"
I'm a little worried about Senator Sanders. He is currently trailing Hillary Clinton by 17 points. Americans have stopped feeling the Bern and are now feeling more of a mild chafing sensation.
"[Referring to President Obama's executive orders on guns] So, the President has gone through anger and way past bargaining, because yesterday he decided to go it alone, around the Congress, and issue a my-way-or-the-highway, balls-to-the-wall executive order 'clarifying existing laws' and 'noting that criminal penalties already exist for violating those laws.' Ka-boom! A fiery hailstorm of gentle reminders. It turns out, in this case, the President is less of a tyrannical overlord and more of an assistant lifeguard-in-chief."
"At a rally in New Hampshire, Bernie Sanders mocked Donald Trump for thinking that climate change is a hoax created by the Chinese. So, at this point, most people are starting to feel like Trump is a hoax created by the Chinese."
"North Korea announced yesterday that it had successfully carried out its first hydrogen bomb test. Either that, or they just got their first Chipotle."
"North Korea announced last night that they successfully tested a miniaturized hydrogen bomb. The announcement was made by a miniaturized dictator. To him, it looked like a great big regular-sized bomb."
"Donald Trump said today that Hillary Clinton doesn't have the stamina to take on the country's enemies, which is a ridiculous thing to say about someone who has been running for president for 68 years."
"Following the success of the Netflix show 'Making a Murderer,' a new petition seeking a presidential pardon for Wisconsin inmate Steve Avery has now reached 200,000 signatures. Said President Obama, 'Thanks a lot, I was still on episode three.'"
"The former campaign manager for Dr. Ben Carson said today that it is becoming harder to see how Donald Trump will not win the Republican nomination. While Ben Carson said it's becoming harder to see, period."
"Our current president, the one named Obama, is gearing up for what will be his final State of the Union address on Tuesday night. His aides have been describing the speech that he plans to give as non-traditional. Which probably means he's going to do that 'Watch Me Whip, Watch Me Nae Nae' dance, right?"
"The big story is Donald Trump questioning whether his opponent Ted Cruz is actually a US citizen. Because, in 1970, Cruz was born to a Canadian-Cuban father and an American mother, and I'm going to guess a crock of Dippity-do."
"But Cruz has dismissed these questions, saying that any child born abroad to an American citizen is an American citizen. In fact, Cruz has even mocked the ridiculousness, the extremity of Trump's allegations, by posting this video on Twitter of Fonzie from 'Happy Days' jumping the shark. Which I say proves Cruz is an American, because if he were a Canadian, he would have released a video of Celine Dion jumping a Tim Hortons."
"Donald Trump said that he thinks the media is starting to like him. And the media was like, 'Like you? Have you seen our ratings? We love you.' ... Then cable news said, 'Yeah, but we also like natural disasters.'"
"Meanwhile, Donald Trump's wife, Melania, gave an interview, and she said she remembers her first date with Donald like it was two months ago. Then it got awkward when she was like, 'But the marks on my wall clearly show it's been 17 years, two months and six days.'"
"Of course, we're just now a few days away from President Obama's final State of the Union address. ... Which means Joe Biden only has a few days left to decide what weird things he's going to do in the background."
"Vice President Joe Biden, in a new interview, said that he wakes up every day regretting that he didn't enter the 2016 race. And every day, Hillary Clinton holds the rag over his nose, and he goes back to sleep."
"Jeb Bush, in a new interview this week, spontaneously announced that he loves his mother more than his father. And then he ended the interview by running up to his room and slamming the door."
"At a rally last night in Vermont, Donald Trump refused to let anyone in that wasn't a Trump supporter. But several protesters got in anyway. So keep that in mind next time you listen to the guy whose biggest campaign promise is keeping people from sneaking in."
"And this week in Las Vegas, Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, and Martin O'Malley shared the stage at a DNC fund-raiser. Yeah, I think the three of them might have had a little too much fun in Vegas. 'Hangover 4?'"
"I heard an autograph expert has said that Hillary Clinton's autograph is the most valuable of all the candidates. For instance, a Hillary Clinton-signed hat is worth about 1,500 dollars, while a Jeb Bush-signed hat is worth whatever the hat cost originally minus a few bucks for the Jeb Bush signature."
"You guys, we have Donald Trump on the show tonight. I'm not saying security is tight, but the Secret Service just built a giant wall around the building. And we had to pay for it."
"It seems like every day, we are learning something new about Trump. In fact, I just read right after giving a speech, no matter where he is, Trump likes to fly back that night to sleep here in New York. Although sometimes when he's really tired, he'll just buy a hotel."
"Over the weekend, Bernie Sanders said that if he's elected, he plans to spend $1 trillion to fight unemployment. When asked what they would do with that kind of money, unemployed people said, 'Retire.'"
"Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg reportedly commissioned a poll to see how he'd do if he ran for president as an independent candidate. He'd be a billionaire New Yorker running an unexpected campaign for president. Or as one guy called it, 'Total pipe dream.'"
"I read the Republican candidates aired a dozen new TV ads last week, even though recent data has shown TV ads are mostly ineffective. Chris Christie was like, 'If TV ads aren't effective, then why do I keep going to Wendy's for their Gouda bacon-cheeseburger, here only for a limited time?'"
"Donald Trump, in a new interview, continued to question Ted Cruz's eligibility for president and said if you're born in Canada, it's immediately a little bit of a problem. Apparently Trump believes that if you weren't born in the US, the highest office you can hope for is wife."
"The White House revealed over the weekend that President Obama privately met with Bernie Sanders, and when she heard this, Hillary Clinton fake-smiled so hard, her ears touched in the back."
"Justin Bieber and his entourage were in Mexico [and were] reportedly asked to leave the Mayan ruins after Justin climbed to the top of an ancient pyramid and pulled his pants down to moon everyone. If ever there was a time for the gods to send a well-placed lightning bolt, seems like that would have been it. It really is a shame Donald Trump didn't build that wall before Justin got back into the United States."
"Things are looking up for Jeb Bush. No wait, they aren't. Things are looking down for Jeb Bush. A new Gallup poll [shows] Jeb Bush is the least-liked candidate among the Republican field. At least he's leading the field. Right? His name identification among voters is at 89 percent, which is very high. Which means people know who he [is], they just don't like him. And his favorability rating is negative one. I don't know how that's even possible. Zero means nobody likes you - negative one, does that mean dead people have a negative opinion of you?"
"Tonight, President Obama gave his final State of the Union address. And a lot of people said it had a more optimistic tone. Instead of seeing the glass half empty, Obama sees the presidency as seven-eighths over."
"Tonight was Paul Ryan's first State of the Union as Speaker of the House. But get this, did you hear this, Ben Carson recently said that several Republican congressmen actually tried to recruit him for the job. Ben Carson. Of course, they'd have to call him Whisperer of the House."
"Some more news out of Washington. I saw that the White House joined Snapchat yesterday. It's a great platform for the White House, because moments after you make a promise, it magically disappears."
"I saw that Ben & Jerry's ice cream wants to make a flavor inspired by Bernie Sanders. Whatever flavor it winds up being, we know Bernie will hate it for being too rich."
"Seems like a lot of people are getting behind Sanders. In fact, Tommy Chong of 'Cheech and Chong' announced that he is supporting Bernie Sanders for president. People were like, 'Why?' And Tommy Chong is like, 'Why what, man?'"
"Marco Rubio's campaign said that it expects to lose the first four states in the primary elections, but he thinks that he can win the nomination anyway. Which is sort of like not getting a rose on 'The Bachelor' and being like, 'Call me?'"
"There have been about 1,000 fundraising committees known as super PACs created in this election cycle, and over half of them were made by one man who apparently just does it for fun. People are like, 'Who would mess with an election just for fun?' And [Donald] Trump was like, 'You rang?'"
"President Obama tonight delivered his final State of the Union address. Now we taped this show early, but I'm guessing he was interrupted dozens of times by applause, and twice when Hillary Clinton tried to tag in."
"In the lead-up to tonight's State of the Union address, House Speaker Paul Ryan accused Obama of plotting to set verbal traps for Republicans. Responded Obama, 'Loser says what?'"
"A noted Republican strategist published a new article for CNN, claiming that the candidates having the most fun on the campaign trail usually fare the best in elections. While the candidates having the least fun try to hide it but putting an exclamation point at the end of their logo."
"Vice President Joe Biden said this morning that Donald Trump is running a divisive campaign. But most Trump supporters are okay with division, provided it's not long division."
"Well, President Obama gave his final State of the Union address last night. It was the President's shortest State of the Union address, clocking in at 58:49. ... My last one would have been much shorter than that. Mine would have been however long it takes to say, 'You're on your own, suckers,' and that would be it."
"You know, these speeches aren't easy to make for a president. Half the audience is against you. The Democrats clap and the Republicans don't. Over and over again. If you're a Republican, you don't want to get caught agreeing with anything Obama says, because it could ruin your political career. So instead, you have to sit there and make a face like you're witnessing your family getting eaten by coyotes through the whole thing."
"If you check your calendars, the presidential election is now nine months away, which explains why we're all experiencing morning sickness, I think."
"Tonightly, President Obama says in his final State of the Union that anyone claiming America's economy is in decline is 'peddling fiction.' America's like, 'Who cares? We can't read!'"
"The big story is that President Obama gave his final State of the Union address last night. ... He started by saying he would give a shorter speech, and maybe it's just me, but that seemed to get the most applause of the night."
"Obama said he would give a shorter speech, and then wound up speaking for 59 minutes. Not surprising, Obama saying he's going to keep it short is like Donald Trump saying, 'Enough about me.'"
"During his speech, President Obama criticized companies for not being loyal enough to their employees. ... Employees would agree, but they were busy buying Powerball tickets so they could quit their job."
"At one point, while Obama was talking about the economy, Joe Biden leaned over to House Speaker Paul Ryan and whispered something that they both laughed about. Biden said it was a private joke between two statesmen, while Ryan said, 'He just whispered the word 'boobs."
"New polls found that Bernie Sanders is now ahead of Hillary Clinton among Democrats in both Iowa and New Hampshire. And even Hillary's lead in national polls is dwindling. I don't want to say Hillary is upset, but this morning she was spotted shouting into a volcano, 'You said we had a deal!'"
"Bernie is really picking up some momentum. In fact, yesterday he received an endorsement from the progressive website, MoveOn.org. As opposed to Jeb Bush, who was endorsed by the website, NoSeriouslyMoveOn.org."
"President Obama's State of the Union address last night was focused on the wage gap, the rise of ISIS, Russia, and the danger of climate change. And House Speaker Paul Ryan, on the other hand, was focused mostly on trying to start a fire with his mind."
"President Obama said last night that he treated his last State of the Union address just like his first, because he's just as hungry. Probably because he's only been allowed to eat kale for the last seven years."
"In his final State of the Union address, President Obama said the United States should not be the world's policeman. ? He said, 'At most we should be its high school dropout security guard. That should be our role.'"
"While commenting on State of the Union, Donald Trump said President Obama is, quote, 'living in fantasy land.' Trump then went to sleep in his solid gold bed with his supermodel wife."
"Jeb Bush getting irritated these days, arguing with Trump. When asked if he would apologize to Donald Trump for calling him a jerk, Jeb Bush said, 'I don't apologize for it because he is a jerk.' Kind of reminds you of the great Lincoln-Douglas debates, doesn't it?"
"Hillary Clinton bought a Powerball ticket, and she said if she wins, she'll use the money to fund her campaign. Meanwhile, Bill Clinton said if he wins, Hillary will never see him again."
"From Charleston, South Carolina, the first Republican debate of the New Year. They whittled the group of debaters down to seven now. They're Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Ben Carson, Chris Christie, Jeb Bush, and John Kasich, which I don't know how John Kasich made it. John Kasich doesn't have enough support to get voted prom king at a small-town high school, but somehow he made the main debate."
"Now, if you're like me, you taped your TV show earlier tonight, and right now you're at home on the couch with a cocktail made of equal parts Bourbon and Mucinex - I call it 'The Cold Fashioned' - and you just finished watching tonight's Republican debate. I bet tonight was the best one yet. Because we are just 19 days away from the first official vote at the Iowa caucuses, and winning Iowa is crucial for winning the Republican nomination. Just ask the guy who won Iowa in 2012, President Rick Santorum."
"Ladies and gentlemen, there was huge news in the race for the Republican nomination today, because Ted Cruz just received an endorsement from America's most respected political dynasty, the 'Duck Dynasty.'"
"[Referring to Hillary Clinton, who appeared Thursday on Fallon's program] Of course, we're going to talk with her about the election, and things seem to be changing all the time. In fact, a new national poll found that Jeb Bush has actually passed Marco Rubio for third place among Republicans, which means Rubio now has the same feeling as when you're running a marathon and get passed by the guy dressed as the Statue of Liberty and you go, 'Come on, even that guy, too? He's a novelty runner.'"
"A new poll shows that in the last month, Hillary Clinton's lead in Iowa has shrunk from nine percent to two percent. Meanwhile, her fake smile has grown 200 percent."
"Jeb Bush has released a new ad showing clips of mean things Donald Trump has said on the campaign trail. He also released his new campaign slogan, 'I'm telling! You're mean, and I'm telling everybody!'"
"There's a new video out showing Jeb Bush interacting with an Apple watch for the first time. And the former governor seemed shocked the watch can talk. To which the watch replied, 'I felt the same way about you!'"
"Actually, I just read that Michelle Obama is a big fan of the trendy spin class SoulCycle. ... And she sneaks out of the White House to attend private classes. She spends 45 minutes pedaling without getting anywhere. Then Barack was like, 'Try doing that for seven years.'"
"According to a new report, the most Googled question about Bernie Sanders during last night's Democratic debate was, 'Why is Bernie Sanders so popular?' Though that may have been because one person Googled it a bunch of times."
"During last night's Democratic debate, Bernie Sanders got the most speaking time, as well as the most speaking volume. Bernie Sanders talks like he always has a bad connection."
"Chris Christie said in a new interview that if elected president, he would not let the government influence what is served in school cafeterias. Or for that matter, who."
South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham on Friday endorsed Jeb Bush for president. Though I imagine getting an endorsement from Lindsey Graham is about as helpful as being backed up in a bar fight by Lindsey Graham.
"So, Republicans have been complaining for months that the Obama Administration wasn't doing enough to secure the release of the prisoners [held in Iran.] Ted Cruz called it a disgrace for this Administration to abandon Americans, and Jeb Bush said it was appalling there's been no effort to try to support the Americans held hostage by the Iranian government. And Jeb knows no effort when he sees it, because that's his campaign strategy!"
"This morning, Twitter went down for almost three hours. It wasn't good. In fact, I heard Donald Trump actually had to fax his insults to people."
"Of course, Donald Trump continues to lead in the polls, but he recently said that if he loses the election, he'll go back to building skyscrapers. When asked where he'd build them, he said, 'Right in front of the White House.'"
"In a new interview in 'Time' magazine, Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders said that he's never worn a tuxedo in his life. When asked what he got married in, Bernie said, '1879.'"
"Listen to this, [during] a recent town hall meeting, Chris Christie admitted that he's got a little bit of a crush on Adele. Which explains Adele's new song, 'Hell No.'"
"Donald Trump said in a new interview that he has a very good relationship with God. Said Trump, 'I have a great, great relationship with all my employees.'"
"Sarah Palin appeared in Iowa today to endorse Donald Trump for president. Though I think she just likes him because Trump sounds like a name she would give one of her kids. Bristol, Willow, Track, Trump."
"According to a recent poll, Hillary Clinton has a better chance than Bernie Sanders at beating Donald Trump, while Martin O'Malley still has a good chance at beating traffic."
"Donald Trump got a major endorsement today from none other than Sarah Palin. She agreed to endorse him, and he agreed to let her shoot that fuzzy animal off of his head."
"According to a new report, emails on the private server Hillary used when she was secretary of state did indeed have classified information on them. This was described as above top secret stuff, which I didn't know there was an above top secret. You think top would be top. But I guess it's like 'America's Top Model,' they're not really top."
"But the lesson here I think is the secretary of state needed a better secretary because, you know, if you told me a Clinton was going to have a scandal involving email, Hillary would not have been my first guest as to who it would have been."
"Meanwhile, Bernie Sanders is having a very good week. He doesn't even know how to use email, so that's not a problem"
"He's now leading Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire by 27 points. Bernie is very well-liked among Democratic voters. Among those likely to vote in the primary, his favorability rating is 91 percent. That is incredibly high, as are many of his supporters."
"That means there's a chance, a slim chance, but it could be Bernie Sanders versus Donald Trump in the general election. The old yellers, if you will. Can you imagine that, Sanders versus Trump? Look at these guys. Every debate would look like a commercial for the Flowbee."
"Happy Hump Day, first of all. I love Hump Day. It's a nice reminder that no matter how bad things get, the end is in sight. Unless you're talking about Donald Trump. Because nothing, but nothing will ever stop this guy."
"The Iowa caucuses are a mere two weeks away, and there was a huge development yesterday, because Donald Trump received a critical endorsement from former governor of Alaska Sarah Palin. ? I mean, you just know that John McCain is on his couch at home watching the TV like, 'Donald, dude, this is a bad idea.'"
"One person who is not getting such a ringing endorsement is Ted Cruz, whose old college roommate, Craig Mazin, has taken to Twitter to inform the world that Ted Cruz is the worst. Now, Craig Mazin wrote the movies 'The Hangover 2' and '3,' and if there is anyone on earth who can identify something as the worst, it is the guy who wrote 'The Hangover 3.'"
"You know when I first got the job to host 'The Daily Show,' people told me, 'Trevor, this is going to be hard. You'll have to study every day, because there's a presidential election going on and you can't be involved in the American political process and know nothing about it.' In fact, their exact words were, 'As an outsider, I don't know if you'll survive.' But it turns out it wasn't true. See, it turns out a lot of the presidential candidates are in the same position as I am. I feel like every day I read something in the news and I go, 'Huh, I didn't know that about the government.' And at the same time, Donald Trump is reading the same newspaper going, 'Huh, neither did I.'"
"The cover of today's 'New York Daily News' features Trump, Palin, and the headline, 'I'm With Stupid'. But hold on, guys. I'm confused. Which one isn't stupid?"
"Obviously, the big story is that, yesterday in Iowa, Sarah Palin gave a 20-minute speech to endorse Donald Trump for president, while Trump stood off to the side. Palin described Trump as a great leader, while Trump described being quiet for 20 minutes the most painful experience of his life."
"At a recent town hall event in New Hampshire, Jeb Bush said he loves his mother more than his dad, while his dad says he loves winners more than people at four percent in the race for president."
"Over on the Democratic side, Bill Clinton has begun making solo appearances to campaign for Hillary, and a lot of people are wondering if he will help or hurt the campaign. I could see both sides to the issue. ... Bill Clinton could help Hillary's chances by passing along Hillary's message. He could hurt Hillary's chances by passing along thousands of messages Hillary thought she deleted."
Bill Clinton could help Hillary's chances by helping the party. He could hurt Hillary's chances by not realizing what kind of party it is and throwing his keys into a bowl.
Bill Clinton could help Hillary's chances by reminding Americans of the success of his presidency. He could hurt Hillary's chances by reminding Americans of his sex-excess of his presidency.
"Jeb Bush misspoke during a campaign event yesterday and mistakenly called Obama's daughter Malala instead of Malia. And then when he tried to say Sasha's name, it came out, 'I don't want to run for president anymore. It's harder than I thought it would be, and I don't like it.'"
"Sen. Lindsey Graham said this week that Donald Trump is the most unelectable Republican he's seen in his lifetime. Then he walked by a mirror and said, 'Whoops, never mind! I forgot about that fellow named me.'"
"Washington, DC is supposed to be hit especially hard [by this weekend's storm]. They had an inch of snow yesterday. Traffic got so bad even President Obama's motorcade got stuck. He had to glide back to the White House on Hoverboard One."
"Jeb Bush isn't so hot right now, but he's desperately trying to stir things up. He has a new ad in which he takes aim at Donald Trump. In the ad, Bush shows a vision of the future. It's Election Day in November. Donald Trump, in this ad, is the Republican nominee for president, and he's forced to concede defeat to Hillary Clinton. And Jeb Bush says, 'It doesn't have to be that way.' He says, 'I should be the one to concede defeat to Hillary Clinton. I'd be better at it. I'd be more polite.'"
"Jeb tweeted today, 'If Donald Trump is the nominee, Hillary Clinton will be elected president. We can't let that happen.' Jeb is painting himself as the only candidate who can beat Hillary. Meanwhile, his brother George is at home painting portraits of his dog and not helping at all."
"Tonightly, Hillary Clinton's server contains dozens of highly classified messages. In response, she quickly deleted her lead over Bernie Sanders."
"A new poll shows Bernie Sanders leading Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire by 27 points. After seeing the results, Bernie was heard yelling in excitement - or talking normally. It's hard to tell sometimes. He's yelling all the time, all the time."
"Here's the latest on the election, you guys. At a Donald Trump rally in Oklahoma, Sarah Palin called President Obama a 'weak-kneed capitulator-in-chief.' When asked if she knows what a capitulator is, she said, 'Of course I do. It's one of those worms that turn into a butterfly.'"
"This week, the manager of a pizza restaurant in Iowa put up a sign that said Donald Trump could eat for free. But Trump never showed up. Shortly after, thousands of restaurants across the country put up signs saying Donald Trump could eat for free."
"A new 'People' magazine profile on Bernie Sanders said that he still does his own grocery shopping. Grocery shopping usually takes Bernie a while, because he always stops for an hour to yell at the one-percent milk."
"I saw that a new ad from Bernie Sanders uses music from Simon and Garfunkel. At first, people wondered how they got the rights, and then they looked at old photos and realized Bernie Sanders might be Garfunkel."
"Donald Trump this week questioned how Ted Cruz could forget both that he was a Canadian citizen by birth and that he once accepted a $1 million loan from Goldman Sachs. I don't know. Probably the same way someone could forget that they once supported gay marriage, universal healthcare, a wealth tax, private-sector unions, an assault weapons ban and Hillary Clinton."
"Donald Trump said today that he did not expect Sarah Palin to speak for, quote, 'that long' during her rambling endorsement speech earlier this week. She did speak for over 20 minutes. But remember, for Sarah Palin, that's only three sentences."
"Music icon Cher said recently Donald Trump can't come up with a hairstyle that looks human, how could he come up with a plan to defeat ISIS? So if you're looking for a plan to defeat ISIS, I wouldn't count on Cher, either."
"Yesterday, Lindsey Graham criticized Donald Trump and Ted Cruz and said choosing between them is like having to choose between being shot or poisoned. Graham is supporting Jeb Bush, which he said is like choosing to be slowly suffocated by an expensive pillow."
"Someone found lyrics to a song written about Donald Trump's father, and Donald was like, 'Big deal. Pink Floyd did an entire album about me called The Wall, and I made them pay for it.'"
"In a People magazine profile, Bernie Sanders revealed he proposed to his wife in a Friendly's parking lot. A lot of the other candidates have come up with interesting stories about how they got engaged as well. Donald Trump said, 'I got down on one knee and told Melania, You're hot, I'm rich. Let's do this.'"
"I heard that Chris Christie left the campaign trail in New Hampshire to return home to New Jersey to deal with the snowstorm. Of course, what do you expect to happen when you tell Chris Christie there's a large 'Blizzard' waiting for him?"
"It's been reported that former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is considering running for president as an independent candidate this year. So, in addition to Bush, Rubio and Cruz, that'll make four candidates who can speak Spanish. [Fallon showed a clip of Bloomberg speaking broken Spanish.] Even immigrants are like, 'Speak English.

"Jeb Bush joked in a new interview that he'd like to appear in a G-rated episode of the Showtime series 'Homeland' and would like his character to kill a terrorist with his bare hands. So, I think Jeb might be a little confused about what can be in a G-rated movie. Also, I don't think Donald Trump is technically a terrorist."
"It's already the last week of January, which means we're just seven days away from the Iowa caucuses. It's that special season when we pretend to know what a caucus is. Even though we're so close, the GOP still hasn't rallied around one candidate. The two frontrunners, Cruz and Trump, of course, are known by their celebrity couple name, 'Crump.'"
"Donald Trump still holds a commanding lead in national polls, so the GOP establishment is lining up behind him, to push him in front of a train."
"We're just a week away from the Iowa caucuses and all the candidates are doing whatever they can to appeal to voters. Donald Trump even went to a church service in Iowa over the weekend. You can tell he doesn't go to church much, 'cause he was like, 'I really like the part where they passed me the basket of free money.'"
"Last night, CNN hosted a Democratic forum where Hillary Clinton said that if she's elected, she wants to work together with Republicans, and even said she'd give them all bear hugs. By bear hugs, she means like the ones you saw in 'The Revenant.'"
"Actually, last night Hillary Clinton said that candidates campaign in poetry and govern in prose, and said our country needs more poetry right now. Then she even had a poem prepared as an example of what she was talking about. Take a look at this. 'I'm a strong and inspiring female. I will pay attention to detail. This is my promise, I will be honest, except when it comes to my email.'"
"The Iowa caucuses are less than a week away. Then after that, the candidates can go back to ignoring Iowa completely. But for now, it's all they care about. It's weird we give so much attention to who Iowa picks. Since 1980, the Iowa caucus has predicted the Republican nominee incorrectly four times. They only got it right twice. You get better odds when you have a zoo animal predict the winner of the Super Bowl than these Iowa caucuses."
"But on CNN last night, they had what they call a town hall meeting, where the Democratic candidates try to woo the Iowa voters. The only clear winner of this debate-slash-meeting was the farmer who got 30 grand to let CNN park the satellite trucks in his corn field. My favorite part of the night was when Hillary put her hands around Bernie's throat and screamed, 'Why won't you die!'"
"They took questions from the people in the audience. And someone asked Hillary who her favorite president was, and she said, 'With apologies to President Obama and my husband, Bill, my favorite is Abraham Lincoln.' And then Bernie Sanders said, 'Senator, I knew Abraham Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln was a friend of mine. And you, ma'am, are no Abraham Lincoln.'"
"Martin O'Malley, who for some reason is still under the impression he's running for president, got some good shots in. But this was his big moment. During the Q&A portion, he said, 'I can't just sit here. I have to take off my jacket and stand up.' And he rolled up his sleeves and showed off his body. It's like 'Magic Martin.'"
"Donald Trump, as you probably know, is refusing to take part in the debate on Fox News tomorrow night because Megyn Kelly, one of the moderators there, is someone he does not like. In fact, this morning he tweeted, 'I refuse to call Megyn Kelly a bimbo because that would not be politically correct. Instead I will only call her a lightweight reporter.' Well, that's considerate at least. By the way, he said that at 5:45 am. This is what he woke up thinking. This was in his brain at 5:45 - you have to hand it to him, Trump insults more women by 6:00 am than most people do all year."
"The reason that he doesn't like her - he claims Megyn Kelly is unfair, which makes sense. Fox News, you know, has a long and dark history of being unfair to Republicans."
"[Referring to Trump's decision not to attend Fox News debate] But, either way, I have to believe Jeb Bush is excited. It's like when the bully stays home sick from school. You get one day of not getting beat up."
"Tonightly, rapper B.O.B goes on an anti-science Twitter spree, claiming the earth is flat. As a result, he's currently polling third in the Republican presidential race."
"Undocumented immigrants in Flint, Michigan, are being forced to drink lead-poisoned water. Or as Donald Trump calls it, 'Phase one.'"
"Donald Trump announced that he is not going to participate in the Fox News debate tomorrow night. The other candidates are really excited to present their views in a serious yet respectful manner, which means they haven't been told that nobody's going to watch this one."
"Trump says that he's not going to the Fox News debate because moderator Megyn Kelly is biased against him. And Trump has a right to be scared because usually when a younger, attractive woman disagrees with him, she ends up taking half his stuff."
"Of course, the other candidates have some pretty strong opinions about Trump not being in the debate. Check it out. Ted Cruz said, 'Good.' Marco Rubio said, 'Good.' Ben Carson said, 'Good.' Rand Paul said, 'Good.' Finally, Chris Christie said, 'Food - I mean, good.'"
"Over at a town hall in Iowa, a voter asked Hillary Clinton how her views align with the Ten Commandments, and she said that, quote, 'In many areas, judgment should be left to God.' Then God was like, 'Okay, you really shouldn't have deleted all those emails. I'm just saying.'"
"Donald Trump's campaign released a statement announcing he will boycott tomorrow's debate, saying, 'Roger Ailes and Fox News think they can toy with him, but, Mr. Trump doesn't play games.' A statement that would carry a lot more weight if Trump hadn't literally hosted a game show."
"Following Donald Trump's decision to boycott tomorrow's debate. Ted Cruz says Trump is afraid to face moderator Megyn Kelly, because if she asks him mean questions, his hair might stand on end. And that's a sight no one wants to see."
"After Donald Trump's decision to boycott tomorrow's debate, Jeb Bush told Trump to stop whining. Although, I think what he meant to say was, 'Stop winning. Just stop winning.'"
"Dr. Ben Carson said today that although Donald Trump has announced he will boycott the debate, Carson wouldn't be surprised if he did show up. Then again, it's Ben Carson. He wouldn't be surprised if he was licked awake in the morning by a unicorn."
A recent poll found that Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have the most recognizable faces of the 2016 campaign. While Mike Huckabee and Chris Christie just have the most face.
"Earlier tonight on Fox News - the Republican presidential debate without Donald Trump, which to quote the great crooner from the '80s, Orange Juice Jones, is kind of like Corn Flakes without the milk."
"Trump, as you probably know, refused to appear in the debate because of a dispute he's having with Fox News and one of their hosts, Megyn Kelly. Trump has had a problem with Megyn Kelly ever since she followed him back to his cottage in the woods and found out his real name is Trumpelstiltskin."
"So he refused to be part of the broadcast tonight. He's like the kid who took his ball and went home, and he tweeted, 'The debate tonight will be a total disaster, low ratings with advertisers and advertising rates dropping like a rock. I hate to see this.' I'm sure it's really tearing him up inside to see it. If this were WWE, Donald Trump would have shown up in Iowa tonight with a mask and a folding chair and just started beating everyone over the head."
"Dr. Ben Carson was also not present for the debate. I mean, he was there. He participated. But he just wasn't present."
"Trump got a major endorsement this week from the Rev. Jerry Falwell Jr. When Trump visited his school, Liberty University, Falwell said, this is a quote, 'In my opinion, Donald Trump lives a life of loving and helping others as Jesus taught.' You know, yeah, he does remind me a lot of Jesus, the same kind of humility. It does seem strange that a Christian leader would endorse a candidate who's kind of a poster child for the seven deadly sins."
"Meanwhile, over on the Democratic side, Bernie Sanders is acting a little Donald Trump-y, as Sanders said he wants more debates, but not on Hillary Clinton's terms. He wants them on his own terms. Specifically, he wants each debate to be two hours long with a half-hour break in the middle so he can watch 'Wheel of Fortune.' And they also cannot be scheduled on nights when he has his hip-hop dance classes."
"Trump is skipping the debate because Megyn Kelly will be a moderator. After all, why would he want to practice going head-to-head with a strong blond woman?"
"Fox News stood by Megyn Kelly, and I don't blame them. A news channel cannot let a politician decide who they put on the air. That's what ratings are for."
"Speaking of old creeps, tonight was caucus night in Iowa. The candidates for president have been camped out for what seems like weeks trying to get votes in what is the first real test of their electability. Donald Trump has been in and out of Iowa. He had a rally at the airport in Dubuque over the weekend. While waiting for him to show up, one of his supporters led the crowd in the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag, even though they had no flag there. When he says we need to make America great again, that is what he's talking about. We need flags."
"The Iowa caucuses are an important part of our election process. There are a few key differences between a caucus and a primary election. First one is, no one knows what a caucus is or how it works. Even in Iowa, they don't know. They just wander around nodding at each other."
"Ted Cruz caused some controversy with a mailer his campaign sent out. This showed up in the mail:'Election alert, voter violation, time-sensitive documents.' Inside was a report card listing names of other people in the person's neighborhood and giving them grades. They all got 55 percent. ... The Iowa Secretary of State said it misrepresents Iowa election law. Sarah Palin, who's a friend of Ted Cruz, said the mailers were offensive and shameful. And Donald Trump said it is one of the most disgraceful things he's ever seen in politics. Then he said all Mexicans are drug dealers and that Carly Fiorina's face turns children to stone."
"But the caucus has been caulked, it's over. The candidates, I guess, go from pretending to care about Iowa to pretending to care about New Hampshire next, and so on."
"Tonight we will finally find out who has been elected president of Iowa. ... And because Iowa votes first, the candidates have been spending a lot of time there. ... More than $70 million has been spent on campaign ads in Iowa, alone, including $15 million by Jeb Bush's super PAC. And yet, Jeb's still polling below four percent. And some people are surprised, but it makes sense to me that ads can't help that much. Because if they did, the 2016 caucus would be won by Flo, the Progressive lady."
"Last night, as I'm sure you know, was caucus night in Iowa. Ted Cruz was the winner on the Republican side. He got 28 percent of the vote. Donald Trump, who was expected to win, came in second with 24 percent. And Marco Rubio is right behind him. He had 23 percent, to come in third. Which is pretty good considering the fact that most Iowa voters think that Marco Rubio is a game you play in the swimming pool."
"Meanwhile, Jeb Bush finished in sixth place with three percent of the vote. He reportedly spent upwards of $2,800 per vote. In other words, for every vote he got, he could have purchased nine hoverboards."
"There's a photo finish for the Democrats. Hillary Clinton edged out Bernie Sanders 49.8 percent to 49.6 percent. Hillary did especially well among women, and she swept the African-American vote in Iowa. She got both of those votes."
Mike Huckabee and Martin O'Malley dropped out of the race. And it's always sad when you drop out of a race no one knew you were running in.
"Last night's Democratic caucus was super close. Hillary won by three-tenths of one percent. Or as it's known in Iowa, Carl."
"If you thought last night's Democratic caucus was essentially a toss-up, in some places it literally was. Yes, a coin toss. In six precincts, the Democrats picked the winner the same way roommates decide who has to drive to Taco Bell. ... And Hillary won all six of the coin tosses. With that kind of coin flipping prowess, forget the Democrats - the Broncos should draft Hillary for the Super Bowl on Sunday."
"Ladies and gentlemen, if you're watching this right now, we are entering hour 26 of Ted Cruz's victory speech from the Iowa caucuses last night."
"Ted Cruz won first place and gave a 32-minute speech. To be fair, 31 of those minutes were just people shouting, 'Really? Him?! This guy? We're going with this guy? We're kidding! I did it as a joke!'"
"Ted Cruz's victory last night raises a lot of questions. Like, one, 'Can he keep this momentum going into New Hampshire?' And two, 'Just how much does it cost to move to Canada?'"
"After the caucus in Iowa, the candidates who had no chance to win are finally starting to realize that and drop out. Rick Santorum announced he's suspending his campaign, after he finished eleventh in Iowa. Rand Paul is suspending his campaign, after finishing fifth. I like that they call it suspending, as if their campaigns got caught having sex under the bleachers and will be back in a couple of weeks."
"I think Rand Paul deserves a lot of credit. He said time and time again he believes in smaller government, and now that he's out of the race, the government is indeed one person smaller. So that's called practicing what you preach."
"Jeb Bush finished sixth behind Rand Paul, who dropped out. But Jeb Bush is still running. He doesn't know what to do. You know, if he loses, he can't go home because his father and brother will laugh at him. So he's just got to stay."
"Hillary Clinton is trying to position herself as the underdog in New Hampshire, which is funny considering the fact that she's running against Mr. Magoo."
"Donald Trump is reportedly on the list of nominees for the Nobel Peace Prize. ... I say it's about time we honor the man who settled the great Gary Busey/Meatloaf conflict of 2012. This is the Nobel Peace Prize. Donald Trump is so committed to peace, he's got one on his head, folks."
"Folks, I don't want to bring up any painful memories, but on Monday, they held the Iowa caucus. And this year they held it in the traditional state of Iowa. And the winners were Hillary Clinton and Ted Cruz. I'm not sure what they won, but I'm guessing it's deep-fried."
"On Monday, Dr. Paul came in fifth in the Iowa caucus, with only 4.5 percent of the vote. You would think being an eye doctor he would've seen this coming. Alas, people had such high hopes for Rand winning, in that those who hoped were clearly high. But Senator Paul should take some comfort in living up to his father's legacy of also not being president."
"Also tossed on the funeral pyre of politics this week was Democratic candidate Martin O'Malley. Or as you may know him, 'Do I know him?'"
"And finally, we must honor our last fallen tribute, former Virginia governor and not president of the United States, Jim Gilmore. When the votes were counted in Iowa, Gilmore won 12. Not 12 percent. Not 12 delegates. Twelve people. That's fewer than the members of Chumbawumba."
"On Monday, Hillary Clinton narrowly won in Iowa, with the final results showing that she beat Bernie Sanders by less than one percent. And you thought Bernie was mad at the one percent before."
"Actually, Hillary is facing criticism for declaring victory in Iowa prematurely. ... The final results weren't actually announced until around 1:00 pm. on Tuesday, but she declared victory back in April of last year. People got a little ticked off."
"Over on the Republican side, Ted Cruz made history by becoming the first Hispanic to win the Iowa caucus. Then Cruz said, 'And the first Canadian - I mean, nothing.'"
"The big story in Iowa that everyone's talking about has to be Donald Trump, who didn't win. He actually came in second to Ted Cruz. And after Trump's second-place finish, people started retweeting one of his tweets from 2013 that says, 'No one remembers who came in second.' Even Kanye West was like, 'You got to be careful what you put on Twitter, man.'"
"Ted Cruz and Hillary Clinton were named the winners of Monday's Iowa caucuses. Cruz celebrated by giving a speech to his supporters, and Hillary celebrated by moving her stuff into the White House."
"On the Republican side in the Iowa caucuses, Ted Cruz came in first, Donald Trump came in second, and Jeb Bush is still lost in a corn maze."
"Hillary Clinton told supporters on Monday that after her close win in Iowa, she breathed a big sigh of relief. Unfortunately, when she did, she burned down an old barn."
"President Obama today made his first visit to a mosque while in office. He visited a mosque, which means he's officially entered the phase of his presidency known as, 'Come at me, bro!'"
"After Donald Trump finished second in the Iowa caucuses, an old Trump tweet spread across the Internet, in which he quoted golfer Walter Hagen as saying, 'No one remembers who comes in second.' And that's not the only old Trump tweet that looks embarrassing now. For instance, last year he tweeted, 'Star Wars:The Force Awakens will be a huge box office dud.' And the year before that, he tweeted, 'Nothing quenches my thirst like a tall glass of Flint water.' Back in 2012, he tweeted, 'The Cosby Show is great and will endure forever.' Got to be careful. They come back to haunt you."
"Donald Trump not taking his Iowa loss very well. ? This morning Donald Trump tweeted that Ted Cruz illegally stole the election. Trump said, 'Everyone knows you're supposed to illegally buy the election.'"
"This is stunning. This week, Mike Huckabee, Rand Paul, and Rick Santorum all decided to drop out of the race. Which explains Jeb Bush's new campaign slogan, 'I can't take a hint.'"
"Bernie Sanders says his campaign is trying to appeal to senior citizens. The problem is, every time he says 'Feel the Bern,' seniors think he's talking about acid reflux."
"Earlier tonight in New Hampshire, there was another debate between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. They've already had so many debates they're starting to run out of things to fight about. Tonight they sat there quietly like an old married couple at a restaurant."
"Ted Cruz's wife revealed that the way Ted alleviates stress is by singing show tunes. For real. Whenever he's feeling anxious or overwhelmed, like right before a debate, he calls her and sings Broadway show tunes into the telephone. But make no mistake - he still believes that marriage is a sacred union between one guy and one doll, okay?"
"Some people get very excited about the candidate they support. And there are tattoo shops now in, I think, Vermont and New Hampshire, giving people free tattoos of Bernie Sanders, or at least part of him. And if you're a supporter on the other side, you can get a very poorly drawn tattoo of Donald Trump, which looks more like a bloated Martin Sheen."
"Donald Trump accuses Ted Cruz of stealing Iowa. 'He didn't earn it,' says the rich guy who inherited his fortune."
"I saw that Donald Trump's plane made an emergency landing in Nashville yesterday, after reporting engine problems. When asked what the issue was, the pilot said, 'Nothing, I just couldn't take it anymore.'"
"Ted Cruz's wife recently said that Ted calls her to sing Broadway show tunes over the phone in order to relax before debates. When asked which songs, she said, 'Who knows, I let it go to voice mail.'"
"Bernie Sanders yesterday interrupted his own speech to rush to the aid of a man who fainted in the audience. Luckily, Bernie was able to shout him back to consciousness."
Trump said in a new interview that President Obama visited a mosque yesterday because he feels comfortable there. Or maybe it's just because it's the one place Obama knew he'd never run into Donald Trump.
Ted Cruz's wife said at a rally yesterday that Cruz will randomly call her cell phone to serenade her with Broadway show tunes. She just wishes they weren't always songs from 'Sweeney Todd.'
"Of course, last night was the first one on one debate between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. And I don't want to say things got tense between the two of them, but one guy was like, 'Please lower your voices.'"
"At the debate, Hillary Clinton addressed the controversy of her personal email server and said she has no concerns about it whatsoever. Democrats are like, 'Yeah, that's what concerns us. Why does that not bother you?'"
Hillary also told Bernie Sanders that it's time for his campaign to 'end the very artful smear' against her. Incidentally 'very artful smear' is also how Bernie orders a bagel.
"Bernie Sanders now holds a double digit lead in New Hampshire polls over Hillary Clinton. Bernie says he's taking every precaution he can against Hillary by running ads, giving speeches, and having someone else start his car in the morning."
"Over on the Republican side, Donald Trump shot an interview with Fox News and he said he has never smoked marijuana. Trump said, 'I don't want to get paranoid and start thinking people are sneaking into our country and stealing our jobs.'"
"Oh, and George W Bush is now appearing in campaign ads supporting his brother Jeb's presidential campaign. Jeb says, it hopes it will him help win over a very specific group of undecided voters, his parents."
"I saw that the unemployment rate in the US just fell below five percent, which is the lowest it's been in eight years. When asked for a comment on the number of unemployed Americans, Obama said, 'I can't wait to be one of them.'"
"Chris Christie, in a new interview, continued to criticize Marco Rubio for his performance in this weekend's debate, and said Rubio is scripted and not spontaneous. To which Marco Rubio replied, 'That's not true, comma. I speak from the heart, exclamation point.'"
"Donald Trump said this weekend he feels the Iowa caucus results were very unfair, to himself and Dr. Ben Carson. Other things Trump considers unfair to him include Google, sidewalks, shoe laces, oxygen, and dame Judy Dench."
"Considering this was the eighth Republican debate, you may have expected things to be running like a well-oiled machine by now. Instead, the night began with the precision of a kindergarten holiday pageant, led by Ben Carson, who somehow missed his cue to take the stage. Is Ben Carson really a brain surgeon, or did people start calling him that sarcastically, and it just stuck? 'Oh, yeah, that guy's a real brain surgeon.'"
"There is a real excitement in the air because the presidential race has truly become a flaming toboggan ride toward dead man's curve, otherwise known as the New Hampshire primary. Tomorrow, the Granite State weighs in, and all eyes have been on Marco Rubio, who stunned all the politicos when he won Iowa by coming in third. ... But despite the 'Rube-mentum,' the senator may have tripped up in Saturday's debate by sticking too closely to his talking points. ... Rubio repeated the same phrase so many times he summoned Candyman, who appeared behind him and killed his campaign."
"Of course, today was the New Hampshire primary. This is a big deal. ...All the candidates spent the day with their supporters, except for Ben Carson, who's still waiting in the hallway."
"Not only was today the New Hampshire primary, it was also National Pizza Day. So, one way or the other, Chris Christie will be giving a victory speech."
"Well, it seems that as the campaign wears on, the candidates are really starting to go at it. In fact, Jeb Bush recently told supporters that he thinks Donald Trump, quote, 'needs therapy.' At first, Trump was insulted, but then when he heard it would be an hour of talking about himself, he was like, 'Sign me up.'"
"The New Hampshire primary was today, and in Dixville Notch - the first town to complete voting - Republican candidate John Kasich won, beating Donald Trump by just one vote. Honestly, I'm kinda surprised Trump didn't win in a place called Dixville."
Jeb Bush was caught on video yesterday throwing a snowball at an NBC reporter in New Hampshire. Though Jeb says the snowball was just meant to represent his chances of winning.
"A new poll out shows Hillary Clinton with just a three-point lead over Bernie Sanders nationally. Though she's actually up by 50 points, if you go by blood pressure."
"Chris Christie, at a campaign stop yesterday, got down on one knee to try and woo an undecided voter. And by 'woo' I mean that's the sound he made when he knelt down."
"During a campaign stop, a New Hampshire bar offered Marco Rubio what they called a Marco Rubio burger. It's called the Marco Rubio burger because Chris Christie eats it for lunch!"
"Following accusations that he has an overly rehearsed speaking style, Marco Rubio was chased to his campaign bus by a group of protesters dressed as robots and calling themselves 'Marco Roboto' and the 'Rubio Talking Point 3000.' So one thing's for sure - unemployment is still a major problem."
"This is the 100th anniversary of the New Hampshire primary. They've been doing this primary in New Hampshire since Bernie Sanders was five years old, if you can imagine that."
Bernie is very popular in New Hampshire. Hillary Clinton today spent the whole day quietly Googling the words 'life expectancy for old man in snowy weather.'
"There was quite a bit of snow in New Hampshire. But the candidates, they didn't let that get them down. Jeb Bush and John Kasich had fun. Here's Jeb throwing snowballs. Here's Kasich throwing snowballs. Those snowballs they're throwing, those are the ones that don't have a chance in hell in this election."
"Now, in 2008 Hillary Clinton beat Barack Obama in New Hampshire, even though he eventually went on to win the nomination. This time, Bernie Sanders is leading Hillary by a large margin. So he could be our next openly-resentful secretary of state."
"But the real race is on the Republican side, where each candidate is desperate to prove they're the one who can make Barack Obama a two-term president."
"Last night half the state of New Hampshire declared officially that they want the host of 'Celebrity Apprentice' to run America, and they weren't joking. Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders won their respective party primaries. It was a great night for loud men with crazy hair."
"On the Republican side, Gov. John Kasich came out of nowhere to finish second despite the fact that no one has any idea who he is."
"According to the exit polls, Trump and Sanders were the number one choice among white voters, and since that's the only kind of voter they have in New Hampshire, it worked out well."
"Ted Cruz, who won the Iowa caucus, finished third. Jeb Bush was fourth. Marco Rubio came in fifth. Chris Christie came in sixth. Carly Fiorina finished seventh. Fiorina and Christie bowed out of the race today. Fiorina said she's dropping out in order to spend more time chasing the 101 Dalmatians."
"Chris Christie is already back home in New Jersey. I'll tell you what, I would not want to be the family-sized variety pack of Klondike bars that has been hiding in his freezer right now."
"Jeb spent a lot of money to finish fourth in New Hampshire. The Bush campaign spent - I saw reports that they spent $1,200 per vote. The truth is that only worked out to be $6,000. But for that much money, he could have sent every one of his supporters an iPad and a pair of Louboutins."
"Jeb had his mother campaigning for him. His brother did an ad for him, and he still came in fourth. He's already pulled out all the stops. The only thing left to do now is stop."
"Meanwhile, over on the Democratic side, Bernie Sanders beat Hillary Clinton 60 percent to 38 percent. Hillary accepted defeat graciously. She congratulated Sen. Sanders, vowed to fight harder, and then strangled an unfortunate intern who got a little bit too close to her when the results came in."
"Last night in the Granite State, Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump each crushed their competition by 20 points, turning our entire political system upside down. ? Even though [political analysts] said they saw it coming, they're disappointed in the voters. The 'Huffington Post' huffed 'WTF GOP?' And the cover of the '[New York] Daily News' today was 'Dawn of the Brain Dead'. ? I think I know what is going on here. It is almost Valentine's Day, and the heart wants what it wants. America has been told for years to pick a sensible candidate, the responsible one, a buddy, a pal, great on paper. ? But now it is getting swept off its feet by a couple of bad boys from the wrong side of the polls."
"One candidate who did not do so well last night is the winner of the 2016 presidential election, Hillary Clinton, and even she knows why. ? She is not reaching young people. So, she is trying a new tactic:disappointed mom. 'I know you are mad at me right now, but I still love you. It's okay if you need to be the bad guy. Just know that at the end of the day, I am the one who is taking care of you. Not your cool, 74-year-old father [referring to Sanders] who you hang out with on weekends.'"
"Just like in Iowa, some of last night's biggest winners were the losers, and the winningest loser of all was Ohio governor - and your school's second-favorite shop teacher - John Kasich."
"As I'm sure you know, the New Hampshire primary was held last night. Donald Trump won in a blowout on the Republican side. I wish that was a joke that we had written, but that's what actually happened."
Now I know people are worried about Donald Trump. But...I think this whole Trump thing is just going to blow over by his reelection in 2020.
"But after last night, it looks like Chris Christie is out after this primary, which isn't surprising. Like myself, he doesn't look like the kind of guy who wins a lot of races."
"Jeb Bush came in fourth place. He came in fourth place, but he told CNN that he considers that a win. ... Is it possible for a man to be sadder than Jeb Bush? We are a week away from Jeb Bush walking on stage at the debate just wearing sweat pants, eating cereal directly out of the box and just going, 'Oh, what's the point.'"
"Of course, Bernie Sanders won on the Democratic side last night. But Hillary was so close. She was so close. She was only two million coin tosses short of winning."
"But the real story of last night's primary was John Kasich, who out of nowhere managed to take second place with Republicans. ? John Kasich has been running for president for a full year now, and finally last night 23 percent of all Republicans in the state of New Hampshire said, 'Sure, whatever. He'll do.'"
"But it seems like Kasich's major selling point is that he's not Trump, Cruz or Jeb. I think that should be his main platform. Like his slogan should just be:'John Kasich:Not Those Other Dudes.'"
"Of course, the big news is the New Hampshire primaries, which were held last night, and I want to say congratulations to Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump on winning for each of their parties. In his speech, Bernie said he couldn't have done it without the support of millions of Americans, while Trump was like, 'This was all me. You losers did nothing.'"
"One of the big surprises last night was Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who came in second for the Republicans. Some celebrities are even starting to support him, even Arnold Schwarzenegger. However a spokesman for Schwarzenegger said it's not an actual endorsement. When asked why, Schwarzenegger was like, 'Because even I'm afraid of Hillary.'"
"Might sound a little far-fetched, but Kasich is actually a lot closer to being 'The Terminator' than any of the other candidates. Let's see how they stack up. First, for the Terminator, 'Hasta la vista, baby' is his catchphrase. For Donald Trump 'Hasta la vista, babies' is his immigration plan."
The Terminator will stop at nothing to accomplish his mission. Ben Carson will stop at nothing in the middle of a hallway.
The Terminator is befriended by human companions. Ted Cruz wishes he knew what that felt like.
The Terminator is a robot from the future here to kill John Connor. Marco Rubio is a robot from the present here to kill his chances of being president.
"Finally, the Terminator is defeated by a guy from the year 2029. Hillary Clinton is defeated by a guy from the year 1929."
"Bernie Sanders beat Hillary Clinton last night in New Hampshire in nearly every voter demographic, including older white voters, younger white voters - and that's all they have in New Hampshire."
"Following his victory in New Hampshire, Bernie Sanders has become the first Jewish candidate in US history to win a primary. Afterwards, Bernie held a press conference where he answered questions with a question."
"According to Google, Ben Carson was the least-searched-for Republican candidate during yesterday's New Hampshire's primary, mostly because he's standing right where we left him."
"Before officially dropping out of the race, Chris Christie told reporters he wanted to go home to take a deep breath after his sixth-place finish in New Hampshire. I guess he momentarily forgot that home is New Jersey."
Australian wildlife officials this week discovered a rare albino turtle making its way out of its mother's nest. It's being called 'Jeb.'
"[President] Obama is in town [referring to Los Angeles] for a couple of fundraisers, which - why does he still need money? He does know he can't run again, right? Why is he raising funds? Does he need money for cigarettes?"
"In his victory speech after the New Hampshire primary, Donald Trump claimed the unemployment rate might actually be as high as 42 percent. He might be right, because Hillary [Clinton] just fired her entire campaign staff."
"It's been a rough week for Hillary after Bernie Sanders won the New Hampshire primary by more than 20 points. Bernie said he's always liked New Hampshire, especially because he was around when it was still Old Hampshire."
"A new poll released this week shows that two-thirds of Canadians fear a Donald Trump presidency, especially one Canadian in particular [referring to Sen. Ted Cruz]."
"Before winning the Republican primary in New Hampshire, it seemed like Donald Trump was really going after Jeb Bush. Did you feel that way? In fact, he recently made fun of Jeb Bush for having his mom help him with his campaign. This is real. This is an actual tweet from Trump. It said, 'Wow, Jeb Bush, whose campaign is a total disaster, had to bring in mommy to take a slap at me. Not nice.' As you can imagine, Barbara Bush wasn't too happy about it. She decided to respond with her own tweet. 'Hey, T-bag, you got something to say, say it to my face, #RealTalk, #Bushwhack.'"
"I want to say Happy 63rd Birthday to Jeb Bush. Happy Birthday, Jeb. In honor of his big day, a lot of people wrote on his Facebook wall. Check out what they posted. First up, Donald Trump wrote, 'You call this a wall? This is a sorry excuse for a wall.'"
"After that, Bernie Sanders wrote, 'Maybe you should focus less on your birthday and more on sharing your cake with the 99 percent of Americans who don't have a birthday today.'"
"Next up, Marco Rubio wrote, 'Happy Birthday. Hope it's a good one. Happy Birthday. Hope it's a good one. Happy Birthday. Hope it's a good one.'"
"And finally, Ben Carson wrote, 'I'm standing outside with a present for you. Just call my name when you want me to walk in and I'll definitely walk over.'"
"Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders earlier tonight faced off in a debate on PBS, or as PBS calls it, 'Antiques Roadshow.'"
"Chris Christie announced yesterday that he's dropping out of the presidential race. Christie said he's not sure what he'll do now, and then someone reminded him he's still the governor of New Jersey."
"Bernie Sanders, yesterday, had breakfast in Harlem with the Rev. Al Sharpton. Interesting. Usually when an old white guy goes out to Harlem, it's because he fell asleep on the train."
"Former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg recently ran two national polls to gauge interest for his possible presidential campaign. You're still gauging? Buddy, the two hottest candidates are the Jewish guy and the billionaire. Do you need an engraved invitation?"
"Marco Rubio has revealed that he cracked his molar while eating a Twix bar yesterday. Twix, of course, is Rubio's favorite candy bar, because you get to eat the same thing twice."
"Ben Carson said he's open to being Donald Trump's vice president. Makes sense. Carson could deliver Trump the black Republican vote, which consists of Ben Carson."
"In addition to the [Los Angeles] marathon, I also saw that President Obama just visited LA. Or as Donald Trump put it, 'The state is being taken over by Kenyans.'"
"Actually, while he was in Los Angeles last week, President Obama met privately with Will Smith. Not to be outdone, Joe Biden spent the day learning how to do the Carlton."
"Donald Trump just promised that he will no longer use foul language on the campaign trail. Now, when people ask him his policy on ISIS, he just says, 'I'm gonna bomb the shy diddly doodles out of them.'"
"During a recent rally in Louisiana, Donald Trump actually autographed someone's baby. Even crazier, when he handed the baby back to the parents, he said, 'Congratulations, your baby is worth three times as much now.'"
Ted Cruz's campaign pulled a recent attack ad after it came out that one of the actresses in the ad had also appeared in some softcore porn films. I feel so bad for that actress who now has to explain to her parents what she was doing in a Ted Cruz ad.
"Republicans and Democrats are fighting over whether President Obama should be able to appoint Justice Scalia's successor. Democrats say that he should, whereas the Constitution says that he shall."
The Ted Cruz campaign has pulled a new ad after it was revealed that the actress in it has appeared in softcore porn. And now Jeb has hired her to teach him how to act like he's enjoying something.
Donald Trump spent his President's Day getting ready by photoshopping his head onto a million-dollar bill.
"Meanwhile, in a very different kind of race in LA:the LA marathon, the 31st annual marathon. Between the marathon and Obama's visit, it was a big week for Kenyans screwing up LA traffic."
"During his speech at the rally [in South Carolina], George W. Bush said his brother Jeb is the guy who can fix the problems that inflame our country's frustrations. Or in other words, Jeb is America's 'Preparation H.'"
"According to the latest national poll, Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders has narrowed to ten points. Also narrowed:Hillary Clinton's eyes."
"A new poll has found that 31 percent of Donald Trump supporters in South Carolina would support a ban on homosexuals immigrating to the US. Oh, yeah, because that's what all cool, gay Europeans dream of:South Carolina."
"CNN has released an article comparing the Republican candidates to used cars, which likened John Kasich to a family-friendly minivan. And here are some of the other candidates. Ben Carson is a Prius. You can hardly hear it running."
"Bernie Sanders has been fighting an uphill battle against Hillary Clinton. And Donald Trump is battling with anyone who makes eye contact with him, which means the only one who's safe is Ben Carson."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the South Carolina primary is on Saturday, and the candidates are doing everything they can to get noticed. Now Jeb Bush hasn't been doing too well in the primaries. He finished fourth in New Hampshire, but yesterday it seemed like he had finally changed his image and summed up his vision for America in a single tweet. Here's the tweet. It is a gun with his name on it, and the caption just says 'America.' Although he could have just captioned it, 'Now will you like me?'"
"Jeb is making a lot of changes. His new gun-toting image isn't the only change because after saying he would never ditch his glasses, this week Jeb appeared wearing contact lenses. And I have to say, the new look really suits his tougher image. Most people actually do look cooler without glasses. Jeb looks like a turtle who has lost his shell."
"Also, like, is anyone else worried that Jeb got rid of his glasses the same week he got a gun? It feels like someone is about to get shot."
"Hillary Clinton had a coughing fit during a speech, and the crowd actually chanted her name as she opened a cough drop. She got applause for choking, or as Jeb put it, 'Must be nice.'"
"Got my first robo-call this week. Said, 'Hi, this is Bill Clinton. Can Hillary count on you?' Count on me? She can't even count on Bill. Don't drag me into your marital problems, pal."
"This email problem continues to dog Hillary, but she says it's just an honest mistake. You ever notice the only time people in Washington are honest is when they make a mistake? Why is that?"
"Well, after his big win in New Hampshire, they say Hillary's team is trying to dig up dirt on Bernie Sanders. You know what you call someone who digs up dirt on Bernie Sanders? An archaeologist."
But the big decision for Sanders will be picking a vice president. It's important because whoever he chooses is just a prostate away from being the next president of the United States.
"Pope Francis loudly scolded a fan in Mexico yesterday after the man grabbed his arm and pulled him down. And after hearing that the Pope yelled at a Mexican, Donald Trump converted to Catholicism."
"Donald Trump supporters have filed a lawsuit challenging Ted Cruz's eligibility to become president because they claim he is not a natural-born citizen. Okay, that's fair, but just please point to one thing on this guy [referring to Donald Trump] that's natural."
"Donald Trump, at a recent campaign rally, said that he has never met a human being who has lied as much as Ted Cruz. Then [Trump's wife] Melania said, 'You tell him, handsome.'"

"Donald Trump, at a recent campaign rally, said that he has never met a human being who has lied as much as Ted Cruz. Then [Trump's wife] Melania said, 'You tell him, handsome.'"
"In South Carolina, things are looking up for Ted Cruz. Ted Cruz - for the first time - is ahead of Donald Trump in a national poll. Of course, Trump is suing the poll, so we'll see how that goes."
"The Pope is in Mexico. On his way home, he was asked about Donald Trump - which is funny on its own, really - and the Pope said, 'A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not a Christian.' Which, of course, is nonsense. Donald Trump made it very clear that his favorite book is the Bible, so he's definitely a Christian."
"Last night Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and Ben Carson got a chance to make an impression on the South Carolina voters. The primary there is on Saturday. Anderson Cooper asked personal questions. ... He asked [Rubio] what kind of music he liked. He said he liked electronic dance music - EDM. Why do we need to know this? Are we electing a President or an Uber driver?"
"Rubio also said he's a big fan of '90s West Coast hip-hop, which I think probably means he liked the 'Fresh Prince of Bel Air' theme song."
"Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton revealed that her favorite type of music is whatever type of music you like."
"During the town hall, Ben Carson touted his experience as a surgeon. He said he's had to take more 2:00 am phone calls than anybody else in the race, which must be why he looks like he's falling asleep all the time."
"Shocking news tonight. I got to get straight to the big celebrity feud everyone is talking about:Donald Trump versus the Pope. ? As America's foremost Catholic, let me explain what happened. The Pope is in Mexico right now, where he was asked about Donald Trump's plan to build a border wall. And his Holiness said, quote, 'A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not of building bridges, is not Christian. This man is not Christian, if he has said things like that.' Then Trump is okay because he has not said things like that. He has said exactly that, okay."
"I want to try to broker a peace. Mr. Trump, Mr. Pope. Is it possible that you guys are fighting because you have so much in common? After all, you both think you're infallible. You both sit on golden thrones and you both wear very silly things on your heads."
"While visiting Mexico yesterday, Pope Francis stated that he did not think that Donald Trump is a true Christian because of Trump's belief on immigration. I know you're thinking, 'There goes the Pope's chances on being the next season of 'Celebrity Apprentice.'"
"Do you know how wrong you have to be for a Pope to dislike you? I mean, the Pope's entire thing is literally forgiveness. Pope John Paul hung out with the guy who tried to assassinate him, and now Pope Francis is like, 'I can't with this Trump guy. I can't.'"
"Trump fired back saying the Pope will wish Donald Trump were president if the Vatican is ever attacked. I have to say, the only time I think people will wish Trump was president is if Ted Cruz is president."
"In a historic move, [the Pope] also suggested that it might be acceptable to use contraception in order to prevent the spread of the Zika virus. And that's not surprising to me because once you start debating with Donald Trump, birth control starts to seem like a pretty good idea."
"When asked about Donald Trump, Pope Francis said that people who build walls are not Christians. And Donald said, 'Of course I'm a Christian. Do you know how many carpenters named Jesus I have working for me?'"
"Over on the Democratic side, Bernie Sanders is getting support of students at Hillary Clinton's alma mater, Wellesley College. ... So now Hillary Clinton is trying to get the support of Bernie's alma mater, Jurassic Park."
"During last night's Republican town hall, Ted Cruz confirmed that he sometimes calls his wife and sings to her, to which his wife always replies, 'Oh, no, I'm entering a tunnel.'"
"Ben Carson said during last night's town hall that he shoots pool to relax. Oh, he shoots pool. Because based on his energy level, I would have guessed heroin."
"Donald Trump responded to criticism from Pope Francis today and said the pontiff will wish Trump was president if - and when - the Vatican is attacked by ISIS. Though I think what he meant to say was, 'It's a nice Vatican you got there. Be a shame if something was to happen to it.'"
"Of course, tomorrow is the South Carolina primary, and this week Donald Trump has been telling supporters that if he wins South Carolina he thinks he could, quote, 'Run the table.' And if he doesn't win, he'll flip over the table like an angry New Jersey housewife."
"After doing poorly in Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina, Jeb Bush announced on Saturday night that he is dropping out of the race. Of course, that means Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz are both hoping to pick up Jeb's supporters. And Jeb was like, 'Joke's on you. I didn't have any supporters. Ah!'"
"After Jeb Bush dropped out, many sources are reporting that his super PAC spent about $100 million on the campaign. That's a lot of money. So we thought we'd break it down on how it was actually spent:$35 million was spent on staff members who could smile no matter what the polls said. $1,200 was spent on a golden retriever puppy meant to cheer up Jeb during the campaign. $65 million was spent on someone to cheer up that puppy after hanging out with Jeb. And that puppy was devastated. And then $2 was spent on a Powerball ticket so Jeb actually had a chance at winning something."
"The other big news is that Donald Trump won all 50 delegates in Saturday's South Carolina primary. So if you're paying attention, this is the official point when people go from saying, 'Oh, this was kind of fun' to 'Oh, my God. This is really happening.'"
"When asked about the possibility that Mexico might not agree to pay for his border wall, Donald Trump said, 'The wall just got ten feet higher.' People in Mexico were like, 'Okay, well, our tunnels are exactly the same. So, it doesn't matter.'"
"While Donald Trump was speaking at a rally in Atlanta, the lights suddenly went out and Trump said he actually liked it more in the dark. Then Melania Trump was like, 'Join the club.'"
"Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump won this weekend in Nevada and South Carolina, respectively, because Americans are ready for compassionate, principled, experienced leadership. Or the opposite."
"Jeb Bush has dropped out of the presidential race. When reached for comment, he said, 'Oh, now you want to talk to me? Great.'"
"According to a new report, Bernie Sanders has raised over $16 million from unemployed Americans. Wow. That was awfully nice of the Kardashians."
"Speaking of nauseating circumstances, the race for president is starting to get down to it. On Saturday, there was a Republican primary and Democratic caucuses. Hillary Clinton edged out Bernie Sanders in Nevada. She won by five points, thanks to a key last-minute endorsement from the Blue Man Group that took her over the top."
"Meanwhile, Jeb Bush is done. On Saturday night ,after finishing fourth in South Carolina, Jeb finally put himself out of his misery and dropped out of the race. Quite a reaction. One lady says, 'No, no!' It was probably his wife."
"When [Donald Trump] announced his intention to be president, it never occurred to me that his end game was to 'be' president. But it's time to end the denial. We as a nation must prepare for the very strong possibility of President Donald J. ... I think I just 'trumped' in my mouth a little."
"Actually, tonight the Republican candidates have their Nevada caucus, and caucus officials use their smartphones to report the results. Which is weird, 'cause usually officials get in trouble for using their phones to send pictures of their caucus."
"While campaigning in Nevada yesterday, Sen. Marco Rubio said he's anti-prostitution, and said he won't be visiting any brothels. Even weirder, he said that alone into a bathroom mirror."
"Ben Carson held a town hall event at a casino in Reno, and despite polling in last place, he said it's too early to give up. Even the old lady sitting at the slot machine said, 'This is just depressing.'"
"I saw that Ted Cruz's dad said that God sent a message to Ted Cruz's wife giving his permission to run for president. I'm not sure that's what God meant when he told Cruz's wife, 'Run.'"
"Yesterday a group of more than 20 unions released a statement supporting Hillary Clinton for president, including the Bricklayers Union. Then Donald Trump was like, 'Et tu, wall builders?'"
"President Obama today announced plans to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay. It's a pretty simple plan, really. He's going to put a RadioShack sign on it."
"We're now a week away from the Super Tuesday primaries, and Ben Carson is so excited he barely got 14 hours of sleep last night."
"At a rally in Las Vegas last night, Donald Trump told supporters he'd like to punch protesters in the face. Though he looks more like the kind of guy who would stroke a white cat while somebody else punched you in the face."
Hillary Clinton recently visited the set of the hit ABC show 'Scandal.' Is that really the show you should be visiting right now? Why not drop by the set of 'I did nothing wrong' or maybe 'There was nothing illegal in those emails?'
"It was a big day for Donald Trump. The Nevada caucuses took place. Voting in the state of Nevada is a little different. In Nevada, you pull the lever first and then you find out who you voted for. It is more exciting."
"Donald Trump was heavily favored to win [Nevada.] Not just by Donald Trump - by other people, too. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz are in a fierce battle for second place. Ted Cruz is very 'Trumpy' lately. He just released an ad. He promises to sell off or give away all of Nevada's public lands, national parks, forests and monuments - which is a great idea if you're a cult leader or the founder of a polygamist sect. If you're regular citizen, maybe not."
"He said on 'O'Reilly Factor,' if he is elected, he would not allow aliens to return. But Ted Cruz says, he is so strict on immigration. He says if he is elected president, he will even deport himself back to Canada."
"Tonight, they're holding the big Republican caucus in Nevada. And right now, the smart money is on money, because Donald Trump leads in the latest Nevada polls by 16 percent. He's drawing huge crowds there! He's like a one-man Cirque du Soleil, in that I can't figure out why either one is popular."
"Are you paying attention to the elections? How can you not? It's Donald Trump against all reasonable expectation. He's now the - no kidding around - favorite to become the Republican nominee for president. He won the Nevada caucuses last night. He didn't just win, he destroyed. He got more votes than Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz combined. It's huge. It's humongous. It's humiliatingly close to unanimous. Trump won in every demographic. He won white men, white women, white rich people, white poor people, rural whites, urban whites. He got one vote from a Chinese guy, which was nice."
"Trump actually even won the Latino vote, which is amazing. ? I have to say it makes me wonder if people really come here from Mexico for a better life or if they come to get away from their relatives? Maybe they want the wall to keep their in-laws out."
Dr. Ben Carson finished a very distant fourth in Nevada. He only got five percent of the vote. But for some reason he's still not dropping out. He's promised to continue on. He said - and this is a quote - 'I believe that things are starting to happen here.' Here's how you know it's time to drop out. You know it's time to go when it's been weeks since Donald Trump even bothered to call you a moron.
"Last night the GOP held their Nevada caucus, and the people of Vegas did what they do best - they pulled the lever and risked absolutely everything. And when it was over, it came up orange, orange, orange, because Donald Trump won a huge victory, taking every Las Vegas demographic:Elvis impersonators, white tiger handlers, even master illusionists."
"The point is, Donald Trump is now the likely Republican nominee, with a real shot at being the next president, and I'm not sure if I'm horrified or entertained. It's like watching one of those nature documentaries where the python unhinges its jaw and slowly swallows the capybara and then becomes president of the United States."
"But now, Trump winning all these primaries has caused the establishment Republicans to realize that Trump is winning all these primaries. ? Yes, like many other Las Vegas visitors, the GOP woke up this morning with a raging hangover, wondering what the [heck] happened last night."
"This billionaire having his way with the election is shocking and unthinkable to the billionaires who have their way with our elections. So they've formed an anti-Trump super PAC, which has already spent more than $3.5 million on negative ads - much of the cash coming from the family that owns the Chicago Cubs. And we all know the Cubs are synonymous with winning."
"Last night was the Republican caucus in Nevada. And Donald Trump scored a big victory, bringing him one step closer to the Republican nomination. ... The Trump presidency is getting very real right now. It's getting so real, Mexico is starting to think a wall is a pretty great idea."
"Donald Trump won his third state last night. In fact, he got more votes than Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz combined. It was so bad, afterwards, Rubio and Cruz stopped fighting and just started holding each other."
"Did you see this? Donald Trump said that if elected president, he'd look into prosecuting Hillary Clinton for using her private email server. So, if Trump wins, Hillary will already be on trial for murdering her entire campaign staff."
"Meanwhile, after finishing a distant second in Nevada, Marco Rubio apparently went to bed as the results were still coming in. When asked if he needed a wake-up call, he said, 'I think I just got one.'"

"Donald Trump said yesterday that his supporters are so loyal that they would kill for him. In fact, that's who killed that thing he wears on his head."
"Donald Trump's wife, Melania, said in a new interview that she speaks at least four languages. Melania said she's always looking for a new way to say, 'Help me!'"
"Donald Trump's wife, Melania, said in a new interview that her husband's amazing mind helped her fall for him. So it wasn't purely physical like we all assumed."
"After he won yesterday's Nevada caucus, Donald Trump said, 'I love the poorly-educated.' Trump then said, 'And when I'm president there will be more of them than ever.'"
"Donald Trump's wife is speaking out more. Although she herself is an immigrant, Donald Trump's wife, Melania, says she is fine with her husband's tough, anti-immigration stance. When asked why, Mrs. Trump said she had about 4.5 billion reasons."
"Wealthy GOP donors are now lining up behind Marco Rubio. Not because the donors think he can stop Trump, but because they think Rubio is the valet."
"Hillary Clinton came to Los Angeles, and she visited the set of the political drama 'Scandal'. It was an awkward moment when Hillary told the writers, 'Man, have I got some ideas for you.'"
"Despite Jeb Bush's poor campaign, some analysts are already talking about the political rise of his son, George P. Bush. ? George P. Bush has already got his campaign slogan, 'Don't worry, I was adopted.'"
"Donald Trump has a powerful new enemy and his name is Mitt Romney. You remember Mitt Romney, the JC Penney mannequin who came to life and ran for president four years ago? Well, he's back. He's got his Dockers sharply pressed, his sleeves rolled up perfectly, and he's raring to fight."
"Mitt Romney went on Fox News yesterday to say he believes there will be a bombshell in Donald Trump's tax returns once they are released. Romney said either he's not as rich as he says he is or he didn't give money to the veterans or disabled people like he's been saying he does. Well, yeah. I mean, he might be right, but how is that a bombshell? Of course he's not as rich as he says he is. He's not as anything as he says he is. He's Donald Trump."
"Meanwhile, if Donald Trump wants a win he needs to improve his relationship with Hispanic voters. Out of everyone running, Trump is the candidate most disliked by Hispanics. Apparently his plan to woo them with a giant wall mysteriously backfired."
"According to a new poll, eight in 10 Hispanic voters have an unfavorable view of Donald Trump. I really wonder who the two Hispanic voters who find him favorable. The only reason I can think of for a Latino to like Donald Trump is if they're thinking about going back to Mexico and don't want to pay for a moving truck."
"According to the 'Wall Street Journal', Donald Trump's campaign might be destroying marriages, which is shocking. Up till now, all Trump was destroying is the Republican Party. Apparently, Trump has been causing husbands and wives to argue until they're orange in the face. One couple disagrees so strongly that they've instituted a rule:When Trump comes on the TV, they switch to the National Geographic Channel. Because, when you're married, turning off the TV is not an option."
"Tonight in Houston, Texas, there was yet another Republican debate. Even the people on 'Grey's Anatomy' were like, 'How long does this go on?'"
Tonight was the tenth Republican debate. You can tell the candidates are getting bored up there because at one point they took turns prank calling Jeb Bush.
"Last night, John Kasich said his favorite President was George Washington because he could have been President forever but stepped down after two terms. While Trump said his favorite President was George Washington because he also wore a fantastic wig."
"In a new interview, Donald Trump's wife, Melania, said that she speaks English, Italian, French, and German, which is good because if she ever becomes First Lady she'll need to apologize for her husband in at least those four languages."
"The South Carolina democratic primary is Saturday and Hillary Clinton holds a double-digit lead over Bernie Sanders in the state. When asked how he'd go after southern voters, Bernie Sanders said, 'Please, call me Colonel Sanders.'"
"And Hillary Clinton appeared on the 'Steve Harvey Show' yesterday. And she said she prefers thin crust pizza to deep dish pizza. Yeah. When asked what her favorite toppings are, Hillary was like, 'I will release my favorite toppings when all the other candidates release their favorite toppings.'"
"CNN and Telemundo both carried tonight's debate, so questions were addressed either for Mr. Trump or para el diablo."
"Donald Trump said yesterday that if elected, he will work to repeal Obamacare on the first day of his presidency. But that's okay because healthcare is free where we're all going."
"Donald Trump said yesterday that his supporters are so loyal that they would kill for him. In fact, that's who killed that thing he wears on his head."
"Donald Trump today called former Republican nominee Mitt Romney a dope, to which Romney replied, 'Thanks, dude, you're pretty fresh yourself.'"
"President Obama posted on LinkedIn today about his first job scooping ice cream. He's the first President to post on LinkedIn, other than, of course, Abraham LinkedIn."
"John Kasich yesterday addressed Donald Trump's recent primary victories and said, 'It's not what the score is at the first quarter, it's what the score is at the end of the game.' Though neither one of those matter very much when you're in the marching band."
"Astronaut Scott Kelly is about to return to Earth after spending an entire year in space. ? Then he saw Donald Trump's poll numbers and he said, 'You know, I'm good up here.'"
"It's been reported that Donald Trump, despite his anti-immigration stance, hired over 500 foreign workers at his Florida resort. In fairness, the resort is called Hypocrisy Cove."
It's been announced that Vice President Joe Biden will be a presenter at Sunday night's Oscars. So diversity problem solved. That controversy is gone.
"Today, President Obama said that his very first job was scooping ice cream. After hearing this, Chris Christie said, 'I thought he looked familiar.'"
"Last night was the tenth Republican debate, which featured all five of the remaining candidates. They all had a lot of interesting things to say. At least I think they did. ... And during the debate, people noticed there was a woman that kept screaming in the audience. And then Hillary [Clinton] was like, 'I'm sorry, I just love how this is going.'"
"So the former President George H.W. Bush and his wife Barbara were in attendance for the debate. Or as Jeb put it, 'First debate I'm not in is the one you show up to?'"
"And, yeah, I wanna say congratulations to Leonardo DiCaprio, who won his first Oscar last night. Won his first Oscar last night, 22 years after he received his first nomination. He was like, 'Do you have any idea what it's like to wait that long for something?' And Hillary [Clinton] was like, 'Yes.'"
"Marco Rubio seems like he's trying to beat Donald Trump at his own game. He said at a rally on Saturday that Donald Trump has the worst spray tan in America. Which led to the first time Donald Trump ever said, 'You shouldn't judge people based on the color of their skin.'"
"Actually Trump fired back at Rubio and said that Rubio couldn't get elected as dog catcher in Florida. Yeah, then people in Florida were like, 'Well, when your state is crawling with alligators, you don't really need a dog catcher. Kind of just takes care of it on its own.'"
"Former KKK grand wizard David Duke says he supports Donald Trump for president, but does not endorse everything about him. You know it's bad when even the KKK is like, 'Let's be careful with this guy. Because we're not sure exactly.'"
"The long awaited primary event, Super Tuesday, is tomorrow. 'Yeah? Well, so is 'NCIS, yelled Jeb Bush."
"According to the new CNN national poll, Donald Trump has increased his lead among the Republican field and is now up to 49 percent support. But remember, it's a CNN poll, so 49 percent is also the margin of error."
Donald Trump recently said that backstage at the debates it looks like Marco Rubio applies his makeup with a trowel. Which is a surprising critique from a man who applies his makeup by standing outside the Cheetos factory and waiting for an explosion.
"Of course, those of you checking your calendar know tomorrow is Super Tuesday, which is 13 primaries. And it could decide the election. So for Republicans, tonight is sphincter-clenching Monday."
"But [Donald] Trump could have a problem. You see, this time it's not about something he said. It's about something he didn't say. ... When someone asks you, 'Will you disavow the Ku Klux Klan?' just say 'yes' and start high-fiving your future cabinet. I can understand why you would want to wait for the end of the sentence. If someone says will you disavow the Ku-- they could be about to say 'cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs' or 'koo koo kachoo' and you don't want to anger cereal lovers or Beatles fans. But once they say Ku Klux, you know what is coming next."
"Of course, today is Super Tuesday. This could be do or die for a lot of the candidates, including Ted Cruz, who could be knocked out of the race depending on how things went tonight. Cruz said that dropping out would allow him to spend more time with his family. Then his family said, 'We gotta get this guy some votes.'"
"With today being Super Tuesday, millions of Americans headed to the polls to support candidates in state primaries and caucuses. And on their way out they received a sticker that said, 'I voted.' This year there were actually a variety of stickers that were given out. Let me show you what I mean. This sticker said, 'I voted so I could be late for work....' And finally, 'I voted for Hillary [Clinton] because she was in the voting booth when I stepped inside smoking a cigar, saying, 'We can do this the easy way or the hard way.'"
"Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas spoke during oral arguments yesterday for the first time in over ten years. I guess his exact words were, 'Damn, that was some good weed.'"

"A new report has found that super PACs supporting Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz have spent over $7 million on ads trying to bring down Donald Trump, when they could have just spent $500 on a wind machine."
"This year, as you know, Super Tuesday, this year only, will be followed by Horrified Wednesday."
"There was voting today in 13 states with hundreds of delegates at stake. I think this was interesting. Jeb Bush spent his Super Tuesday - you know, he's not running now - he spent his Super Tuesday at home ironing and re-ironing his Tommy Bahama shirts."
Donald Trump has been defending himself after failing to immediately condemn an endorsement from former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke. Trump blamed his hesitation on a bad earpiece. Or maybe he said hairpiece. I'm not sure.
"According to a new CNN poll, both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders would beat [Trump] in a head-to-head match-up if it happened today. The poll has Hillary winning 52%-44% and Sanders winning 55%-43%. Although Trump still has a strong lead among registered voters who collect pocket knives."
"The State Department last night released the last batch of those emails from Hillary Clinton's private email server when she was secretary of state. About 3,900 emails were made public. ... Ten months and like 52,000 emails later, the only thing we end up learning from all these emails we looked at is that Hillary Clinton is much more boring than anyone who ever worked at Sony."
"As we speak, 13 states are holding their presidential primaries. So many delegates are awarded, it can change the course of an election. Anything can happen. Unless you've looked at the polls, in which case, one thing can happen."
"Now, we actually tape this before the polls close tonight, so I still don't know yet who won or who cares. But on the Democratic side, while Hillary looks poised for big victories tonight, Bernie Sanders has promised to stay in the race for all 50 states. Or 51, if you count the state of denial."
"But there could be a shake-up for the Democrats, because it is being widely reported that there is solid, photographic proof linking Hillary Clinton to a known terrorist organization. An editor at 'Politico' was tipped off that in Hillary Clinton's book 'Living History,' Hillary included this picture of her family in 1959 with their cat, ISIS!"
"That's right, Hillary Clinton's childhood cat was named ISIS. This is the most shocking political pet news since Jimmy Carter revealed his childhood cat's name was 'Ayatollah Katmeini.'"
"Now, 'Politico' isn't claiming that Hillary Clinton named her cat after ISIS. We have to leave open the possibility that ISIS named themselves after Hillary's cat. We just don't know yet. But it does make sense, if you don't think about it."
"And Super Tuesday is just as crucial for the Republicans, which is why things got so heated in the last Republican debate. ... It was like ultimate fighting but without the satisfaction of seeing any of them get kicked in the face. It got so bad, at one point - and this is true - CNN's closed captions for the debate just said 'unintelligible yelling.'"
"Now, the guy establishment Republicans are counting on to take [Donald] Trump down is Marco Rubio, who, unfortunately, is trailing in every Super Tuesday race and is behind Trump even in his home state of Florida by almost 20 points. He's losing all the key Florida demographics:The elderly, the furries, and guys in jean jackets who sell pool noodles out of a van."
"Donald Trump won Super Tuesday. Thirteen states and thousands of CNN graphics later, the votes have been counted, the delegates have been delegated, and the big winners were Donald Trump and Hillary Rodham Jefferson Clinton last night. Google reported today that the search phrase, 'How can I move to Canada' jumped 350 percent last night. That's not a joke. By the way, the answer is, you can't. He's going to build a wall up there, too. He's going to keep the Mexicans out and the rest of us in. That's the plan."
"Trump and Clinton, each won seven [states]. Bernie Sanders won four states. Ted Cruz won three. Ted Cruz won Alaska, Oklahoma, and his home state of Texas. I feel like the people in Texas might be voting for Ted Cruz just so they can get him to move to Washington."
"Dr. Ben Carson didn't win any states last night, but don't tell him. He slept through the whole thing."
"Carson released a statement today. He said he does not see a path forward to the presidency and he's going to skip the debate tomorrow night. Was he at the last one? If he does skip the debate tomorrow, how will we know? But even though he admitted he does not have a chance to win, he's not officially dropped out. He is still technically running for president, even though he said he has no chance to be - the guy can't even figure out how to not run for president."
"Now, on the Democratic side, the race is between front-runner Hillary Clinton and the senator from the great state of your liberal friends' Facebook feed, Bernie Sanders. Bernie won Vermont, Oklahoma, Minnesota, and Colorado. But Secretary Clinton had a massive sweep of everything else. Low turnout meant a rough night for Sanders. Evidently, a lot of people who were feeling the Bern got cooled down by some Preparation H."
"But the biggest winner of last night's losers was Ted Cruz, who managed to take home victories in Texas, Diet Texas [referring to Oklahoma], and Snow Texas [referring to Alaska]. That put Cruz ahead of Marco Rubio, his top rival in the race to be the final candidate to pass through Donald Trump's digestive tract."
"[Gov. John] Kasich still has a clear path to the presidency. Just take the White House tour, sneak into the oval office, lock the door and claim squatter's rights. It could work."
"Yesterday was Super Tuesday, which is the day where we find out a lot of things. But mostly we find out how many touch-screens CNN can fit in their studio."
"But it was a critical Super Tuesday for the Republican Party. Donald Trump won seven states, Ted Cruz won three states, and Marco Rubio won a highly coveted participation certificate, otherwise known as Minnesota."
"Of course, the seven states that Donald Trump won were Shock, Denial, Guilt, Anger, Bargaining, Depression and Alabama."
"But it seems incredible, but an analysis of Google shows that searches related to the phrase, 'How can I move to Canada' spiked last night about 350 percent. Truly, like typical. Americans always threaten to move to Canada when a reality show host endorsed by the KKK becomes the Republican nominee."
"Yesterday was Super Tuesday and it looks like it's gonna come down to Donald Trump versus Hillary Clinton for presidency. Even the alien and predator are like, 'This is too scary to watch.'"
"Hillary Clinton had a big night, picking up victories in seven states. While speaking in Miami last night, Hillary said, quote, 'I believe what we need in America today is more love and kindness.' Then she added, 'And I will crush anyone who won't let me do it.'"
"During her victory rally last night, one of the things Hillary said was that she wants to build a ladder of opportunity. Then people in Mexico said, 'Great, we'll use it to climb over the other guy's dumb wall.'"
"But it's not all good news for Hillary. Her last batch of her private server emails was released this week and in some of the emails, Clinton complains about some trouble with her fax machine. Hillary's exact words were, 'This piece of crap isn't shredding anything.'"
"Meanwhile, Bill Clinton was campaigning for Hillary at polling places in Boston and some said that he broke the rule that you can't campaign within 150 feet of people who are voting. Then Bill said, 'Trust me. There's a lot of people I'm not allowed to be within 150 feet of.'"
"But Bernie Sanders is still hanging in there. In fact, he wound up winning four states last night. And he said that he's looking forward to bringing Vermont values to the rest of the country. And Americans said, 'If you're talking weed and ice cream, I think we can settle this right now.'"
"Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton dominated their respective Super Tuesday primary races yesterday and each won seven states. So it's pretty much down to the two of them, which means America is about to make history or end history."
"Following his seven-state win in yesterday's Super Tuesday primary elections, Donald Trump said during his victory speech that he is a unifier. Then he turned to Chris Christie and said, 'Right, idiot?'"
"A top official in Saudi Arabia said today that a Trump presidency would, quote, 'Set the world back centuries.' The Saudi added, 'Which is why Trump has our full support.'"
"How about Marco Rubio last night? Rubio won his first state with a victory in the Minnesota primary. He finally won a state. Now, it was such a big night, Rubio's parents let him stay up and watch the returns."
"Dr. Ben Carson dropped out of the presidential race. After a dismal and ineffective campaign, he said, 'The good news is I'm ready to operate on your baby's brain again.'"
"During his speech on Super Tuesday, Bernie Sanders said, 'I am so proud to bring Vermont values all across this country.' That's what he said. Then Sanders said, 'Now, who wants to go antiquing?'"
"Yesterday, in Massachusetts, Bill Clinton may have violated the law by walking into a polling place and taking photos with voters. It's being called the lamest Bill Clinton scandal in history."
"Mitt Romney this morning made a televised speech, in which he went all-in after Donald Trump. He called him a phony and a fraud. He said he's playing the American public for suckers. I haven't seen Mitt this fired up since that time he dripped mayonnaise on a new pair of chambray Dockers."
"I love to imagine him making the decision to speak out. [Imitating Mitt Romney's wife] 'Mitt, don't do this.' [Imitating Mitt Romney] 'I'm sorry, Ann, but someone has to step up and save this nation.' It's like watching your dad march out to the black top to have a talk with the schoolyard bully. No good could possibly come out of it."
"If Mitt Romney is the big gun the Republicans sent in to stop Trump, they're in a lot of trouble. It's like sending a meter maid in to break up a prison riot."
"Meanwhile, Donald Trump is trying his hardest to be more presidential lately. He even started to offer specifics about stuff. He released his healthcare plan yesterday and actually it's pretty good. You have a protein shake for breakfast and another one for lunch and sensible dinner and it works."
"The plan claims it will reduce the number of individuals needing access to programs like Medicaid, which I'm sure it will. If Trump becomes president, it will reduce the number of individuals living in the United States."
"[Astronaut] Scott Kelly may have missed a lot of the presidential race so far, but there is plenty more for him to catch up on, because in the next few weeks, five more states will weigh in on the presidential election:Michigan, Ohio, Louisiana, Nebraska, and Florida. In Florida, they will cast their votes the traditional way - by voting for whoever looks more like their grandson."
"Donald Trump's big win on Super Tuesday has made it clear that he is the likely nominee of the Republican Party and that has sent the Republican establishment into a deep, deep panic. They do not want to be with this guy, but the voters are choosing this. It's like an arranged marriage and, unlike Trump's other marriages, this one could last eight years."
"For instance, if Trump is the nominee, Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vows that his colleagues will, quote, 'Drop him like a hot rock,' which is a huge sacrifice for someone who is part tortoise."
"I know there's an angry Republican base out there, but this guy [referring to Mitt Romney] says it [not voting for Donald Trump] is the only way to save democracy from the voters. After you vote, maybe you will get a sticker that says, 'I did what Mitt Romney told me to.'"
"This game of ganging up against the popular guy who's winning, that's not democracy. That's a reality show strategy and that is Trump's home turf. You honestly think you are going to be better at this than him? It's like saying, 'You know, the way to fix our great white shark problem is get in the water with him. But first let me put on my lucky ham.'"
"Mitt Romney gave a big speech against Donald Trump today and said, quote, 'A business genius he is not.' Then Romney was like, 'Yoda, my speechwriter is.'"
"Romney also said Trump's promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University. Then Trump said, 'Or as worthless as a Romney 2012 poster.'"
"During his speech, Mitt Romney also said Donald Trump is playing the American public for a free ride to the White House and, quote, 'All we get is a lousy hat.' Not to mention a $30 picture of how scared we all look on the way down."
"The Google search 'How to move to Canada' started trending after Donald Trump's impressive showing on Super Tuesday. Or as Canadians put it, 'Great, now we need to build a wall.'"
"Former nominee Mitt Romney gave a speech today to try to stop Donald Trump from securing the Republican nomination. And in a related story, a Japanese soldier fired his rifle at Godzilla. That's not enough to stop him."
"Mitt Romney gave a speech at the University of Utah this morning, critical of Donald Trump. And in it, he said Trump's promises are as worthless as the degree from Trump University. Then Romney dropped the mic and it broke his toe."
"After Super Tuesday the other day, it looks like we're finally moving toward the general election. It's being reported that the Democrats have a plan to shatter the Republican Party. When he heard this, Donald Trump said, 'Beat you to it.'"
"Ted Cruz is trying really hard trying to tie Donald Trump to a prominent mobster. In an attempt to repair the damage to his reputation, the mobster is distancing himself from Trump."
"The Republican candidates had their 11th debate [on Thursday] night. ... And as you would expect, Hillary Clinton came up a lot during the debate. At one point, Ted Cruz even asked Trump why he wrote four checks to Hillary for her campaign in 2008. Trump said, 'Look, with all the women I have to write checks to every month, it's easy to get carried away.'"
"Meanwhile, Marco Rubio called out Donald Trump for his clothing collection that is being made in China. But Trump defended his Chinese workers, saying, 'I treat those kids like they're my own.'"
"[Gov. John Kasich] got a high-profile endorsement from Arnold Schwarzenegger. Arnold officially endorsed John Kasich yesterday. Or maybe he endorsed a chicken quesadilla, I have no idea. I really don't know what he's saying."
"Basically Gov. Kasich is hoping to beat the former host of 'The Apprentice,' with help from the current host of 'The Apprentice,' Arnold Schwarzenegger."
"This morning I turn on CNN to find out they're calling tomorrow Super Tuesday Two. There can't be a Super Tuesday Two. Tuesday two already has a name, it's Wednesday."
"From the popular Donald Trump reality show, Mitt Romney is here with us tonight. You know in the movies when the monster's rampaging through the city and all hope seems to be lost, and then the government tracks down a scientist who swore he would never come out of retirement and asks him to save us? That's why Mitt Romney is here tonight. To destroy the Donald on National Pancake Day."
"Today is what CNN is calling Super Tuesday Two. There were primaries and caucuses in four states today:Michigan, Hawaii, Idaho and Mississippi. Donald Trump was in Mississippi yesterday. And I don't know if he was confused. Maybe he's forgetting where he is now. He's been in so many places. But weirdly, he took time out of his speech in Mississippi to talk about the potatoes in Idaho."
"[Referring to the various presidential candidates' campaign stores] Dr. Ben Carson had some fun items for sale. ... Like this - the Ben Carson scrub top, complete with a name tag that says Ben Carson, pediatric neurosurgeon. It isn't so much a great way to support Ben Carson as it is a way to impersonate Ben Carson. It's a way to do illegal surgery under an assumed name."
"Surprisingly, Donald Trump's shop is slightly more subdued than the other candidates. Other than the fact that he's offering 17 different kinds of 'Make America Great Again' hats. He's also selling baby onesies. Because you know, babies scream all day, also. So that's a perfect gift for them."
"[Referring to Donald Trump's Tuesday appearance at a press conference in Florida] Trump was upset that Mitt Romney said a bunch of his business ventures failed, so he set these tables up on stage to showcase some of his many products. There's the water and the wine and the meat. Is this Fox News or QVC?"
"Yeah, they're up on the stage next to him as he spoke. It's like he made a trip to Costco right before the speech. Boy, did Chris Christie pick the wrong night to be on that stage, huh?"
"President Obama just had a physical, and we found out this morning from White House doctors - this is absolutely true - in the past two years, President Obama has grown half an inch. He's 54 years old. That is very late for puberty to kick in. I'm not sure if that's a change I can actually believe in. ? Is Obama trying to make himself look bigger to intimidate Congress, like how a lizard puffs out its neck frill? Or maybe he's just fudging his height so he can ride the White House roller coaster."
"Every two years, the President gets a physical. I guess the Vice President asks for it to make sure the President is still alive."
"Speaking of great strides for women, Hillary Clinton [on Wednesday] continued on her mission to become the first female president of the United States. She debated Bernie Sanders...in Miami. They talked about a number of subjects, including immigration reform, healthcare, Wall Street bailouts. But what got most people's attention, weirdly, was this. It was the color of Bernie Sanders' suit. Now online, people said it looked brown. Some people said it looked blue. A few lunatics said eggplant-colored. Even his spokesperson, at first, said it was blue, then corrected himself, saying it was black. When, clearly, the suit is brown. I mean, that suit is so brown, Donald Trump wants to have it deported."
"Here's the thing, I wish we could stop?focusing on things like the color of Bernie Sanders' suit and start focusing on the fact that he was able to successfully dress himself."
"The Republicans, tonight, had their own debate in Miami. There have been more Republican debates than seasons of 'Dancing with the Stars.'"
"[Wednesday] night was the eighth Democratic debate, in Florida. At this point, Bernie and Hillary really seem like just another old couple traveling the country, arguing about money."
"Donald Trump under fire again for his business practices. Despite Donald Trump's tough stance on immigration, Trump Modeling Agency is being accused of hiring lower-paid foreign models. In his defense, Trump says those aren't laborers - those are future wives."
A reporter claims she was pushed down by one of Donald Trump's campaign advisers. Isn't that crazy? Donald Trump has a campaign adviser.
"I'm your host, Jimmy Fallon, and I want to warn everyone to not get too rowdy, or Donald Trump might cancel the show."
"At a rally over the weekend, Donald Trump was surrounded by Secret Service agents after a man tried to rush the stage. The Secret Service said the man was dangerous and disturbed, but they had to protect him anyway."
"Trump was surrounded by Secret Service agents after a man tried to rush the stage, proving once and for all that the best way to keep everyone sound and safe is to build a wall around Donald Trump."
"Chris Christie interviewed Donald Trump today at a rally in North Carolina. Well, it was either a rally or in the waiting room of the world's most patriotic dentist."
"Hillary Clinton reminded attendees at last night's Democratic forum that she's received more votes than anybody else so far in the primary process. At which point the moderator said, 'Mrs. Clinton, I haven't finished introducing you yet.'"
"When endorsing Donald Trump for president last week, Dr. Ben Carson said that 'there are two different Trumps.' I don't know, Ben, that might just be a side effect of the Nyquil."
"Following reports that Bernie Sanders supporters were responsible for the disturbances that caused the Donald Trump rally to be called off, Trump has started threatening to send his own supporters to Sanders' events. Though if you don't want to be compared to Hitler, maybe don't send your followers after the Jewish guy."
"Marco Rubio was interrupted by a heckler at a Florida campaign rally yesterday, who accused Rubio of stealing his girlfriend. When in reality, Rubio tried to steal his girlfriend, but finished fourth."
The latest polls show Gov. John Kasich holds a small lead over Donald Trump in his home state of Ohio. Whereas everything Donald Trump holds looks huge because of his tiny baby hands.
"Tomorrow there are primaries in five states, and today, Mitt Romney hit the campaign trail with Gov. John Kasich, who's hoping to beat Donald Trump in his home state, Ohio. Romney stumping for Kasich in Ohio and Rubio in Florida, with the idea that he will stop Donald Trump. He's also got Holy Cross and Iona going into the finals in his NCAA bracket."
"Marco Rubio, who's still in the race, is encouraging people to vote for John Kasich in Ohio instead of him. Rubio says Kasich is the only one who can stop Trump in Ohio, and he's the only one who can stop Trump in Florida. Ted Cruz stopped Trump in Texas. Then the plan is, if they get to the convention, they're going to have Dr. Ben Carson sew all their bodies together to form one enormous super-candidate who just might have enough delegates to win."
"Speaking of things that make you feel sick - Donald Trump. Up 'til now, he's been the funny guy with the weird hair, and we've all had our fun poking at the big orange Garfield who hates Mexicans instead of Mondays. But recently, Trump's rallies have gotten ugly."
"First, in North Carolina, a Trump supporter sucker-punched a non-violent protester. On Friday, there were so many angry protesters at Trump's rally in Chicago that he canceled it. Which is strange. Usually a mob of angry people is a Trump rally."
"And on Saturday, during Trump's rally in Dayton, Ohio, a protester tried to rush the stage. He was either trying to disrupt the rally or just saw Trump's head from a distance and thought they were giving out free ham. The protester has been charged with disorderly conduct and inducing panic, which means he could be the next Republican frontrunner."
"I saw that Hillary Clinton is going to appear in this week's episode of the comedy show 'Broad City.' Meanwhile, Bernie Sanders will actually be appraised on 'Antiques Road Show.'"
A lot of people voted today in primaries across five states. Some people are even calling it Super Tuesday III. Marco Rubio is just calling it 'Mission:Impossible III.'
"A new poll found that the majority of millennials would vote Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump. Then millennials found out you can't vote by texting and said, 'Oh, never mind.'"
"I heard that a Donald Trump rally was delayed for nearly two hours yesterday due to fog. At one point the fog was so thick, Trump supporters couldn't even see who they were punching."
"New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio recently weighed in on Trump's campaign, calling Donald Trump a racist, and said that he participates in the worst kind of racism because he's just using it to get ahead. Raising the question, whats the best type of racism?"
"In an interview yesterday, Bernie Sanders admitted that he ran as Democrat rather than an independent to get more media coverage and it worked. But if you really want to get some coverage, try running as a fascist. [A picture of Donald Trump was shown.]"
"In a new interview, former Republican hopeful Mike Huckabee said that Donald Trump is Hillary Clinton's worst nightmare, which is ridiculous. Hillary Clinton's worst nightmare has already been president for seven years."
"In a new profile, Donald Trump's butler has revealed Trump coordinated his hats based on his mood, with a white hat signifying a good mood, and a red hat meaning Trump is angry or upset. Huh, so I wonder what orange hat means?"
"According to a new report, Dr. Carson hadn't planned to endorse any of the candidates, but after being offered a position in Trump's White House, he changed his mind. He would run the Department of No Energy."
"Donald Trump has been claiming correctly, I think, that his candidacy is fueling more interest in voting. More people are signing up to vote. Just like herpes fuels more interest in Valtrex, for instance."
"Hillary Clinton beat Bernie Sanders in Florida. And I'll say, that's tough for Bernie because if a 74-year-old Jewish man can't win in Florida..."
"Donald Trump got a much better endorsement when he got the backing of former Republican candidate [Ben Carson]. Did I say much better? I mean slightly better. It wasn't the most ringing endorsement. ... So wait a second, if Carson supports Trump, why haven't I seen him at any rallies? Oh, that's right, he doesn't like getting punched in the face."
"Trump won four of the five primaries last night, and - assuming she officially wins Missouri - Hillary Clinton went five-for-five in the primaries. A very disappointing night for Bernie Sanders, which was a little bit of a surprise. He seemed to be polling very well among everyone's most annoying Facebook friends."
"The bad news for the leaders of both parties:both Clinton and Trump have a very high unfavorability ratings. Hillary is 53 percent unfavorable and Trump clocks in at an extraordinary 63 percent unfavorable, which I think, like, Jared from Subway has higher than that. This election is going to be the political equivalent of having lunch at Panda Express - nobody wins."
"A disappointing finish for Marco Rubio, who had fueled his campaign with all the fire and spontaneity of Vicki the robot from 'Small Wonder.'"
Rubio dropped out of the race. He went back to Washington and locked his office door to make sure no Supreme Court nominees get in. So good luck to him.
"To secure the nomination at the convention in Cleveland this summer, Kasich would have to get 116 percent of the remaining delegates. We'd have to make him governor of every remaining state, plus some states we don't even have yet."
"And if Ted Cruz is right, if every single anti-Trump voter unites behind him, he could get enough delegates to be the nominee. Then the GOP establishment can say, 'Goodbye, candidate we don't like. Hello, candidate we can't stand.'"
"But if Cruz can't do it, there is one other way to deny Trump the nomination:a brokered convention. You see, when a candidate wins a primary, he wins delegates who are committed to him at the party convention, but only for the first ballot. So if Donald Trump doesn't get 1,237 delegates in the first round of voting, they're all free to vote for whoever. Great news. The Republican campaign could start all over again, only this time crammed into a week. So you can binge-watch the death of the GOP."
"Of course, last night we had a lot of presidential primaries and it was a huge night for Hillary Clinton, who won in five states. And afterwards she gave a speech and graciously thanked Bernie Sanders for the vigorous campaign he's waging, then said 'and losing.'"
"Meanwhile, during Bernie Sanders' speech after the losses, Bernie spoke up against the family that owns Walmart for paying low wages, which could backfire in a couple weeks when Bernie winds up working as a greeter."
"Donald Trump won every Republican state primary last night except for Ohio, which went to John Kasich. Trump didn't seem to mind since he said, as he put it, 'The word Ohio is full of zeros.'"
"The other big story from last night was that Marco Rubio pulled out of the race after losing the Florida primary to Trump by almost 20 points. But it still is a great story. I mean, nothing symbolizes America more than the son of poor immigrants growing up to run for president and then being crushed by a billionaire."
"President Obama nominated appeals court Judge Merrick Garland to serve on the Supreme Court. Judge Garland actually got choked up while accepting President Obama's nomination in the White House Rose Garden, especially when Obama was like, 'Will you accept this rose?'"
"Donald Trump won yesterday's Republican primaries in Florida, Illinois and North Carolina. Trump did especially well with white males, Caucasian men, and non-women of no color."
"According to exit-poll data, two thirds of Republican voters in yesterday's Florida primary were older than 50, and the other one-third were their parents."
"After finishing a distant second in his home state of Florida, Marco Rubio announced yesterday that he is ending his campaign. Rubio plans to return to his old job as a Lego businessman."
"When announcing last night that he is dropping out, Marco Rubio told supporters, 'We should have seen this coming.' If it makes you feel any better, Marco, we did."
"Hillary Clinton won yesterday's primaries in Florida, Illinois, North Carolina, and Ohio. And you can tell she's feeling confident, because she gave her victory speech from the Oval Office."
"President Obama announced today that he is nominating Washington, DC, Circuit Court Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court. 'I can't win anything this week,' screamed Jojo from 'The Bachelor.'"
"Well, you guys, how about the election, huh? It keeps getting weirder. Looks like the GOP is headed toward a brokered convention, where the party bosses pick somebody other than Trump or Cruz. But who could it be? Jeb Bush's name has been mentioned, followed by loud sobbing and the words, 'Leave me alone' coming from the vicinity of Florida."
"And there is an experienced party elder that everyone respects. It's John Boehner, who thinks we should make Paul Ryan do it. In fact, yesterday Boehner said, 'We don't have a nominee who can win a first ballot. I'm for none of the above. I'm for Paul Ryan to be our nominee.' Oh, John Boehner. Paul Ryan already got out of one sticky situation by agreeing to succeed you as Speaker of the House, when no one else wanted the job. Paul Ryan is your go-to flunky for everything."
"The hacking group Anonymous has apparently declared war against Donald Trump. Of course, hacking him shouldn't be hard, because if there's anyone who just uses their name as their password, it's Donald Trump."
"Ted Cruz was just featured in US Weekly's '25 Things You Didn't Know about Me' column. ... And on the list, he revealed he was once bitten by an octopus at the beach and got terribly ill. Then the octopus said, 'Yeah, it took me a while to recover, too.'"
"Yesterday, John Kasich - fresh off his win in the Ohio primary - said that if you can't win Ohio, you can't be president. Then George Washington said, 'What the [heck] is Ohio?'"
"President Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court - I read that some people are criticizing Obama for nominating a white, moderate man from Harvard to the Supreme Court, saying it lacks diversity. Then the President said, 'I'll try to do more to promote diversity or my name isn't the first black President of the United States!'"
"I saw that Trump Tower in Chicago was struck by lightning during the Illinois primary, which Donald Trump went on to win. ... Nobody was hurt, while God was like, 'Crap, I missed.'"
"Speaking of Trump, he recently said that if he becomes president, he'll force Apple to start making its products in the United States. It's great news for anyone who wants to pay $20,000 for an iPhone."
"Sen. Lindsey Graham has announced that he's supporting Ted Cruz since Jeb Bush is out of the race. And Graham had a lot of good things to say about Cruz, kind of. It explains Ted Cruz's new slogan, 'Ted Cruz, all you got left.'"
"Of course, the big story is President Obama's historic visit to Cuba that's going on right now. I saw that after landing yesterday, Obama immediately tweeted out, 'What's up, Cuba?' And Cubans opened up a window and yelled, 'We don't have the Internet! It's like 1955 here!'"
Donald Trump tweeted that Raul Castro disrespected the President by not greeting him at the airport. Seriously? Our countries have been enemies for 60 years. I can't even get my best friend to pick me up at the airport.
"Mitt Romney announced on Facebook that he will vote for Ted Cruz over Donald Trump in tomorrow's Utah caucus because he doesn't believe John Kasich can actually win. And if there's one thing Romney's an expert on, it's not winning."
"A lot of people actually think John Kasich would make a good pick for vice president. But Kasich said in an interview yesterday that he will not be vice president under any circumstances. When he heard that, Joe Biden was like, 'Seriously? I did it for a $20 gift card to GameStop.'"
"A new study shows Donald Trump speaks with the poorest grammar of any presidential candidate. Trump says, 'It's actually the poorliest.'"
"Donald Trump announced over the weekend that he will release a list of judges that he would consider appointing to the Supreme Court if he's elected president. Though, you can get a sneak peek at the list by checking out TV Guide."
"Democratic National Committee head Debbie Wasserman Schultz today denied accusations that she is taking sides in the primary election season, and said, quote, 'There is no shred of evidence to suggest I'm favoring Hillary Clinton over Bernie Socialist, I mean Bernie Sanders, my apologies.'"
"Bernie Sanders this weekend gave a speech at the Mexican border. Actually, he was in Vermont, but they could hear him at the Mexican border."
"Bernie Sanders' campaign has confirmed that he will not speak at a major pro-Israel lobbying group conference this week, making him the only presidential candidate to skip it. And if any candidate can get away with that, it's Bernie from Brooklyn. Look at him. If Israel were a person, that's what it would look like."
"The latest on President Obama's trip to Cuba. I saw that over the weekend he and his family were photographed on a walking tour of Havana in the pouring rain. Which means the President's like everyone's dad on vacation. If he paid for the nonrefundable tour, you're going to go on that nonrefundable tour."
Obama also spoke from Cuba yesterday and said that US airlines will start making commercial flights to Cuba this year. But first Obama said he wants to see a greater respect for human rights. Not in Cuba. At LaGuardia.
"In an interview with CNN last night, Ted Cruz was asked about being Donald Trump's vice president and said, quote, 'I have zero interest whatsoever.' Which is also what Cruz's friends say when he invites them to dinner."
"Bernie Sanders recently spoke at a US-Mexico border in Arizona and said, quote, 'We don't need a wall.' Then Bernie said, 'But then again, I told Noah we didn't need an ark, so who knows?'"
"Bernie Sanders has ignited a lot of passion, primarily among young people. And the incredible thing is he did it without posting even a single nude selfie. Bernie can get very fired up. I watch him on these debates. But remember, if it seems like he's yelling at you, it's because he is yelling at you and you deserve it."
"Bernie was on the ballot in three states today. There was a primary in Arizona and caucuses in Idaho and Utah. Donald Trump was behind in the polls in Utah. Utah is not particularly friendly territory for Donald Trump, because most of the voters there are sober."
"But according to a new poll, 60 percent of Republicans say they're embarrassed by their candidates in the primary so far. That means almost 40 percent of Republicans aren't embarrassed by their candidates in the primary so far. How can that be? When he's asked why he thinks so many of his fellow Republicans are embarrassed, Donald Trump said, 'What's embarrassed? What is it?'"
"There were primaries and caucuses?in three states [on Tuesday]. Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton won the big one, Arizona. Ted Cruz won Utah. Bernie Sanders won Idaho and Utah. It's like tee-ball. Everybody won something, except John Kasich. He didn't win anything."
"At this point, it's mathematically impossible for John Kasich to win the nomination, but he's still running. ... It would be like if Michigan State refused to drop out of the NCAA basketball tournament after they lost last week."
Donald Trump did well in Arizona largely because of his promise to fill the Grand Canyon with illegal immigrants and then have Superman pick them up and fly them all back over the border.
Voter turnout was very high in Idaho and Utah. There were lines around the block. It's rare to see so many white people waiting in line for something that isn't a new Apple product or 'Star Wars' movie.
"Bernie Sanders was expected to win Idaho, and he did win. He's popular there. He's popular because he kind of looks like a potato if you hit him in the right light."
"Donald Trump finished third in Utah and got very upset when he saw an ad that targeted Mormon voters. This is the ad they used - an old photo from 'GQ' magazine from his wife, shot before they were married. The ad was the work of a super PAC called 'Make America Awesome.' It's a real thing. Trump put the problem on Ted Cruz. He tweeted, 'Wow, Senator Ted Cruz that is some low-level ad you did using a picture of Melania in a GQ shoot. Be careful or I will spill the beans on your wife.' And then he quickly deleted that tweet and replaced it with this. 'Lying Ted Cruz used a picture of Melania from a GQ shoot in his ad. Be careful, Lyin' Ted, or I will spill the beans on your wife.' Only Donald Trump would delete a threatening tweet then replace it with a slightly more threatening tweet."
"By the way, how do you spill the beans on Heidi Cruz? Look at her. This woman hasn't spilled a bean in her life, and if she did, she'd mop it up with an anti-bacterial wet wipe."
"Yesterday was another primary election day, and because Tuesday is the most convenient day of the week to take three hours out of your life, the people of Arizona chose to do just that. Yeah, only person sadder than the ones who had to wait in line for three hours is John Kasich, who got fewer votes than Marco Rubio, a man who isn't even in the race anymore."
"I read that Utah registered almost 60,000 people to vote in the Republican caucus online. The Republican caucus online. You know, the candidates aren't very popular when people only vote if they can do it in their underwear."
"Donald Trump said yesterday that a lot politicians who say they are against him in public are secretly supporting his campaign, or as Hillary Clinton put it, 'Guilty.'"
"An editor for 'The Washington Post' says that Donald Trump actually hit on her after she asked him a question. To be fair, the question was, 'What do you consider torture?'"
In some recent interviews...Hillary Clinton's older supporters said they were drawn to her because of her experience and foreign policy background. While Bernie Sanders' oldest supporters are drawn to because he makes them feel young.
I saw that Sarah Palin just signed a deal to act as a judge on a new reality court TV show. Sarah said she just wants to get a little legal experience before Trump nominates her to the Supreme Court.
"Donald Trump won yesterday's Arizona Republican primary with almost 50 percent of the vote. He narrowly beat the second place finisher, a gun wearing a cowboy hat."
"Some of the voters in yesterday's Arizona primary spent two hours in line before reaching the polls, which is significant because most voters in Arizona don't have that many hours left."
"Yesterday, Donald Trump threatened to reveal a terrible secret about Ted Cruz's wife. ... Apparently Trump has some damning video of her marrying Ted Cruz."
"At the Arizona primary, Republican voters had to wait as long as five hours to vote. Five-hour wait. People in Arizona were furious and said, 'That's time I could have spent deporting my gardener.'"
"Bernie Sanders was here on Tuesday and Secretary Clinton is here tonight. They're an interesting pair because they're still competing with each other, but eventually we know they're going to team up to stop the deranged billionaire who wants to take over the world, which, if you think about it, is basically the plot to 'Batman v. Superman,' the movie."
"If it comes down to Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, if the vote was today, Donald Trump would be in trouble. According to a new Bloomberg poll, Clinton leads Trump in a hypothetical matchup 54%-36%. And this is interesting, 68% of likely general election voters, according to this poll, view Donald Trump negatively. And the other 32% don't have Twitter or television."
"[Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz] were feuding this week after an attack ad featured a nude photo of Trump's wife, Melania. And Trump threatened to retaliate against Ted Cruz's wife, Heidi. And while Trump and Cruz were arguing, Melania and Heidi quietly escaped."
Donald Trump is furious over an ad featuring a nude photo of Melania Trump. Trump's mostly furious because it's the first time he's seen Melania naked in years.
"I read that the State Department is having to hire more staffers to review all of the requests that are being filed for Hillary Clinton's emails. Or as Hillary put it, 'See, I'm creating jobs already.'"
But here's some good news for Hillary Clinton. Yesterday she received the endorsement of 'Rolling Stone' magazine. While Bernie Sanders received the endorsement of 'Kidney Stone Magazine.'
"Hillary also targeted Donald Trump's recent comments on foreign policy, saying if Trump gets his way, it will be like Christmas for Russia. Then Russians were like, 'So, we all get potato in sock?'"
"Hillary Clinton said that if Donald Trump becomes president, it will be like Christmas in the Kremlin. Christmas in the Kremlin, which actually sounds like an amazing holiday movie starring Vladimir Putin."
"Two women were arrested at a Bernie Sanders rally in LA yesterday for removing their tops and revealing the words, 'Feel the Bern,' written on their naked bodies. So even if Bernie doesn't beat Hillary, he could still end up getting picked to replace Zayn [Malik from the group One Direction]."
People on Wall Street are worried about the negative effects of a Donald Trump presidency. Also worried:people on every street.
"Dr. Ben Carson appeared on 'The View' this morning. And when asked afterwards what he thought of 'The View,' he said, 'Blurry.'"
"A new poll shows that 55% of voters say Hillary Clinton is more presidential than Donald Trump. I think in terms of who's most presidential it goes by this - Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, John Kasich, everybody else in the world, Donald Trump, and Turtle from 'Entourage.'"
"Last night, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani said Hillary Clinton could be considered a founding member of ISIS. That's ridiculous - ISIS doesn't hire women."
"During voting on Tuesday, Bernie Sanders tweeted a list of hotlines for his supporters to call if they had questions or issues while voting. While, if Bernie needs help, he just presses his Life Alert button."
"I read about a parrot that actually hangs out at Bernie Sanders' campaign office in Tennessee. So if you want to hear someone repeat everything that Bernie Sanders says, just wait two weeks for Hillary to say it."
"Actually, there's some good news for Hillary. I read that George Clooney emailed Hillary Clinton supporters a letter endorsing her for president. Or as Hillary put it, 'That's one email I'll never delete.'"
"Today, President Obama hosted the annual Easter Egg Roll at the White House. And I saw that the theme was 'Let's Celebrate.' Obama came up with the theme 'Let's celebrate' when he realized it was the last year he would ever have to do this."
"Well here's some good news for Donald Trump. Yesterday, he welcomed his eighth grandchild. It was so sweet. When Donald met him, he was like, 'Welcome to the Elite Eight.'"
"That's right, Donald Trump became a grandfather again yesterday. However, Trump says he won't visit his new grandson until he learns to speak English."
"I saw that while covering the Democratic caucuses Saturday, CNN had a caucus-cam set up. It's a camera that shows pics of your caucus. Or as most people call that, 'Snapchat.'"
"The President and first lady today hosted the annual White House Easter Egg Roll. It's a tradition that's been going on for 138 years. Since the year Bernie Sanders was born, this has been happening."
"Donald Trump got a nice delivery on Sunday:a new grandson. His daughter, Ivanka, gave birth to a baby boy. She named him Theodore, which is interesting. Theodore is usually shortened to Ted, like Ted Cruz. That's one way to get back at your father, I guess."
"As of a couple of hours ago, Donald Trump hasn't tweeted about his new grandson. He's waiting to see the birth certificate. He's nothing if not fair."
"Bernie Sanders had a happy Easter weekend. He swept all three Democratic contests in Washington, Alaska, and Hawaii. And he had Syracuse in the Final Four, so he got them all."
"Sanders now trails Hillary Clinton in delegate count by slightly-less-insurmountable margins. For him to win the nomination, he's going to need to win big in New York, California, and Pennsylvania. And three other states that don't currently exist yet."
"You know who else had a great week? Bernie Sanders. Saturday, he won three caucuses:Washington, Alaska, and Hawaii, where voters said, 'Aloha' to Bernie Sanders. And to Hillary Clinton, they said, 'Aloha.'"
"That's an exciting three-state sweep for Senator Sanders. What was that magic that put him over the top? I'd say it was this moment on Friday. Yes, a bird landed on Bernie Sanders' podium. What are the odds that a bird would be attracted to an old man who looks like he has bread in his pockets?"
"Did you know that Trump also became a grandfather for the eighth time, ladies and gentlemen? Ivanka Trump gave birth to Donald Trump's new grandson yesterday. What's interesting is that the baby actually shares a name with Trump's worst enemy. No, she hasn't called the baby Mexicans. The baby is called Ted, like Ted Cruz. And when Donald Trump actually met the baby, he was like, 'Wow, look at the size of those hands.'"
"Meanwhile, on the Democratic side, Bernie Sanders has been on a hot streak. He won three states on Saturday, but the biggest thing that happened to him was at a rally in Portland, Oregon, where he got a surprise visit from an unexpected guest. That bird landing on his podium was actually the closest Bernie Sanders has come to ever sending a tweet. I'm not mocking Bernie, but when a bird lands on your podium, and that's the biggest reaction you get, maybe you're not the most interesting presidential candidate."
"It's now the second week of spring, but New York City was under a high wind advisory all day, with wind gusts up to 50 miles per hour. Most New Yorkers went about their daily routines, while Donald Trump went into his panic room."
"The weather here in New York was sunny, but chilly. Or as meteorologists call it, 'The Hillary Clinton.'"
"Fidel Castro wrote a letter addressing President Obama's historic trip to Cuba and said that Cuba doesn't want any presents from the US. Which, as any husband will tell you, means they definitely want presents."
"Donald Trump, in an interview, supported the idea of holding back attacks on the wives and children of rival candidates, before adding, 'All you have to do that is tell that to Cruz because he started it.' Trump then added, 'I'm not touching him, I'm not touching him, I'm not touching him.'"
"A former consultant to the Donald Trump campaign recently claimed that Trump did not initially plan to actually win the Republican nomination. Even more shocking, Jeb Bush did."
"Following President Obama's historic visit, the Rolling Stones this weekend played a free concert in Cuba, finally giving Cubans the chance to see something older than their cars."
"Conservative pundit Glenn Beck said Friday that Ted Cruz was anointed by God to become president. To which God replied, 'No, no, no - I said he was annoying.'"
"Donald Trump has proven himself notoriously unpredictable, except to his butler it turns out, who recently in the 'New York Times,' revealed his secret wardrobe-based system for reading Trump's moods. Turns out, in the morning, 'Mr. Trump would emerge in khakis, a white golf shirt, and baseball cap. If the cap was white, the staff noticed, the boss was in a good mood. If it was red, it was best to stay away.' It's like the old saying, 'Cap of white, friend in sight. Cap of red, we're all dead.'"
"Trump was at yet another town hall last night along with John Kasich and Ted Cruz, and at one point, Ted Cruz was asked about his weaknesses. And admitted that he's hard-charging and has stepped on some toes. Then he was like, 'But enough about my high school prom.'"
"Ted Cruz was also asked about his favorite snack, and he said, quote, 'Between cookies and cheese, you could have a great party.' In related news, Ted Cruz has never been to an actual party."
"I saw that a woman has written an article called 'My Awful Date with Donald Trump,' claiming she went out with Trump in the '70s and he was a boring date and that she had to pay for dinner. Trump's not the only candidate to have an embarrassing story like this come out. Here are a couple others. This person went on a date with Bernie Sanders. She said, 'He asked if I wanted to do something fun, then took me down to Wall Street to yell at buildings. We did that for three, maybe four hours.'"
"This woman went out with Ted Cruz. She said, 'It wasn't really a date. I just noticed he was staring at me across a coffee shop. Then after about an hour he walked over to my table and said, 'That counts' and left.'"
"Donald Trump suggested this morning that his campaign manager, Cory Lewandowski - who has been accused of harshly grabbing a reporter at a rally - could have just been keeping her from falling down. Sure, and Bill Cosby was just helping those ladies get a good night's sleep."

"Anderson Cooper told Donald Trump that he acts like a five-year-old. Trump then laughed really hard and said, 'Well, Cooper rhymes with pooper.'"
"Marco Rubio is in the news. He reportedly wants to play a role in the upcoming Republican convention. Yeah, it all depends on whether they need a sign spinner."
Donald Trump is still very much running for president. He met with the Republican National Committee today. I wish I could have been a part of that meeting. It was like Dr. Frankenstein meeting with his monster.
"President Obama yesterday commuted the sentences of 61 federal prisoners, most of whom were low-level drug offenders. Then he had lunch with a bunch of them. Obama ate lunch with seven former inmates. Usually, former inmates have to be on the team that won the Super Bowl to get invited to the White House for lunch."
"But the President, he's clearly in that kind of senioritis phase of his time in the White House. He's like, 'Screw it, I'm going to lunch with prisoners today. Maybe they'll score me some weed, who knows.'"
"Tomorrow it's April Fool's Day, which means everyone will be waiting for Donald Trump to finally say, 'Gotcha!'"
"I read that if Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are the two nominees, it will be the first time both parties' nominees are over 65 years old, which should explain that one debate where they just play checkers in the park."
"Trump and Hillary would be the oldest nominees since 1848, or as Bernie Sanders put it, 'My first campaign!'"
"After saying in an interview that there should be punishment for women who undergo illegal abortions, Donald Trump last night started to walk back his comments by claiming he meant to say doctors should be punished. And I got to say, it's pretty ironic that Trump had to use 'Plan B.'"
"Donald Trump was in Washington DC today to meet privately with members of his newly established foreign policy team. They went over key points like, 'This one is Europe and, no, no, no, this one is Europe.'"
Bernie Sanders held a campaign rally in the South Bronx. Sanders said it was great to be in the neighborhood where he wasn't the loudest person.
"Hillary Clinton's security held up traffic for a few hours in Manhattan yesterday while Clinton got a $600 haircut. While Bernie Sanders, apparently, got his last haircut in Manhattan traffic."
"We have New Jersey Governor Chris Christie on the show tonight. Which means right now, Donald Trump is unlocking his basement going, 'Oh, no, he escaped.'"
"In an interview yesterday, John Kasich said voters are still learning who he is. And said, quote, 'You go in the store, and there's Coke, there's Pepsi, and then there's Kasich.' Which explains his new slogan, 'John Kasich, the RC Cola of Canada.'"
"I saw that Jeb Bush is going back to giving speeches after his failed run for the Republican nomination. He's actually a very talented motivational speaker because after you listen to his life story, you feel great about yourself."
"Tomorrow, of course, is the Wisconsin presidential primary, which could actually be pivotal for the Republican race for president. While Milwaukee has already played a major role by making all the beer that's helped us through it."
"Over the weekend, Donald Trump told 'The Washington Post' that he'll be able to get the United States completely out of debt in eight years. When asked how, Trump was like, 'Easy, declare bankruptcy and start fresh.'"

"Last week, we mentioned that Jeb Bush is returning to the speaking circuit after his failed run for the Republican nomination. People say he's over the election, but going by the titles of some of his speeches, you can tell it's still on his mind. Check this out. First there's, 'The campaign bus bathroom:Where no one can hear you cry.'"
"Some international news, North Korea officially announced it is blocking Facebook. So it looks like someone forgot to write 'Happy Birthday' on Kim Jong-un's wall."

"Hugh Hefner's ex-girlfriend, Kendra Wilkinson, has endorsed Donald Trump for president, though you'd think she'd support John Kasich's campaign considering she's used to pretending something's still alive when it's really dead."
"Donald Trump is having an extra-hard time with women voters, especially after last week when he said that if abortion becomes illegal, then women that get them should face some sort of punishment. That will not play well with Trump's female supporters, both of them."

"Actually, during a rally last night, Melania Trump pushed back against claims that her husband is sexist and said Donald treats everyone equally. She was like, 'He treats everyone the same whether they're supermodels, swimsuit model, or lingerie model.'"

"If it does come down to Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, if the vote was today, Donald Trump would be in trouble. According to a new Bloomberg poll, Clinton leads Trump in a hypothetical match-up 54%-36%. And this is interesting, 68% of likely general election voters, according to this poll, view Donald Trump negatively. And the other 32% don't have Twitter or television."
"The big news last night was on the Republican side. Ted Cruz won [in Wisconsin]. It was a huge upset, because even if you voted for Ted Cruz, you're still pretty upset about it."
"Trump promised to kill the wasteful Department of Environmental, the DEP. Even the abbreviation is wasteful because that 'P' doesn't stand for anything. Now, we looked it up, and the Department of Environmental does not exist, meaning Trump is either talking out of his [behind], or he's already eliminated it. That's very impressive."
"In the Wisconsin primary, Bernie Sanders won on the Democratic side. Sanders' Wisconsin supporters celebrated by drinking Old Milwaukee."

"In the Wisconsin primary, Ted Cruz beat Donald Trump in Trump's key demographic:voters with only a high school degree. Yeah, this was due to Ted Cruz's new campaign slogan, 'Let's blow off algebra and get high.' It's a good campaign slogan."

"On Tuesday night, Ted Cruz scored a huge win in the Wisconsin primary, which has given him plenty of reason to - I'm going to say, smile? But sure, but his Ted-mentum might be short lived because the campaign has moved to New York, where Cruz has gotten in trouble for criticizing New York values. So here's how Cruz was greeted by this morning's 'New York Daily News.' 'Take The F [U] Train Ted.' Now for you non-New Yorkers, the F [U] Train is a prominent line here in the city. We frequently tell out-of-towners to take it. Of course, it only has one stop and its Ya Mutha's House."
"So Ted Cruz is piling up delegates and gaining on Donald Trump. We might be on our way to what is called a contested convention. ? Here's where it gets super crazy. The GOP could nominate someone who did not even run this year, and - believe it or not - there are some people who did not run this year. Some names have already been floated, like Paul Ryan, Mitt Romney, and Mitt Romney. I know, I just said him, but people forget him so quickly. Now, in an act of desperation, who knows who the GOP will nominate? Could be Scrooge McDuck, a Ouija board that spells out Ronald Reagan, a bald eagle wearing a pair of pleated khakis."
"Texas Rep. Pete Sessions has introduced HR642, a bill recognizing magic as a rare and valuable art form and national treasure. That's right - Congress might actually pass something. Join me now on a journey to the mysterious realm known as the US Congress. Bear witness to this amazing magical bill, which was co-signed by not one, not two, but six other Republican congressmen who are hard at work passing official legislation to recognize that magic 'enables people to experience the impossible. Magic is an art that transforms the ordinary into the extraordinary,' and most of all, that magic 'is timeless in appeal and requires only the capacity to dream.' It's priorities like these that have made congressional approval ratings disappear."
"Hillary Clinton was campaigning in New York today, actually visited Yankee Stadium. Bernie Sanders spent the entire day looking for the Brooklyn Dodgers."
"Over on the Republican side, I saw that Ted Cruz visited a matzah factory in Brooklyn. Of course, matzah is the unleavened bread that Jewish people eat for Passover. And Ted Cruz is the presidential candidate that New Yorkers will definitely pass over."
"I read that Donald Trump seems to have skipped out on his Jewish grandson's circumcision to campaign in Wisconsin. When asked why he wasn't at the ceremony, Trump said getting rid of the top one-percent is the other guy."
"While campaigning in New York today, Hillary Clinton rode the subway and had to swipe her MetroCard five times before getting through a turnstile. Though if you know Hillary Clinton, you know she'll keep trying until she gets in."
"Clinton swiped her MetroCard five times, which means it only took the crowd behind her ten seconds to go from 'Oh my God it's Hillary' to 'Let's go lady!'"
"Hillary rode the subway with a group of reporters and her Secret Service detail. Then after the train was gone, Ted Cruz scurried across the tracks and disappeared into a hole."
"Republican Sen. Jim Risch has come forward to endorse Ted Cruz for president, saying, 'Obviously Kasich is so far behind that it's impossible, really, for him to get the numbers. So by process of elimination, that gets you to Ted Cruz. At this point, there's no choice.' Wow. If that's his endorsement, I'd hate to hear his wedding vows."
"Donald Trump, of course, trying to bounce back from his big defeat in Wisconsin. Had a big loss. He's a little rattled about that. So they're trying stuff. After losing in Wisconsin, there has been a big shake-up in the Trump campaign staff, apparently. In fact, the guy in charge of racist comments is now in charge of sexist comments. So they switched."
"Now some people are saying that John Kasich's campaign might be showing a little bit of life. John Kasich had to move his campaign event to a larger venue when he got more RSVP's than expected. That's a little something good. Kasich said, 'We had to move it from a tollbooth to a Sunglass Hut.' Slightly more room."
"Yesterday, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani announced that he's voting for Donald Trump in the upcoming New York primary. When asked why, Giuliani said, 'Because if he wins, he'll have to move to Washington.'"
Donald Trump announced yesterday that he's changing up his campaign staff and adding a convention manager. Which is the most creative way I've heard someone describe the word 'bouncer.'
"Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka just gave birth last week, and I saw that she's already back on the campaign trail for her dad. Ivanka's friends were like, 'Shouldn't you be with the baby?' And Ivanka was like, 'Yeah, I'm campaigning for him.'"
"In a new interview, Bernie Sanders said that he went to Boy Scout camp in New York. You can tell it was a while ago because Bernie Sanders didn't learn how to make a fire at Boy Scout camp - he discovered fire."
"Pope Francis has invited Bernie Sanders to the Vatican next week. Not for a meeting, just because the Pope wants to pull off a 'Parent Trap' switch and see if anyone notices."
"While we're on the subject of dangerous trends, according to the State Department, virtually every foreign leader who meets with Secretary of State John Kerry has expressed concern about the Republican presidential primary election. Which there's no need to be concerned. It's silly. Once President Trump builds a wall around your country, you'll never see us again."
"According to a new NBC News poll, Donald Trump now has support from 48 percent of Republican voters. All the men and none of the wives is what it is. Ted Cruz is at 27 percent and John Kasich is at third with 18 percent. He won't give up. Even though if you look at this most recent delegate chart, Trump has the lead followed by Cruz, then Marco Rubio who is not in it, and then John Kasich. When a candidate that dropped out two weeks ago has more delegates than you do, in general, it's not a great sign for your election hopes. But John Kasich is refusing to leave. He's like the guy at your house party, at 3:00 am, he's still playing Xbox on the couch."
"Of course, we're just three days away from the big Democratic debate right here in New York. And both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have been busy campaigning throughout the city. Bernie even had some time to see the Broadway show 'Hamilton' with his wife. It got a little awkward when Bernie stood up and said, 'I knew Alexander Hamilton. And you, sir, are no Alexander Hamilton!'"
"Actually, the debate will be held over in Brooklyn. And to keep it authentic to Brooklyn, each candidate will debate by just shouting out a window at each other. 'Your plans are no good!' 'You don't know what you're talking about!'"

"Hillary Clinton is airing her first attack ad against Donald Trump that mentions him by name. Before now, her ads would only refer to Trump as 'A-hole McWeird Hair.'"
"Bernie Sanders won this weekend's Wyoming caucus, which was his seventh win in a row over Hillary Clinton. Clinton said she's still not worried. But it was hard to understand her through the wallet she was biting."

"It does seem like everyone's weighing in on the election these days. In fact, the director of the CIA says that no matter who the next president is, the agency will not use waterboarding ever again. Instead, he's come up with a new way to torture people. Turn off the Wi-Fi when they visit their parents' house."
"The big election news today is Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, who gave a formal speech to clarify that he is definitely not running for president, after no one believed him the last time he said it. ... You know he's going to run. Right? Meanwhile, Trump was like, 'Another one bites the dust. Even people not running are dropping out of the race.'"
"A new poll shows Donald Trump with a 33-point lead ahead of New York's Republican primary. Trump is so confident, he's even stopped doing his hair."
"A new poll has found that Bernie Sanders is the most likable of all the presidential candidates. Which, let's face it, is kind of like being the best dressed person at Walmart."
"The cast of ABC's 'Scandal' is set to appear at a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton later this month, unless she loses in New York, in which case she would like to speak with the folks at 'How to Get Away with Murder.'"
House Speaker Paul Ryan this afternoon issued a formal statement ruling himself out as a potential replacement candidate if there's a contested Republican convention. And you know things are bad in the Republican Party when people who aren't even running are dropping out of the race.
"The White House Science Fair is tomorrow, and once again, Joe Biden waited until today to start his volcano."
"Yes, in the news today, it's come out that President Obama has been allowed to see special advance episodes of the new season, 'Game of Thrones.' The President gets to see advance episodes. Obama says he watches 'Game of Thrones' to remind him what it's like to have reasonably sane people compete for leadership."
"According to some analysts, Donald Trump's support is deeper than it looks. Although others say Trump just took the support he has and combed it over to make it look better."
"Today, John Kasich gave a 30-minute speech in New York City. Afterwards, the crowd applauded Kasich and then put $8.34 in his hat."
"In a recent interview, Ted Cruz's wife, Heidi, said that Donald Trump's nasty tweet about her looks did not impact her. Heidi Cruz said, 'Part of my marriage vow to Ted was to give up all human feeling.' So she's in pretty good shape."
"Donald Trump is still very much focused on winning. ... While he was speaking, a fight broke out in the crowd. Somebody got video [as] these two guys went at it. It's unclear whether the fight broke out at the rally, or if the fight started first and turned into a Trump rally. But you know, when you see the footage from these rallies, I feel like there will come a day when a monster truck gets elected President of the United States."
"The race for president of the United States looks like it's going be rocky for the Republican Party. They could be headed for a contested convention, and some prominent Republican congressmen are saying they might not even go to the convention, which is in Cleveland next summer. Not because it might get crazy. They're saying they can't go because they have work to do this summer, which - these are congressmen - all of a sudden they've got work to do? Maybe they just don't want to spend the weekend in Cleveland."
"Here's what everybody is talking about, of course. It's the big New York primary, which happens next Tuesday, which is looking pretty good for Hillary Clinton. In fact, the website?538 says Hillary has a 99 percent chance of winning the primary for New York. When he heard, Bernie Sanders said, 'My God, I've become part of the one percent!'"
"Last night, CNN hosted a town hall with Republican frontrunner Donald Trump, and at one point he complained that the rules of the election are stacked against him by the establishment. You got to give it to Trump. I mean, he's the only man who could inherit millions of dollars, have his name on buildings and still go, 'Life is totally unfair. I can't catch a break!'"
"Donald Trump's son, Eric, said last night that his father is his 'best friend in the entire world.' Said Donald, 'Right back at ya, Jeff.'"
"Bernie Sanders this morning joined the Verizon worker picket line here in New York. It's a perfect match, because Bernie always talks like he's getting bad reception."
"Bernie Sanders today received his first senatorial endorsement, from Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, or - as he'll be known under President Hillary Clinton - ambassador to North Korea Jeff Merkley."
"The New York MTA has announced that they plan to phase out MetroCards by 2021. 'But I just learned,' said Hillary. 'Oh, please don't make it something harder.'"
"Even though there's a big primary in New York Tuesday, Bernie is headed to the Vatican tomorrow to make a speech. Going all the way to the Vatican to make a 15-minute speech, and the Pope isn't even going to be there. Why he's doing this? Even people running his campaign don't know. Maybe he wants to get in good with God since they'll probably be meeting soon."
"But Bernie will be out of the country for a bit. But don't worry, his supporters will still be on Facebook yelling at you."
"Donald Trump has new enemies. Several former contestants from his show 'The Apprentice' are speaking out against him, including season one runner up Kwame Jackson. And I'll tell you something, when season one runner-up Kwame Jackson speaks, people stop and listen."
"The former 'Apprentice' contestants issued a joint statement saying they don't believe Trump is 'worthy of becoming President of the United States.' Trump responded very graciously. To his credit, he released a statement calling them six failing wannabes and said they should be careful or 'I'll play hours of footage of them individually praising me.' This is great. His 'Apprentice' contestants turning on him. This is like the cast of 'Survivor' deciding to eat Jeff Probst."
"Yesterday Trump met with one of his arch nemeses:Megyn Kelly of Fox News. She went to his office. They talked for an hour. In the end, they agreed to put aside their differences and get back to what's important, which is getting white people very angry."
"Tonight was the big Democratic debate between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. They discussed important issues such as national security, the economy, and whose supporters are the most annoying on Facebook."
"Over 27,000 people attended a massive rally for Bernie Sanders in Manhattan's Washington Square Park. Well, technically, 7,000 people showed up for Bernie, while 20,000 New Yorkers just saw a line and got in it."
"After Donald Trump said that the Republican primary process is unfair, the RNC chairman responded that Trump should have known the rules a year ago. In Trump's defense, he didn't expect anyone would fall for this a year ago."
"Producers for 'Game of Thrones' confirmed that President Obama has requested and will receive episodes of the show's new season before it airs on HBO. You know, so he can call up the Republicans and spoil it for them."
"Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders debated in Brooklyn earlier this evening, which means Hillary began swiping her MetroCard sometime this morning."
"During their family town hall event on CNN last night, Ted Cruz's wife revealed that their daughters want Taylor Swift to be their first guest to visit the White House. Aw, that's so cute. They think he has a chance."
"During last night's town hall, Ted Cruz talked about how his daughters often play a game with him called 'Attack the Daddy.' Said his daughters, 'It's not a game.'"
"Over 27,000 people attended Bernie Sanders' rally in Washington Square Park last night, which is especially crazy, since Bernie only went to the park to play chess."
Bernie Sanders is visiting Rome tomorrow. He'll be flying middle class.
Just a reminder that this Monday is Tax Day. That one day of the year even Democrats turn into Republicans. You know what I'm saying?
"On Thursday night, CNN hosted the ninth Democratic debate featuring Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. And after a lot of rowdy Republican debates, people were looking forward to a more focused, calm exchange between the two Democrats. ... I haven't seen two liberals that angry since two Priuses crashed in a Whole Foods parking lot."
[Imitating Sanders] 'This is what you do do.' No wonder Bernie's the number two candidate now.
"I saw that several alumni of 'The Apprentice' held a press conference to say that Donald Trump should not be president. While on the other hand, Gary Busey went to the park to register squirrels to vote."
"Ted Cruz and his wife appeared in a town hall on CNN recently. And Ted Cruz's wife said that after they got back from their honeymoon, Ted bought 100 cans of Campbell's Chunky soup. But to be fair, I feel like anyone who has watched this election is probably stocking up on canned goods."
"Cruz's daughters were also at the town hall. They said that if they end up in the White House, they want to have Taylor Swift over for dinner. Then Ted Cruz said, 'I hope she likes Chunky soup, because I have 200 cans in the living room.'"
"The President and the First Lady got their taxes done. I'm not sure if they have to release it or they just do. They made $436,065 - about ten percent less than they did last year and the lowest amount they've made since he took office. Donald Trump made more money than that last year selling hats."
"The winner of the New York primary, you know, gets delegates, momentum, and most importantly two tickets in the front mezzanine to see 'Hamilton.' Because we have a time difference to contend with, we don't know who won, but all we know is that Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump won."
It's interesting to see how many of the candidates in this particular primary have some kind of a home-field advantage. Bernie Sanders was born in Brooklyn. Donald Trump is from Queens. And Hillary Clinton is from wherever you need her to be from.
"Donald Trump had a bit of a stumble yesterday. You may have heard about this. He was giving a speech in Buffalo and accidentally referred to the devastating terrorist attacks of 7/11, instead of 9/11. And, of course, who can forget that fateful day when the Coke-flavored Slurpee machine broke and we were forced to settle for that blue raspberry stuff."
"According to a new NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, more than half of voters say they wouldn't support Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, or Hillary Clinton. Which is depressing because that's probably who will be on the ballot. It's like lunch in a middle-school cafeteria. None of the choices are good, but you have to eat something, right?"
"Of course, on the Republican side, Donald Trump is heavily favored to win tonight's primary. New York is his home town, and he's been married to many of its voters."
"But Trump's victory may not be enough to avoid a contested convention. That is where no candidate has no majority of delegates, freeing up those delegates to vote for anyone they think would be most appealing to the American public. So the next GOP presidential nominee could be a 'Gilmore Girls' reboot."
"But the hot name on a lot of Republican lips right now is Speaker of the House Paul Ryan. ... They believe he would be a better alternative to Trump and Cruz, more likely to attract moderate voters and less likely to haunt your Robitussin-induced nightmares."
"Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton moved closer to a face-off in the general election last night. They were the winners in the New York primary by a wide margin. Hillary got 58 percent of the vote. Trump got more than 60 percent of the vote. I like to imagine him up in his tower looking over the city last night, rubbing his little hands together like a Batman villain."
The Empire State Building turned red last night when Trump was declared the winner. I'm guessing out of embarrassment.
Trump needs 57 percent of the remaining delegates to get the nomination. Ted Cruz needs 98 percent of the remaining delegates and John Kasich needs 158 percent. So he really needs to step this up.
"It was a disappointing night for Bernie Sanders and Ted Cruz. In one district, Ted Cruz lost to Ben Carson, who isn't even running anymore. Even when he was running, I'm not sure he knew he was running."
"Speaking of things that money can buy - the 2016 election. Did you guys vote in yesterday's New York primary? Great. Well, that means you did your part for democracy, and as a reward, you're now eligible for jury duty. And the results were a good old-fashioned Empire State boot-stomping by Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. New Yorkers haven't seen a thrashing this bad since any Knicks game."
"On the Democratic side, it was a tough choice for New Yorkers. You go to the polls, you see old ladies working there, you want to make them happy, but you don't know. Have they been waiting their whole lives for a woman president, or are they friends with Bernie from aqua-aerobics?"
"Of course, the clearest message coming out of New York last night was, 'Suck it, Ted Cruz. Suck our New York values.' Because Cruz got just 15 percent of the vote, and in one county, he even lost to Ben Carson, who dropped out of the race a month ago. Though, to be fair, Dr. Carson may not be aware that he dropped out of the race."
"For Trump, of course, last night was total domination. He won 60 percent of the vote, taking every district except one, Manhattan, which went to Gov. John Kasich. After picking up 90 delegates, Trump has his sights set on the Republican Convention in Cleveland. ? But this is likely going to be a contested convention, where if no one wins the first round of voting, delegates can switch their votes to any other candidate they want. And it is not against the rules to woo these delegates with any gifts, including money or jobs or the most precious prize of all:A ticket out of Cleveland."
"Well, if you're following the news you know that the 2016 Republican primary toboggan ride is rapidly approaching the oak tree of their summer convention, and if you think that you're worried about what is going to happen in this race, just consider Reince Priebus, RNC chairman and man whose name is an anagram for Crisp Bee Urine."
"Reince is in a really tough spot right now. As his party approaches a contested convention, it appears to be going up in flames. As he told reporters yesterday, 'Sometimes you can't fix it. Sometimes you can just take a seven-alarm fire and make it a four-alarm fire. It's still burning but not as bad as it was.' Okay, okay, very happy. Not as bad as it was, Reince. You understand how fire departments work, right? You're not allowed to leave and say, 'Hey, I think we put a dent in it. Good luck.'"
"I read that sales for Donald Trump pi?atas have been soaring recently. Or as Donald Trump put it, 'Told you I could make the Mexicans pay for something.'"
"Apparently four out of Donald Trump's five airplanes are more than 20 years old, which they say is rare for most billionaires. I guess Trump doesn't know you're supposed to change planes every few years and keep your wife forever."
One photo everybody is talking about is this one of two-year-old Prince George actually meeting the President in his bathrobe. You know you're royalty when you're a two-year-old in pajamas meeting the President and you still look like you're running the show.
"Yesterday, Donald Trump said - this is a quote - 'If I lose, I don't think you'll ever see me again.' In other words, a Trump campaign promise we can all get behind."
"In order to block Donald Trump's path to the Republican nomination, John Kasich is pulling his campaign out of Indiana. Indiana should notice sometime...in 2018. That's a big operation when it unfolds. It's two guys and a gerbil."
"A restaurant in Pennsylvania has unveiled a pizza inspired by Hillary Clinton. Apparently the pizza is not that fresh or tasty, but it sticks around your stomach until all the other food has given up."
"Hillary Clinton said Pennsylvania is where she learned to shoot a gun. Meanwhile, Bernie Sanders said Pennsylvania is where he learned to load a musket."
"A growing number of rappers are coming out for Bernie Sanders. Which is why today Sanders revealed his new rap name, 'Old Cranky Bastard.'"
John Kasich and Ted Cruz's campaigns announced on Sunday an agreement between the candidates wherein Cruz will not compete in New Mexico and Oregon and Kasich will do the same in Indiana. This Cruz/Kasich team-up is like the Wonder Twins if they had far worse powers.
"John Kasich and Ted Cruz have formed a 'Game of Thrones'-like alliance to stop Trump. The plan is to coordinate which states they compete in. For example, Cruz isn't going to devote any resources in Oregon and Nevada where Kasich believes he has more of a shot. And in return, Cruz is going to dominate Indiana. As long as they do it three months ago, it just might work."
"Want to say Happy Birthday to Melania Trump, who turned 46 today. She spent her birthday like she always does, telling Donald that she's 23."
"Of course, today was another big day for the election. There were five different primaries, in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island. Or as Hillary Clinton put it, 'Why, those just happen to be my five favorite states.'"
"Over the weekend, Hillary Clinton called Donald Trump a loose cannon and said, quote, 'Loose cannons tend to misfire.' Trump was like, 'My cannon works just fine, I guarantee it. There's no problem.'"
"Things are really looking up for Donald Trump. According to a new poll, 50 percent of Republicans say they could support Donald Trump. The other 50 percent are a group calling themselves women."
Hillary Clinton has been attacking Donald Trump over his country-club lifestyle. Hillary made the remarks during a speech none of us could afford to attend.
"Donald Trump is now making fun of what he calls John Kasich's disgusting table manners. ... As an example, Trump named Kasich's gross habit of having dinner with a wife who's about his own age."
"In a new interview, Ted Cruz said, 'I've changed a lot of diapers.' After hearing this, Bernie Sanders made him his running mate."
"Both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump were favored to sweep today's primaries in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island. And John Kasich is still polling very high in the state of denial."
"Hillary Clinton gave a speech yesterday on gun control and said that she's gone hunting before, but said she hasn't really had much chance to do it in recent years. And she didn't use a gun. She just gives the deer one of these [looks] and it falls over dead."
"Dr. Ben Carson said in a new interview that he thinks Harriet Tubman would likely be turning over in her grave if she found out her image were being placed on the $20 bill while the country was in debt. Though I think she'd more likely say, 'A black doctor? Okay. Yeah, there's black doctors. You can put me on whatever you want.'"
"You know, tonight after all the speculation, after all the campaigning and craziness and this unprecedented cartoonish election, we seem to be down to two candidates:Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. ? Nobody seems to like them, but they're both way ahead in the delegate count. While it's not officially over, it's over. Everyone knows it except John Kasich, Bernie Sanders, and Ted Cruz. At this point, the only chance these guys have of stopping Clinton and Trump is an angry Beyonc? with a baseball bat."
"Ted Cruz, you almost have to hand it to Ted Cruz. Even though he lost all five primaries last night, today he named a running mate. He named Carly Fiorina as his running mate. For what, I don't know. Maybe they plan to go running together. I don't know."
"What a phone call that must have been. 'Carly, would you like to lose to Donald Trump together?'"
"[Referring to Sen. Ted Cruz's speech in which he called a basketball hoop a basketball ring.] Until now I thought Ted Cruz was a senator trying to convince us he could be president. Now I think he's an alien trying to convince us he's a human being. I, personally, have never heard anybody call a basketball hoop a ring, but maybe that's just me."
"Meanwhile, Ted Cruz isn't the only candidate suffering from a bout of delusion. Bernie Sanders floated the idea of asking Elizabeth Warren to be his running mate. All of a sudden it's like vice president fantasy football. Everybody is picking a running mate."
"Bernie said the women of this country understand that it would be a great idea to have a woman as vice president. Yeah, or as president, right? I mean, some would argue that would be better than vice."
It's a tough night for Bernie Sanders. His campaign right now is about as alive as the Bernie from 'Weekend at Bernie's.'
"He's vowed to keep running, or at least mall-walking. One of the two. Today the Sanders campaign announced they're downsizing their campaign staff. They're firing hundreds of people, but, nevertheless, he's vowed to stay in the race until voting wraps in June, or until his life ends, whichever comes first."
"Donald Trump, meanwhile, says he considers himself to be the presumptive nominee, which is something he probably would consider himself to be whether he was winning or not."
"Yesterday, it was a huge night for Hillary Clinton, who won four-out-of-five states, though Bernie Sanders did clinch Rhode Island - the participation trophy of primary caucuses."
"The word is these losses have forced Sanders to reassess his campaign and lay off hundreds of staff members. So, it might be time for supporters to stop feeling the Bern and just head for the Hills."
"Donald Trump swept all five states and picked up so many delegates that it's looking more than ever like this fall the choice will be between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, the match-up America did something to deserve."
"On the other hand, yesterday was tough for Ted Cruz. The only state he won was denial."
"Of course, yesterday was a huge win for Donald Trump, who won all five of the primaries in the states of Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island. Yep, during his victory speech, Trump called it a diverse victory."
"Trump had a great day yesterday, sweeping all five state primaries. Afterwards, he said, 'Usually, my maid does all the sweeping, but tonight, it was all me. I'll take credit for the sweeping everything.'"
"Hillary Clinton also had a pretty good night. But so far, Bernie is refusing to drop out. ... It's tense between them. And it's so tense that one top Democratic strategist said that the only person who can ease tensions between Hillary and Bernie Sanders is Joe Biden. Or as Joe Biden put it, 'Looks like it's time for a double massage.'"
"Today, Carly Fiorina was announced as Ted Cruz's running mate. Fiorina says it's always been her lifelong dream to lose twice in the same election."
"She's not the only former candidate keeping busy. I read that Martin O'Malley and Mike Huckabee might actually be starting a bipartisan rock band together. The band has a great way to make money. The concerts are free, but ear plugs cost $200."
"Donald Trump swept last night's Republican primaries and Hillary Clinton won four-of-the-five Democratic races. So it looks like the general election is gonna be the billionaire versus the unstoppable force. In other words, it's gonna suck."
"In his victory speech last night, Donald Trump pointed out that John Kasich has only won one of Republican primaries, and asked his supporters, 'Why he is here.' While Chris Christie was clearly asking himself, 'Why am I here?'"
"Donald Trump last night closed his victory speech with a swipe at Hillary Clinton, and said, quote, 'The only card she has is the women's card.' Said Hillary, 'It's called Marshalls.'"
"During his victory speech last night, Donald Trump dismissed the idea of facing a contested convention, saying, 'As far as I'm concerned, it's over.' And by 'it', I assume he means civilization as we know it."
Ted Cruz gave his concession speech last night from an Indiana gym where the movie 'Hoosiers' was shot. While John Kasich gave his speech in the place where they shoot 'The Walking Dead.'
"Donald Trump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, said yesterday that 'despite calls on the candidate to become more presidential, he will never change.' And it's all because of that note he got in his high school yearbook."
A restaurant in Pennsylvania has started selling a pizza inspired by Hillary Clinton topped with buffalo chicken and hot sauce. They also have a Trump pizza - it doesn't have any toppings but the crust is folded over to hide it.
"Five primaries last night and, folks, it's starting to look official. That's right, Donald Trump now appears to be the likely Republican nominee. ... In a related story, Canada is getting ready for 45 million people to come crash on their couch."
"Donald Trump said he's going to have to get used to Hillary Clinton's shouting. After hearing this, Bill Clinton said, 'You never really get used to it. Not something you get used to.'"
"Earlier today, despite losing five primaries, Ted Cruz stunned everybody by announcing his vice presidential candidate is Carly Fiorina. He loses five primaries and announces, 'Hey, Fiorina's my vice president.' This means Fiorina is a heartbeat away from never being president."
"Yes, Ted Cruz has found a running mate. As the former head of Hewlett-Packard, Fiorina is the perfect choice to balance the ticket and save some money on toner."
"Of course, Ted Cruz isn't alone. All the candidates are starting to vet their potential VPs. So for everyone out there on the short list, here are tips on how to be the most appealing running mate possible. ? My first tip:You have to prep for the State of the Union, where, as far as I can tell, the vice president's job is to blink, clap, and occasionally stand up. So to practice, just stare at a bright light in a room full of mosquitoes."
"Tip number two:You're going to want to attract a key voting demo, so consider having a Hispanic last name."
"Tip three:As a vice president, you will be sent to places the president does not want to go. So practice this by going to Costco on a Sunday morning."
"Finally, a scandal is terrible for any campaign, which means no skeletons in the closet. So try not to have done anything for the last 30 years, which will be good training for what you will be doing as vice president."
"After appearing together as running mates, Ted Cruz and Carly Fiorina even started releasing some of their campaign slogans. Check this out. First there's, 'Cruz/Fiorina, The Number Three and Number Eight Choice for America.'"
"Next there's, 'Cruz/Fiorina, Sometimes You Just Get What You Get.'"
"And finally there's, 'Cruz/Fiorina, We Sound a Little Like Two Ford Compact Cars.'"
"During his foreign policy speech yesterday, Donald Trump mispronounced Tanzania and called it 'Tanzainia.' Then Melania was like, 'That's nothing. My name is actually Kathryn.'"
"Donald Trump yesterday gave his first major speech on foreign policy and pushed for what he called an 'America First' stance. Though really his stance is more like, America first, then Czechoslovakia, then Slovenia."
"During Donald Trump's foreign policy speech yesterday, he said when it comes to military action, we have to be unpredictable. Scary news for Iran, but terrifying news for Canada."
"Donald Trump yesterday gave his first foreign policy speech and accused President Obama of handling Iran with tender lovin' care. 'Sometimes that works, dad,' said Eric and Donald Jr."
Exit polls from Tuesday's primary showed Donald Trump won about 50 percent of Republican voters with college degrees. Well technically they have college degrees. Their diploma was a steak.
"Former House Speaker John Boehner spoke about Ted Cruz and told reporters, 'I get along with almost everyone, but I've never worked with a more miserable son of a [expletive] in my life.' Keep in mind, Boehner used to work with Dennis Hastert."
"Of course, last night was the NFL draft. ... The Los Angeles Rams used the first pick to select quarterback Jared Goff. He's a college student who just got a job worth over $20 million, or as he put it, 'I no longer support Bernie Sanders.'"
"Back in Washington, the White House Correspondents Dinner is tomorrow. And I read that Bernie Sanders will be attending. You can tell Bernie Sanders was a guest at the dinner when they had to schedule it at 3:00 pm."
"The White House Correspondents' Dinner was on Saturday. And President Obama ended his speech by saying 'Obama out,' and literally dropping the mic. Then Hillary Clinton caught the mic midair and said, 'Let's do this.'"
"The White House announced yesterday Malia Obama will attend Harvard University, but that she plans to take a year off before starting. Malia got the idea after seeing how much fun her dad is having with his year off."
"Things not going very well right now for Ted Cruz. At a Ted Cruz rally, a young boy yelled, 'You suck' at Ted Cruz. A little kid. In other words, there is hope for America's future after all."
"At a campaign rally this week, Ted Cruz's running mate, Carly Fiorina, fell off the stage. I'm not saying she's unpopular, but even Carly Fiorina's ankles don't support her."
"Bernie Sanders also having his problems. As his campaign is winding down, he had to fire hundreds of staff members, hundreds. Now Bernie is down to a campaign director, speech writer, and a 22-year-old whose job is to keep explaining to him what Snapchat is, over and over again."
The White House Correspondents' Dinner was this weekend. President Obama said it was fun. Larry Wilmore said he was honored. And Bernie Sanders said the portions were too small.
"The White House Correspondents' Dinner was this weekend, and though it's a black tie event, Bernie Sanders did not wear a tuxedo. Sanders instead opted for a more subdued style that he called, quote, 'My only suit.'"
"Indiana is holding its primary tomorrow, and Donald Trump is currently leading Ted Cruz by 15 points. While John Kasich still holds a narrow lead over...not sure."
"Uber...the car pickup service, they're going to start charging passengers a fee if you show up more than two minutes after the car shows up to get you. Apparently this happens a lot. The drivers have to wait for the people to come downstairs, and during that time they don't get paid. That annoys them. It used to be we were told not to get in a car with a stranger. Now it's get in a car with a stranger within two minutes or else."
"Today was the Indiana primary, and the results are in. Donald Trump saw his shadow, so there are six more months of the election."
"Actually, most people are considering this to be Ted Cruz's last stand, so he's going after Donald Trump here. Today, he even claimed that Trump has never asked God for forgiveness for anything. And said, quote, 'I've asked God for forgiveness three times today.' God's like, 'Yeah, I know, I didn't pick up.'"
"Yesterday, Heidi Cruz was asked about rumors that her husband is the Zodiac Killer. And said, quote, 'I've been married to him for 15 years, and I know pretty well who he is.' That story again, Heidi Cruz didn't actually deny that her husband was the Zodiac Killer."
"Donald Trump just picked up another endorsement. ... He was endorsed by former Notre Dame football coach Lou Holtz, after also receiving an endorsement from former Indiana basketball coach Bobby Knight. So if you're wondering how Donald Trump will defeat ISIS, it's by challenging them to a college sporting event in 1985."
"A 100-year-old woman from right here in New York City just broke the world record for her age group in the 100-meter dash. In fact, they say she's the oldest person to enter a race since Bernie Sanders."
"Indiana had its primary today, and Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump were projected to have big wins that could help them officially lock up their respective races. Hillary may lock up the Democratic race, and Trump may lock up the Hispanic race."
"When asked in an interview today about the Indiana primary, Hillary Clinton said, 'I'm really focused on moving into the general election.' And if you think that's overconfident, she was talking about the next one."
"Today in Indiana, Ted Cruz called Donald Trump 'a pathological liar,' 'narcissist,' 'utterly immoral,' and 'a serial philanderer.' Then Cruz turned to Trump and said, 'Teach me, master, teach me the ways.'"
"Donald Trump is now implying that Ted Cruz's father had something to do with the Kennedy assassination. Even worse, it's also been reported that Ted Cruz's father had something to do with Ted Cruz."

"A high school girl brought a cardboard cutout of Bernie Sanders as her prom date. Meanwhile, another girl brought a cardboard cutout of John Kasich that turned out to be John Kasich."
"The Indiana primary was today, and we're this much closer to having a president that starts Twitter fights with Cher."
"Trump now leads Ted Cruz by 42 points, which is too many points. Ted Cruz is like the college roommate who wouldn't leave when your girlfriend came over because maybe he secretly wanted you to do it in front of him."
"Trump is trying to spread the tabloid story that Ted Cruz's dad is somehow involved in the assassination of JFK. ... The story was published in the 'National Inquirer,' but they claim to have a photograph of Ted's father with Lee Harvey Oswald three months before JFK was killed. This is the photo. He's right next to Forrest Gump."
"Today, of course, is the important Indiana primary. And because we tape early, I don't know who won yet, but I do know it was do-or-die for Sen. Ted Cruz. And judging by this picture, I'm going to say he died about a week ago."
Ted Cruz has been focusing on the Indiana primary for weeks now. He has really put all his eggs in this basket. And I want to be perfectly clear:'His eggs' is a common expression. I'm not saying he's a reptile who reproduces through hatchlings.
"The Indiana primary was today, and the winner was, of course, Donald Trump. But the big news was that Ted Cruz ended his presidential campaign. ... I can't believe Cruz is quitting the race. I mean, who quits just because they've lost? Why today? He'd been losing for months!"
"Cruz said he's looking forward to being able to spend more time with his family. In response, his family said, 'Are you sure you want to quit?'"
"Ted Cruz suspending his campaign is great news for the only other candidate, John Kasich, who is now just waiting for Donald Trump to drop out. And then if the Democratic Party disbands, it's going to be a cakewalk."
"To sum it up, Ted Cruz dropped out of the race, while Carly Fiorina just dropped. In fairness to Fiorina, you try saying that Ted Cruz will be our next president without getting woozy and falling down. On the bright side, this might be the only time when falling down is actually way less embarrassing than standing next to someone."
"[Sen. Ted Cruz] picked his running mate, Carly Fiorina, six days before he dropped out. That's not even two episodes of 'Game of Thrones' they were running together."
"This morning I went on the Cruz/Fiorina website that they made, and they still had things for sale. You could by a Ted Cruz/Carly Fiorina yard sign. You could buy buttons or this terrifying poster. The site even issued a warning that some of the items are back ordered and may take up to two weeks to ship, which means the shipping time was longer than the actual time of their campaign."
"And then today after Ted Cruz, Ohio Gov. John Kasich dropped out. That's a shame. He was just starting to get going."
"Meanwhile, on the Democrat side, Bernie Sanders beat Hillary Clinton in Indiana last night. He got 53 percent of the vote. The exit polls show Sanders again beating Clinton among young voters, among white voters, independents, and voters who are fans of the bed-head look."
"Bernie says he will not go quietly into the night, primarily because he has to get up every two hours to pee."
"The next big battle for the Democrats is on Saturday. The Guam caucus, which sounds like an STD, but it's a thing."
Donald Trump will be the first major party nominee who hasn't held previous office since Gen. Dwight Eisenhower. Eisenhower faced down Hitler in World War II. Trump faced down Gilbert Gottfried at his Comedy Central roast.
"John Kasich has ended his bid for the White House. He may be gone, but he is not - who are we talking about again?"
"Let us look back on the campaign of Cruz. Though he captured 11 states, he failed to win lasting alliances. John Boehner called him 'Lucifer in the flesh.' His old college roommate said, 'Ted Cruz is a nightmare of a human being.' And his colleague Lindsey Graham gave this endorsement, 'If you killed Ted Cruz on the floor of the Senate and the trial was in the Senate, nobody would convict you.' So if Ted Cruz is ever killed, we can narrow the suspects down to someone who has met him."
"After last night's Indiana primary, it's starting to look like we finally have our two candidates for president. That's right. It's down to 'uh-oh' versus 'I guess.'"
"After winning the Indiana primary, Donald Trump is now set to become the first major party nominee without political experience since Dwight Eisenhower, who was a five-star general during World War II. When Trump heard that, he was like, 'Big deal, I'm going to be president for World War III.'"
"Of course, the other big story is that Ted Cruz dropped out of the presidential race last night, just a week after announcing Carly Fiorina as his running mate. Carly said she was disappointed that it was over, but still excited to lay off the campaign staff."
"John Kasich also suspended his campaign less than 24 hours after Ted Cruz. When asked why he waited this long, Kasich said, 'So at least I could say I got second place.'"
"Virgin America announced that it's teaming up with the 'Rock the Vote' campaign to encourage passengers to register to vote while in the air. While most people see the candidates and just say, 'Any way we can just stay up here and just keep circling? Circle for four years?'"
"Ted Cruz has officially dropped out of the presidential race. And it's an odd feeling, honestly. It's kind of like when you have a party at your house, and there's an awful guy who creeps everybody out, and it's super late, and he finally, finally leaves. And as you close the door behind him and you let out a sigh of relief, then all of a sudden you hear a voice say, 'We should get some more beers.'"
"John Kasich has officially dropped out of the presidential race. So, if you were a big John Kasich fan - no you weren't."
"After a bitter campaign season, in which he won his home state of Ohio only, John Kasich today suspended his presidential campaign. Now he can go back to his old job - playing the cool math teacher in a teen show on the Disney channel."
"During his victory speech, Donald Trump said he wants to bring unity to the Republican Party. Trump said, 'I've loved the Republican Party ever since I joined it eight months ago.'"
"Yesterday, the big story, too, Ted Cruz dropped out of the race. When Donald Trump heard that Cruz dropped out, Trump told his supporters, 'See, I've already kept one Hispanic from taking an American job.'"
"Now that Donald Trump is the nominee, some Republicans are saying they'll vote for Hillary Clinton. In fact, Hillary's gotten so confident, today she strolled into Congress and said, 'Hey, who wants to talk Benghazi, huh? Ask me anything!'"
"Yesterday, Bernie Sanders said, 'I sense some great victories coming.' Sanders made the statement two hours after eating a large bowl of fiber."
"Bernie Sanders said yesterday that he intends to do everything that he can to prevent a Donald Trump presidency. Though, I don't know what he can try that Donald Trump hasn't tried already."
"Yesterday, President Obama drank tap water in Flint, Michigan, to show it was safe. Yes, he drank tap water. Then he was offered a Chipotle burrito and he said, 'Are you...crazy?'"
Everybody is getting into the spirit for Mother's Day. Even Donald Trump. Check out the tweet he sent. 'Happy Mother's Day. The best tuna casserole is made at Trump Tower Grill. I love mothers.'
"After speaking out against Donald Trump's plan to build a border wall, former Mexican President Vicente Fox has invited Trump to Mexico as a peace offering. Fox says, 'When you land, just look for my driver, El Chapo.'"
"That's right, former Mexican President Vicente Fox has invited Donald Trump to Mexico to see the border from the other side. Then Trump invited Vicente Fox to Trump Tower Grill to see what real Mexican food tastes like."
"I saw that Jeb Bush wrote a Facebook post congratulating Donald Trump for securing the Republican nomination, but said he still won't support him. That's right, Jeb wrote an insincere Facebook post, or as it's also known, a Facebook post."
"That's right, Jeb Bush announced on Facebook that he will not support Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton. Even worse, the only two likes on that post were from Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton."
"On 'Meet the Press' yesterday, Donald Trump said he would like to see minimum wage increased, saying, quote, 'I don't know how people make it on $7.25 an hour.' Then his butler said, 'Just barely, sir.'"

A recent study found that Bernie Sanders' economic plan would add $18 trillion to the national debt. The study was conducted by famed economist 'Millary Flinton.'
North Korea's ruling political party announced today that they will be giving leader Kim Jong-un a new title. I'm going to guess - is it the heavyweight title?

Ann Coulter is coming out with a book praising Donald Trump. Just what Trump needed - the support of yet one more angry white man.
"Hillary Clinton had a good Mother's Day weekend. She won the caucuses in Guam on Saturday, moving her another inch closer. The Guam caucuses are different. The winner gets a bag of mangoes."
"I saw that Donald Trump supporters are upset with the show 'Family Guy' after it recently made fun of Trump. I see both sides of the issue. On one hand, it's just a cartoon. But that cartoon could be president of the United States."
"Now that Trump is the only one left on the Republican side, he's starting to set his sights on Hillary Clinton. But Hillary dismissed Trump's attacks, especially on her personal life, saying he's using a playbook from the '90s. Which backfired when Americans were like, 'Oh, my God, we love the '90s.'"
"Yesterday the State Department said that it can't find any emails belonging to Hillary Clinton's senior technology staffer from when Clinton was secretary of State. Then Hillary said, 'You won't find that staffer either.'"

"North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un has been given a new title:Chairman of the Worker's Party. Narrowly beat out his second choice, 'Mother of Dragons.'"
"A new poll shows that Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump would be tied in Florida, if the presidential election were held today. Of course, Trump comes into Florida with a huge advantage on account of being the state fruit."

"Donald Trump is expected to do very well in West Virginia, partly because he has no opponents and because the state's demographics fit his four main supportive categories:white voters, older voters, those that have been struck repeatedly in the head with large lumps of coal."
[Donald Trump] has selected current New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie to lead his transition team. Christie has been a key adviser. It surprises me he has advisers. Where were they when he went on Facebook to post that taco bowl? That's the story Chris Christie should be advising on. The man is built on taco bowls.
"Chris Christie, even though he's an adviser, he's not ruling out the possibility to be Trump's running mate. He said he will block that bridge when he gets to it."
"Donald Trump is accusing Hillary Clinton of enabling Bill Clinton's affairs. That's what he said this weekend, which Trump frowns on because he was able to accomplish all of his affairs on his own, did it himself."
"Trump even said that Hillary was nasty and mean to the women who slept with her husband. Trump's wives did not treat his mistresses like that at all. They had the courtesy to let him marry them. 'Tag, you're it! He's all yours!'"
"[Referring to Tuesday's West Virginia Democratic presidential primary] Sen. Bernie Sanders won the primary last night. For a guy with no chance of winning, he sure does seem to win a lot. He wins, like, every week. Hillary Clinton could lose all the remaining primaries, and she'll still get the nomination. At this point, Bernie has a better chance of being drafted by an NBA team than being the nominee."
"Donald Trump took time this morning to give Bernie a nickname. He tweeted, 'I don't want to hit Crazy Bernie Sanders too hard yet because I love what he's doing to Crooked Hillary. His time will come.' Now, that's 'Lying Ted,' 'Little Marco,' and 'Crooked Hillary' and the new nickname, 'Crazy Bernie.' It's like the Spice Girls. Everybody has a little name."
"But a lot of Republicans, including Paul Ryan, who's the Speaker of the House, and Ted Cruz are saying they're not ready to support Donald Trump. What do you have to do to get ready to support someone? Is it like getting bikini ready? Do you have to [be] shaved or waxed in certain places?"

Fifty-nine percent think he was not born in the United States. Twenty-seven percent think vaccines cause autism. Twenty-four percent think Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia was murdered. And seventeen percent think he was murdered by OJ.

"Before we go any further, right off the bean, I have to take a moment right now to congratulate a friend of the show, Stephen Curry, for being named the NBA MVP. Well deserved. Because he won unanimously, all 131 votes. Yet, somehow, Hillary Clinton was still awarded half the delegates."
"I think Steph Curry should be our next president. Think about it. He plays for the Warriors. That's military experience. He's a job creator, because it takes three people to cover him. And he's ready to debate Donald Trump, because he already has plenty of experience slamming round, orange objects."

"Bernie Sanders beat out Hillary Clinton in last night's West Virginia Democratic primary. Said Hillary, 'That's still going on? Oh, man!'"

"Donald Trump said this morning that he will not be changing his tone as he gears up for the general election, and said, 'You win the pennant, and now you're in the World Series. You gonna change?'

"House Speaker Ryan did not endorse Trump or poke him with a stick or anything fun. Instead, they just released a joint statement saying, they were 'totally committed to working together.' And when Donald Trump commits to something, he totally means it. Ask any of his wives."
"But there's a scandal looming for Trump. See, since the start of the campaign, Trump has been promising to release his tax returns, but he just announced that he may not do that until after the election. So far, the only glimpse of his taxes he's given us is this picture he tweeted out of a huge stack of documents. It's a huge stack. But to be fair, that stack looks a lot larger next to his tiny, tiny hands."
"Speaking of Trump, in a recent interview, he said that he's hoping to make the Republican national convention more fun by hiring some entertainment, which is confusing for a lot of people because they thought Donald Trump was the entertainment."
"Despite saying he was encouraged by his meeting with Donald Trump this morning, House Speaker Paul Ryan is still holding off endorsing the presumptive Republican nominee. Buddy, what are you waiting for? He's your party's nominee. You're like a guy who hasn't deleted his Tinder account, even though his girlfriend moved in three months ago. It's over, dude! Find something on Netflix and hold his hand, cause it's over."

Trump was like, 'For the last time, it's not a pelt, it's my hair, okay.'"
"The big Trump news today is this audiotape that resurfaced from 1991 where Donald Trump apparently posed as his own publicist during a phone call. During a phone call to 'People' magazine. People are saying it's definitely him, he's saying it's not. Hillary Clinton was like, 'Isn't it annoying when people dig up stuff from the '90s and use it against you?'"
"It's the big 'New York Times' expos? on Donald Trump that reveals what they fear is some pretty questionable interactions with women. Including claims that when Trump ran the Miss USA pageant, he would frequently rate women's appearances right to their faces while they just stood there. Which is really sexist. And also pretty much the definition of any beauty pageant."
"The article makes the point that Donald Trump's hired many women to run his businesses and even quotes him as saying, 'A good woman is better than ten good men.' And Hillary was like, 'Thanks for the new campaign slogan.'"

"Audio has surfaced showing that in the 1980s and '90s, Donald Trump may have used a fake name to pose as his own publicist. Or maybe a little-known publicist named John Miller used a fake name to pose as a New York real estate mogul and run for president."

"Experts are suggesting that Donald Trump's base of support may be much greater than polls are reporting, because some voters may be reluctant to admit to pollsters that they agree with Trump's ideas.

"Shark Tank' star Mark Cuban said in an interview yesterday that he would vote for Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump, saying, 'The devil you know is better than the devil you don't know.' Or more accurately, 'The devil you know is better than, you know, the devil.'"
"Following the revelation that Donald Trump has used the alias John Miller to pose as his own publicist in the early '90s, a new report has surfaced showing that Trump also used the name Donald Baron as far back as 1980. How is anyone so lazy they can only be bothered to change half their name when going undercover? Unless he didn't decide that until halfway through that he wanted to do it."
"Melania Trump has given an exclusive interview to 'DuJour' magazine, in which she shot down accusations that she avoids the public eye, saying, 'I'm not shy, I know what I want.' And if it's anything like Trump's previous wives, I'm guessing half of everything."
"Any of you see the big Megyn Kelly-Donald Trump prime-time interview on Fox last night? Not too many people did. Out of five networks, it came in fifth. But the important thing is that wounds have been healed, which is good. I'm glad they patched things up. It was difficult to watch Donald and Megyn fight. It's hard to watch a fight between two people with such similar hair styles."

"Despite Bernie's win last night, Hillary only needs 90 more delegates to clinch the nomination, whereas Bernie needs more than 800 more delegates. So if you do the arithmetic, you don't work for the Sanders campaign."
"At his California rally last night, [Bernie Sanders] drew over 20,000 people. He's the only candidate who can fill a baseball stadium. I mean, even baseball can't fill a baseball stadium."
"Hillary followers think he should drop out, and the Bernie people feel they should stay in there for own beliefs, and things are getting tense out there. Angry Bernie supporters shut down last Saturday's Nevada state Democratic convention. They felt he was robbed of two delegates and his followers starting chanting 'recount,' and throwing chairs. Or as they put it, 'Redistributing the chairs equally to everyone's skulls.'"
"We had a couple more Democratic primaries yesterday, including one in Kentucky. And get this - before the media could even project the winner, Hillary Clinton went on Twitter and claimed victory. People said, 'Secretary Clinton, isn't that a bit premature?' And she said, 'Please, call me President Clinton.'"
"But the big story is Trump's prime-time interview with Megyn Kelly last night. The two of them seemed to bury the hatchet, and Megyn Kelly even gave Trump her cell phone number in case he ever wanted to chat. Although later, when Trump tried to call it, a guy picked up and said, 'Domino's.'"

To which Trump said, 'Somebody give me a watermelon. We're gonna win this thing.'"
"Yesterday, Trump did something prematurely presidential. He revealed which judges he would consider putting on the Supreme Court. ? And one of the picks - after Trump named him one of his finalists - they went back through the guy's account, found out he has a history of bashing Donald Trump on Twitter. Texas Supreme Court Justice Don Willett. ? Now I'm guessing Donald Trump may rethink that particular pick. But shouldn't being on Twitter in the first place disqualify you from consideration for the Supreme Court? I mean, we should nominate Kim Kardashian if that was the case."
"Bernie Sanders is showing no signs of giving in to Hillary Clinton even though she leads him by a lot in the delegate count. He wants to debate her here in California. His supporters are wreaking havoc at events, and I have to believe that Hillary, at this point, is thinking to herself, 'When is this old man going to die already? Thanks for nothing, Obamacare.'"
"The road's a little rough for [Hillary Clinton] right now. She needs all the help she can get. Just not the kind of help she's getting from former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, who tried to help by attacking her opponent, saying, 'Trump's comments like, 'You can't be a 10, if you're flat-chested,' will come back to haunt him.' And then Rendell helpfully added, 'There are probably more ugly women in America than attractive women. People take that stuff personally.' Yep, I have a feeling a lot of women are about to take that really personally."
"Rendell is way out of line. America is filled with beautiful women, especially after President Trump launches 'Operation Uggos to Gitmo'. 'SEAL Team Six? Ugh. Give me SEAL Team Ten.'"
"The 'New York Times' just did a big profile on Donald Trump and revealed that he has life-sized portraits of Ronald Reagan and John Wayne at his campaign headquarters. And if you don't see them right away, it's because they're right behind a 25-foot tall portrait of Donald Trump."

While the rest of the world is like, 'Yeah, and we're loving this. It's unbelievable. You can't write this. Canada, pass the popcorn.'"
"This election keeps changing. In fact, one of Trump's supporters just said Trump may not actually build a real wall. He said it might be just a metaphor for tighter immigration laws. Of course, Trump said he doesn't waste time with metaphors, then reminded everyone that his hands are very, very big."

The NRA on Friday endorsed Donald Trump for president. I guess that reaffirms their commitment to absolutely zero background checks.
"The latest numbers show Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are the most unpopular likely nominees in the history of NBC and 'Wall Street Journal' polling.

A third-party candidate is a little bit like a Tinder date. You think to yourself, 'What have I got to lose? Can't be worse than my ex.' Then you get to the restaurant and they're sitting there in one of those western-style fringe jackets, talking about how we shouldn't have to pay taxes and weed should be legal because the Founding Fathers smoked weed, and you can't help but stop staring at their lazy eye."
"Now Donald Trump just tweeted that a Hillary Clinton presidency would be 'four more years of stupidity.' As opposed to a Trump presidency, which would be one year of stupidity followed by three years of war with Mexico."
"Hillary Clinton, by the way, has a new campaign slogan. Hillary Clinton's new campaign slogan is 'Stronger Together.' This replaces her old slogan, 'Dammit, it's my turn.'"
"We have some very big-name guests, including Donald Trump on Wednesday and Bernie Sanders on Thursday. By Friday morning, I could be the presumptive vice president for both major parties."
"Polls also show that Trump and Clinton are the two most unpopular likely presidential nominees in the history of the poll. At this point, any third candidate would be more likeable than these two. We could be looking at President Bedbug-With-a-Manbun."
"So, Clinton and Trump are already attacking each other, which is going to make things really awkward when she attends his next wedding."
"Bernie Sanders is still hanging in there. Actually, I notice that Bernie has been wearing a lot of hats at his rallies the past couple days. When asked about it, Bernie said he just got tired of keeping his hair perfect 24/7."
"Speaking of his hair, Bernie said yesterday that his critics call him Santa Claus because of his white hair. And Santa said, 'Yeah, even I don't promise people that much free stuff.'"
"I saw that today, Donald Trump held a big rally in New Mexico. Which is weird because he spent his whole campaign promising to ban new Mexicans."
"Meanwhile, Trump criticized Hillary Clinton over the weekend, claiming that her views are just words read off a teleprompter. Hillary denied it saying, 'I've had these speeches memorized since I was six.'"
"Donald Trump is now ahead of Hillary Clinton in the polls. ... This was reported today in 'The Washington Post' and 2,000 years ago in the 'Book of Revelation.'"
"Donald Trump is holding his first-ever campaign fundraiser, but he says he's only doing it because the Republican Party asked him to. Trump thought he should do this for the Republican Party, since he turned down their first request, 'Don't be our candidate.'"
"Not all good news for Donald Trump. A recent survey found that Donald Trump is polling very badly among Asian-Americans. After hearing this, Trump said, 'That's odd, I haven't even gotten around to insulting them yet. I got great material on them.'"
"Troubling news for Hillary Clinton. I don't know if you heard this, but the FBI says, as part of its investigation of Hillary Clinton's emails, it may call her in to speak to them. No word yet on how much Hillary is planning to charge. Could be as much as three grand."
Bernie Sanders today campaigned in California just a few miles from Disneyland. Either that or Grumpy was on a lunch break.
"In an interview last night, Bernie Sanders talked about the chaotic primary season, saying 'democracy is messy.' Which is exactly the kind of comment you'd expect from a guy who always looks like he just rolled down a hill."
President Obama yesterday hit his highest approval rating since January 2013. It's what college girls have always known - how hot you are depends on who else is at the party.
"A televangelist who supports Donald Trump is claiming that Trump often displays his deep faith in God by pointing his finger up when gesturing during speeches, though really he's just saying how many of his kids he loves. 'Ivanka.'"
"Something I need to ask Donald Trump about. He said he would be willing to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, which is crazy, but he doesn't want to meet with Donald Trump. A Spokesman for North Korea dismissed the proposal as, quote, 'propaganda' for Trump's election campaign and said it has no meaning and sincerity. I never thought I'd agree with North Korea."
"Trump is in town for a fundraising dinner where tickets start at $25,000 a plate. And if you want food on the plate, it's another $30."
"Trump is fresh off of winning the primary in Washington state last night. When it was all added up, he got 76 percent of the vote. Ted Cruz got 10 percent and Kasich got 9.8 percent, which, somehow, Kasich is doing better since he dropped out than when he was in it."
Donald Trump is now within 28 delegates of clinching the Republican nomination. He's so close he can smell it like a discontinued Trump steak sizzling on the grill.
"The Trump campaign is about to launch a secret plan to attack Hillary Clinton over the Whitewater scandal from the '90s, and we know he's going to do this because they accidentally emailed the secret plan to a reporter, which means that, shockingly, Hillary Clinton might be the candidate with the second worst using of email."
"Speaking of which, this morning the State Department finally released their report on [Hillary Clinton's] use of a private email server. They found that she did not ask permission, and if she had, the answer would have been 'no,' which is one of the top reasons to not ask permission, by the way. ? And even when you do give Hillary Clinton a clear 'no,' what she hears is, 'Try again in eight years.'"
"The report did not state whether or not it was illegal, but it criticizes the last five secretaries of state for doing the same thing. So here's the deal. If you thought Hillary Clinton was corrupt, you just had all of your suspicions validated. And if you thought this whole thing was no big deal, you just had all of your suspicions validated."
"A new State Department audit has found that Hillary Clinton broke official rules by not turning over her email records quick enough. You know, between Hillary's emails and Trump's Twitter issues, maybe America is ready for a landline president."

Dogs came in. Everyone had to leave. I've had so many pat-downs this week, one of the Secret Service guys told me to get checked because he felt a lump."
"Bernie Sanders needs a big win in the California primary. Right now, he and Hillary Clinton are in a dead heat, which is not great because older people sometimes die in the heat."
"It would be pretty crazy if [Bernie Sanders] somehow wins this thing. On his first day in office, I imagine - my vision of Bernie Sanders on day one - is him stacking up all of the money on Wall Street and burning it like the Joker in 'The Dark Knight'."
"The Department of Defense is using computers from the '70s for the system they use to authenticate the launch of nuclear weapons. If anything went wrong, we'd have to call in Matthew Broderick. And if he's in the middle of a Broadway show, who knows how long it will take? So this could explain why Hillary Clinton set up her own email server."
"Today, Donald Trump received his 1,237th delegate, clinching the Republican nomination. And saying that just clenched a few sphincters."
"A year ago, it seemed impossible. But it just goes to show, if you put your mind to something and work really hard - you'll still probably lose to Donald Trump."
"Hillary Clinton has said she absolutely will not be debating Bernie Sanders anymore. So, today Trump announced that he will debate Bernie Sanders. That's right. Two angry New Yorkers shouting at each other. It'll be like the whole country is trapped in a subway car."
"Immediately after Trump offered to debate him, Bernie responded by tweeting, 'Game on.' Sounds like he's accepting, but he is an old guy, so he might have just been trying to tell the computer to open solitaire."
"After Hillary Clinton declined to debate Bernie Sanders this month, there's now talk that Bernie might debate Donald Trump. No word on what the debate will be on, but I'm guessing mute."
"At a campaign stop in New Mexico yesterday, Bill Clinton argued with a Bernie Sanders supporter for 30 minutes about issues from the '90s. It got heated, especially when Bill tried to claim that 'Step By Step' was better than 'Family Matters.'"

"Bernie Sanders asked why people didn't want to sit next with him, and they said, 'Well, we don't want to be in coach.'"
"It's being reported that the Obama family is planning to move into a nine-bedroom mansion in Washington, DC, after the President leaves office. ... I guess he wants to be close enough to drive by the White House every morning and shout, 'Sucks, doesn't it?'"

"USA Today' has put out a power rankings list of likely running mates for Donald Trump, with Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, former speaker Newt Gingrich, and Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst taking the top spots. 'Maybe the rest of the article is on another page,' said Chris Christie."
"Donald Trump got a big endorsement from the North Korean state media. They praised him for being a, quote, 'wise politician' and said Hillary Clinton is dull. So, that's a nice feather in his cap. Of course, North Korea endorsed Donald Trump. They want at least one other country to have a leader with a worse haircut than theirs."
"Things are heating up between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. ? She made a speech in San Diego calling Trump 'temperamentally unfit' for office. She said his policies are 'dangerously incoherent.' ? He fired back with a storm of angry tweets. Here are some of them. 'Crooked Hillary Clinton, who I would love to call Lying Hillary, is getting ready to misrepresent any foreign policy positions. Crooked Hillary no longer has credibility - too much failure in office. People will not allow another four years of incompetence. Bad performance by Crooked Hillary Clinton. Reading poorly from the teleprompter. She doesn't even look presidential.' It is going to be so much fun when they debate each other. It's going to be like a paternity episode of the 'Maury Povich Show.'"
"According to a new article from 'USA Today,' Donald Trump has been involved in a minimum of 3,500 lawsuits over the past 30 years, which is far more than any presidential candidate ever. It might be more than any lawyer ever, actually. I did the math - 3,500 lawsuits over 30 years comes to about one lawsuit every three days, and that's just from ex-wives."
"Trump, of course, has a positive spin for this, too. He says, 'Wow, USA Today did today's cover story on my record in lawsuits. Verdict:450 wins, 38 losses. Isn't that what you want for your president?' Maybe we could have a president who isn't suing people all of the time."
"He filed 1,900 of these lawsuits himself, which, on one hand, seems like an abuse of the legal system. On the other hand, unlike his clothing line, it is nice to see some Trump suits are made in the United States of America."
"[Referring to the Stanley Cup Championship Series] I saw that before tonight's game, members of Metallica performed 'The Star Spangled Banner.' Hockey and Metallica. Even Donald Trump was like, 'That's too white.'"

"After weeks of hesitation, House Speaker Paul Ryan finally endorsed Donald Trump for president on Thursday. When asked what influenced his decision, Ryan said, 'Xanax.'"
"Trump created even more controversy recently by claiming the judge presiding over his Trump University lawsuit is biased, and said he should be disqualified because of his Mexican heritage. When asked if his attacks would hurt his standing with Hispanic voters, Trump was like, 'Good point, Hispanics should be disqualified from voting, too.'"
"That's right, Trump claims that a judge of Mexican descent is biased against him. And he even went on to say a Muslim would treat him unfairly as well. Trump said the only fair way to judge anyone is to hold a swimsuit contest."
"According to a new poll, a majority of Americans say they would not sleep with Donald Trump for $1 million. Well, of course - nobody sleeps with him for $1 million."
"Donald Trump is continuing to draw criticism for his claims that Judge Gonzalo Curiel's Mexican heritage makes him unfit to preside over a lawsuit against Trump University, despite the fact that Curiel was born and raised in Indiana. And when Trump found that out, he said, 'Oh, no - he's an Indian, too?'"
"In an interview on Friday, CNN's Jake tapper asked Donald Trump the same question 23 times after feeling he was continually dodging it. The question was, 'What are your sons' names?'"

"While campaigning in California ahead of tomorrow's primary, Bernie Sanders yesterday stopped at a Los Angeles bar popular among the LGBT community. Said Sanders, 'No! I said I wanted a BLT!'"
"So there's been a lot of talk about Trump and lawsuits recently. Even Trump tweeted this on Thursday, 'Wow, 'USA Today' did today's cover story on my record in lawsuits. Verdict, 450 wins, 38 losses. Isn't that what you want for your President?' I got to be honest, I don't know if I do want a president with 488 lawsuits, because that's the number sticking in my head, not your win/loss record. If someone said, 'I've been on Maury Povich 55 times, but I've only been the father twice...,' I wonder about the 55."
"Tomorrow is the California primary. Analysts say it's make-or-break for Bernie Sanders. Make-or-break for Bernie Sanders. That's right, either Bernie wins and he keeps going, or he loses and he keeps going."
"[Donald Trump] is presently being sued over his fake college, Trump University. His mascot is so offensive, we can't even show it. It's just two orange balls. Because, folks, he's got a swingin' pair of 'em."
"[Referring to Donald Trump's charge that the judge overseeing a suit against Trump University is biased due to being of Mexican heritage] Trump's point is, he cannot be judged by a member of any group he's offended. So that means no Mexican judges, no Muslim judges, no Asian judges, no women judges, unless she's a '10.' Trump's insulted the Pope, so no Catholic judges. He called everyone in Iowa 'stupid,' so no judges that eat corn. You know what? Maybe Trump might be more comfortable if he couldn't tell the judge's race or gender. Maybe cover the judge up in an unbiased robe. Make it white. Maybe with a matching hood. That seems right."
It's being reported that Hillary Clinton now has enough delegates to secure the Democratic nomination. Hillary was so excited when she found out she asked her staff to schedule 15 seconds of smiling.
"That's right, Hillary Clinton has apparently earned enough delegates to clinch the nomination. Hillary told her assistant to break out the champagne. And he said, 'Actually, you drank it all when Trump secured his nomination. Do you remember that?'"
"Of course, Hillary had to reach the threshold of 2,383 delegates to become the presumptive nominee. Hillary hasn't been this excited about a threshold since the one she carried Bill over on their wedding night."
"Today, a lot of Republicans are turning on Donald Trump over his remarks about a Hispanic judge. ... House Speaker Paul Ryan described Donald Trump's remarks about a Hispanic judge as 'a textbook definition of racism.' When they heard this, Trump supporters said, 'You lost us at textbook.'"
"Today, presidential primaries are being held in California, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota and South Dakota. Or as it's being reported in the media, 'California.'"
"Some good news for Hillary Clinton. ... Yesterday, 'Forbes' magazine named Hillary Clinton the world's second most powerful woman. And number one? The lady who tried on the Chewbacca mask."

"The Associated Press' reported yesterday that Hillary Clinton is now the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, making her the first woman to be nominated for president by a major US party. And today, President Obama marked the occasion by saying, 'Not yet, Hillary.'"
"Hillary Clinton shot down the AP report calling her the Democratic nominee and said while she is flattered, she needed to focus on today's races. Really? That's like if you got love notes from a girl in your class for all four years of high school and then you ask her to senior prom and she goes, 'Well, what day is prom?'"
"According to a new report, several million bees have gone missing this year in California. So maybe Bernie does have one more trick up his sleeve. 'Attack, bees!' Bernie's bees."

"Last night, every major news outlet declared that Hillary Clinton had clinched the nomination, making her the first woman in US history to become a major party candidate for president. It sends a powerful message to all women that if you just work hard, someday you, too, can be vilified as an unlikable, Machiavellian crone."
"So, it looks like the general election will come down to Hillary Clinton versus Donald Trump. Which is fitting, really, since she'll be the first, you know, female nominee of her party, and he'll be his party's last nominee."
"The Clinton folks aren't happy about the media jumping the gun on her clinching it. She wanted to announce that at her victory rally tonight. So when she does announce, everyone please act like you didn't see this coming, okay."
"On the eve of Hillary's historic achievement, a vintage recording has surfaced of her 1969 commencement speech to her fellow graduates at Wellesley College. Her classmates that year voted and chose Clinton to give the speech, although Bernie Sanders insists, 'This isn't over. I still have a path to giving that speech. I'm building a time machine, and I promise there will be a contested commencement.'"
You know who could really use some ghost busters right now? Hillary Clinton. She's still being haunted by a spooky old ghost named Bernie.
"Hillary won four states yesterday. She clenched the party nomination. She's the first female nominee for a major party ever, which is historic. She now has a chance to become the second most powerful woman in the world, just behind Beyonc?."
"But even though Hillary has more votes, she's got more delegates, she's got more superdelegates, she won more states, Bernie Sanders still isn't giving up. He says he will continue to fight. He's like one of those old Japanese guys on an island who thinks the war is still going on."
"He says he's taking this to the Democratic convention in Philadelphia. He'll take it to the campaign in November, maybe even December if he has to, and I don't blame him. I mean, seriously. He's a 74-year-old man. Six months ago nobody cared. Now he gets worshiped like a prophet everywhere he goes. What do you think he's going to do? Go back to Vermont? No. He's staying in this race until he drops dead."
"The Clinton campaign celebrated her historic achievement in a manner befitting its gravity with this tweet, 'Thanks to you, we made history tonight. Celebrate with a free magnet!' Yes, a big, round magnet, perfect to decorate your car bumper, or maybe even erase your emails."
"So Bernie's not looking good, but Bernie still stands. It reminds me of that movie. What was it called? It was about an older man who's dead but no one can tell because he's propped up by enthusiastic young people. It's 'Weekend at [Bernie's].'"
"Of course, like all nights, last night was also a big one for Donald Trump, who destroyed his competition in every state where he had no competition."
"And last night, [Trump] shocked the world when he gave his victory speech using a teleprompter. A teleprompter. This from a guy who got this far by shouting whatever comes into his head. Trump using a teleprompter is like the Flash calling an Uber, Aquaman taking a ferry, or Bernie Sanders using a comb."
"The big story is that last night Hillary Clinton earned enough delegates to be the Democratic nominee, making her the first woman to secure a major party's nomination. She gave a moving speech afterwards and told the crowd, 'Tonight belongs to all of you.' Then Bernie Sanders was like, 'Oh, so now she's a socialist.'"
"Bernie Sanders has still not conceded the race, and said there's actually a chance he could end up being the nominee. Unfortunately for Bernie, that chance involves a DeLorean and a flux capacitor."
"Over on the Republican side, Donald Trump gave a big speech last night where he said that he understands the responsibility of carrying the Republican mantle and said that he will never, ever let you down. Then he was like, 'Starting now.'"
"Meanwhile, some senior aides working with Donald Trump told NBC News that his campaign is actually severely understaffed and very disorganized. Even crazier, most of Trump's speeches are written by throwing poetry magnets at a fridge."
"Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have both clinched the nomination for their respective parties, which means we could be looking at our first female president or our last president."
"Hillary Clinton told supporters last night that her status as the Democratic nominee is thanks to the generations who struggled and sacrificed before her. 'You're welcome,' said Bernie Sanders."
"Despite Hillary Clinton clinching the Democratic nomination, Bernie Sanders vowed to stay in the race and told supporters in Los Angeles that the struggle continues. The struggle to understand math?"
"In a prepared speech last night, Donald Trump told supporters he is going to take care of our African-American people. Though, I don't think he should have added 'once and for all.'"
"When asked in a new interview if he thinks Donald Trump is racist, House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters, 'I don't know what's in Trump's heart.' Well, if I had to guess, I'd say cholesterol and racism."
"Hillary Clinton now looks like she's going to be going head-to-head with Donald Trump. ? In the general election, Donald Trump plans on painting Hillary Clinton as money-grubbing and unethical. ... Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton plans on painting Donald Trump as Donald Trump."
Bernie Sanders is vowing to stay in the race until the Democratic convention. ... He says he owes it to all his supporters who need something to do until Burning Man.
"Bernie Sanders is planning on cutting half of his campaign staff. Bernie said, 'I'm saving money by only keeping the most delusional.'"
"Referring to Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump now being their respective parties' presumptive nominees] So now the big question is, who will they pick as their running mates? A lot of people want Hillary to pick Elizabeth Warren. ... And Warren is already out there attacking Donald Trump. Just today she told a crowd, 'Donald Trump is a loud, nasty, thin-skinned fraud.' That is just wrong. There's no way that stuff covering his face is skin. Meanwhile, Trump says that he's narrowed his list of candidates down to four or five. Though, if it's a woman, she'll definitely be a ten."
"Bernie Sanders has refused to drop out. And today he had a private meeting in the White House with President Obama, which was fitting since they're both beloved political figures who are just a few months away from not being president."
"Nobody knows what will what happened in there, although, I assume, Obama did something to convince Bernie to drop out of the race. 'All right, Bernie, you can sit behind the desk, take a selfie, and now get out.'"
"After meeting with the President and checking under the White House doormat for a spare key, Bernie told reporters that he's willing to work with Hillary Clinton to fight a common enemy. They will work together. He will be right there with her the whole time, at every debate, standing in the wings, mouthing along with all her lines."
"After the endorsement, Trump tweeted, 'Obama just endorsed crooked Hillary. He wants four more years of Obama - but nobody else does!' Then Hillary immediately responded, 'Delete your account.' That's pretty strong! I tell ya, if he needs help deleting computer records, she knows a guy."
"But Bernie's showing no signs of ending his campaign. With only one primary left to go, Bernie has changed his slogan from - and this is true - 'Feel the Bern' to 'The Struggle Continues.' It's a great slogan. Clearly, he got it from a high-priced political consultant or read it off a can of prunes."
"[Referring to Trump's speech in which he reached out to Sanders' supporters] Yeah, Bernie supporters, Donald Trump welcomes you with open arms. If you can't have what you want, how about the exact opposite? It's like when they're all out of chocolate ice cream, so instead you get someone to call you fat and deport your family."
"Of course, it's stressful being President and not everyone's always happy with you. In fact, many members of Congress have stated they've felt [President Obama] had been aloof or distant with them, and complained that he didn't spend enough time with them. Here's my question:If you're best friends with Jay Z and Beyonc?, would you waste time hanging out with members of Congress?"
"Actually, the President, he has a lot going on as he wraps up his term in office, including the construction of his official presidential library, which will be built in Chicago. It will be a place devoted entirely to Obama and his achievements, or as that's also known, 'MSNBC.'"
"Actually, so much has happened during President Obama's Administration. Obamacare was passed. Same-sex marriage was legalized. He worked with 11 other countries to sign the historic Trans-Pacific Partnership. Whereas Donald Trump just walked around Epcot and insulted every country."
"The co-founder of Home Depot recently announced that he is supporting Donald Trump. He wasn't planning to, but when your colors are orange and white, you kind of have to go with Donald."

"Bernie Sanders met with President Obama today to discuss the status of the Democratic race, and afterwards, Obama drove him out to the country and opened the car door. 'Go on now. You're free!'"
"Experts are saying that President Obama's meeting with Bernie Sanders this morning may help the chance of unity within the Democratic Party, because Obama and Sanders have both campaigned against Hillary Clinton. Poor Hillary. Obama and Sanders meeting is like when two of your exes go get brunch. You want to believe they're gonna discuss life and work and current events, but in your heart you know they're just going to drink mimosas and talk [crap]."
"Donald Trump's campaign staff is reportedly worried that Trump will suddenly announce his vice presidential pick online without consulting with his advisers. Said Trump, 'Well, it's not like I can just call him.'"
"Hillary Clinton got a huge boost for her campaign...when President Obama released a video message endorsing her for President. He said he reached the decision entirely on his own, but the video was filmed in Hillary's basement and began with Obama holding up that day's newspaper."
The video of Obama endorsing Hillary already has thousands of views online. Seventeen if you don't count Hillary.
Obama actually endorsed Hillary just hours after he met with Bernie Sanders at the White House. We should have known Bernie was in trouble when he left the White House without a rose.

"I saw that Donald Trump celebrated his 70th birthday today. I guess instead of blowing out his candles, he just insulted them until they put themselves out."
"Actually, since it's Donald Trump's birthday, we thought it would be nice to go over some of his greatest accomplishments up until now. First in 1946, Donald Trump was born. In 1949, used blocks to build wall. Made nanny pay for it."
"President Obama gave a speech this afternoon in which he angrily called out Republicans for being too obsessed with his refusal to use the term 'radical Islam.' Or as Fox News reported it, angry black man spotted talking about radical Islam near capitol building."
A new poll found that Donald Trump's lead among men and white voters shrunk recently. He's going to have to make up the difference with women and minorities.
Happy birthday to Donald Trump who turns 70 years old today. And this is cool. So did his views on immigration.
"Today was Donald Trump's 70th birthday which means that his Facebook wall was full of birthday wishes from friends and family...Bernie posted, 'How am I only four years older than you?'"

Bernie Sanders is set to meet with Hillary Clinton this evening. Bernie said the meeting will give Hillary one last opportunity to bow out gracefully.
"According to a new report, Donald Trump uses Chris Christie as a manservant to fetch his McDonald's. I just want to address Chris Christie directly for one second. Listen, Chris You might think fetching Mickey D's for Trump is a good idea. You prove you're loyal, then when Trump is elected, he'll make you ambassador to McDonald but you deserve better. Remember, Chris, there are people out there who love you. Not in New Jersey, but somewhere, surely."
You know who could use Ghostbusters right now? Hillary Clinton. She's still being haunted by a spooky ghost named Bernie.
"I'm going to tell you something, the system is rigged against me. By the superdelegates and the fat cats and the one percent and the Kardashians. They're all in this, it's a conspiracy. They don't want me to be your Vice President. They want me to go away and curl up in a ball and roll down a hill into a field to be kicked by men who don't speak English playing soccer. But guess what, when November comes, we'll see who's laughing when I'm smoking cigarettes and doing loops over the White House in Air Force Two."
"Last night, the last primary was held in Washington, DC. The primaries being over reminds me what my brother used to say when I was a kid, 'Ah, I'm going to keep punching you in the face but it will feel so good when it's over.'"
"Last night, Hillary Clinton beat Bernie Sanders by 57 points. Turns out running as a Washington insider really helps when you're running inside Washington."
"[On the Russian DNC hack] Hey, maybe the Russians know where Hillary's emails are."
"While they were in the DNC cyber matrix?the Russians apparently stole opposition research on Donald Trump. Russia, what are you doing? If you want damaging information about Donald Trump, just wait for him to talk."
"The British are about to vote on whether to exit the European Union. They call it the Brexit, which, in America, of course, is the meal between breakfast and exiting breakfast."
"Right now in the polls, Brexiting has a seven-point lead over staying in the European Union. And it could be even bigger than it sounds because, remember, British polls are all in Celsius."
"This morning in Atlanta, Donald Trump - facing criticism that his campaign has become increasingly racist - received an endorsement from former presidential candidate Herman Cain. Now guys, sometimes things come back and it's wonderful, like the Ghostbusters or John Travolta. And other times the thing that comes back is Herman Cain."
"[Cain] was at the rally primarily to convince people that Donald Trump is not a racist. And he even said, quote, 'Donald Trump is not a racist.' And even if that's not true, it's never good when it needs to be said. Like, if you went on a first date and the person said, 'I'm not a serial killer,' my guess is there won't be a second date."
"Yesterday, Donald Trump turned 70. Or as Bernie Sanders calls it, the good ol' days."
"Obama's right, refusing the term 'radical Islam' hasn't made him soft on the Middle East. I mean, when it comes to terrorists, he's ruined more plots than an obnoxious coworker live-tweeting Game of Thrones."
"The economy is so bad, my TV remote has a menu button and a dollar-menu button."
"The latest polls show Hillary Clinton now leads Donald Trump by 12 points nationally. I guess she's getting some traction from her new slogan, 'Come With Me, If You Want To Live.'"
GOP Senator Tim Scott yesterday walked out of a press room and hid on the Senate floor to avoid questions about Donald Trump. That's how much senators don't want to talk about Trump:they're actually showing up in the Senate.
"Former Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain said in a speech today that he feels Donald Trump is not a racist. Said Trump, 'Thank you, Ben Carson.'"
"A new poll reveals that 70 percent of Americans have a negative view of Donald Trump. ... Hey, but Trump said don't worry, there's still plenty of time before the election to get that number even higher. He's going for 90."
"In Virginia recently, a computer crash wiped out a decade's worth of US military data. However, this morning, the Chinese government called and said, 'No problem, we backed it up.'"
"Donald Trump is on a warpath again. ? More than 20 pages of what they call opposition research - this is the dirt the parties dig up on their opponents to use against them - was stolen from the Democratic National Committee computer files and released to the media. The DNC blames Russian hackers for the leak, but Trump is accusing the DNC of leaking the information themselves, which doesn't make a lot of sense because this is information they planned to release anyway. Accusing another party of leaking opposition research is like accusing McDonald's of leaking McNuggets."
"Trump, though, said much of the information that has been leaked is false and if people want to read hundreds of pages of negative information about him, they should go to his Twitter page where he writes it himself."
"Trump is also playing defense right now in regard to his stance on North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Trump said he would - unlike previous presidents - sit down and meet with Kim Jong-un to make some kind of deal, but only on US soil. But I don't think that will work. I think they should meet, but somewhere neutral like at a Super Cuts."
"Over on the Democratic side, word on the street is that Hillary Clinton is not considering Bernie Sanders as a potential running mate, but Bernie is being vetted as the new spokesperson for Quaker Oats, so that's good."
Do you realize Bernie Sanders is still running? He's like the guy at the restaurant who finishes eating and then stays at the table and then the waiters have to flash the lights on and off.
"Trump and Hillary are really starting to go at it. In fact, today Trump took a swipe at Hillary and said that he isn't sure if she understands the difference between a wall and a fence. Yeah, it's getting nasty. Hillary was like, 'Yes, I do. A wall is something you want to build and a fence is the only thing keeping me from moving into the White House today.'"
"Yesterday former Republican candidate Herman Cain said that one of the biggest lies about Donald Trump is that he is a racist. Then Trump was, like, 'Thank you, Jay Z. Give my best to your wife, Oprah.'"
"One of Trump's big supporters, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, is having a rough week. Lawyers working on the 'Bridgegate' investigation claim that Chris Christie destroyed evidence connecting him to the scandal, including a cell phone. Christie said he had no idea where the cell phone was, then his stomach started ringing."
"It's being reported that officials have recently approved a higher fence for the White House. When asked how tall they wanted it, Hillary said, 'um, 5'8? 5'9? I don't know [referring to Sen. Bernie Sanders height].'"
Today is the one year anniversary of Donald Trump's announcement that he would run for President. It's hard to believe it was only one year ago that Democrats were worried about Jeb Bush.
"Donald Trump's campaign staff is reportedly worried that trump will suddenly announce his vice presidential pick online without consulting with his advisers. Said Trump, 'Well, it's not like I can just call him.'"
"Donald Trump says if elected, he is willing to accept a visit by Kim Jong-un. Yeah. Kim Jong-un said, 'No thanks. That guy is crazy.'"
"A Republican senator from Illinois said he won't support Donald Trump for President because he's too racist. He said, 'That's why I liked Ted Cruz. He was just racist enough. Just perfect.'"

"I wanna say congrats to Chelsea Clinton, who welcomed her second child over the weekend. After the birth, Bill brought flowers, while Hillary brought a focus group to help name the baby."
"Speaking of Hillary, I saw that she just received an endorsement from the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers, and Grain Millers Union. Even 'The Village People' are like, 'What a weird combination of jobs."
"The big political story today is that Donald Trump fired his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski. Trump said Lewandowski was controversial, impulsive, and short tempered. And will make a great running mate."
"Big change in the Donald Trump campaign. He has dumped his campaign manager, Cory Lewandowski. He said he was going to return to his old job as a manager in pro wrestling."
"At a campaign rally this weekend, Donald Trump said he felt like a supermodel. Then out of habit, Trump tried to marry himself."
"Here's a crazy thing about Bernie Sanders. Even though he has no chance of winning the nomination, taxpayers are still paying for Bernie Sanders to have Secret Service. It's not that expensive, though. It's just one guy, who goes out late at night to buy Fig Newtons when Bernie is at home."
"A new poll came out and claims 25 percent of voters remain undecided. Yeah, probably undecided on whether to move to Canada or Mexico."
"The Cleveland Cavaliers beat the Golden State Warriors last night and became the first NBA team to ever come back from a 3-1 deficit to win the championship. Said Bernie Sanders, 'So you're saying there's a chance!'"
"Donald Trump this morning fired his controversial campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski. I think his name was half the problem. Corey is such a fireable name."
"Donald Trump thanked crowds in Phoenix for their support this weekend, saying, 'I feel like a supermodel, except like times ten.' By the way, 'supermodel times ten' is also his spray-tan setting."
"Despite Hillary Clinton clinching the Democratic nomination, Bernie Sanders is still getting protection from a full Secret Service detail costing taxpayers $38,000 per day. Replied Sanders, 'Relax. I have a Groupon.'"
"Chelsea Clinton gave birth to a son this weekend. Unfortunately, due to his young age, he's a Sanders supporter."
"Representatives of Bush-era Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said this weekend that she is not interested in being Donald Trump's running mate. Said Trump, 'That's too bad. I love Condoleezza Rice and all Mexican food, really. I love Hispanics.'"
"Next month, the Republican convention comes to town headlined by Donald Trump, and there was some big news out of the Trump campaign today. This afternoon he fired his campaign manager, which came as a big surprise, especially to the campaign manager, who did not know it was coming. It took place at a staff meeting this morning. Apparently, Trump asked Meat Loaf who would you fire, and Meat Loaf said that guy, and that was it."
"Things do not seem to be going well lately for the Trump campaign. This weekend they sent out what they called an emergency fundraising email claiming they needed to raise $100,000 quickly. I was wondering when they would finally get to the Nigerian-prince-in-desperate-need-of-your-help campaign."
"Some surprising news about the Donald Trump campaign today. A new election commission report just came out saying that the Trump campaign isn't doing so well financially and is practically broke. It's not good. I mean, in fact today, Trump stole a bunch of towels from his own hotel."
"The report revealed that Donald Trump's campaign started this month with only $1.3 million, which is almost $8 million less than Bernie Sanders' campaign."
"Of course, there's also people who want to try to stop Hillary Clinton from being president. In fact, I read up to eight anti-Hillary films could be released in the coming months and some of the titles seem pretty familiar. First, there's, 'The Devil Wears Talbots.'"
I saw that this week President Obama will be attending the Global Entrepreneurship Summit in California. The only place to see more people describing themselves as entrepreneurs is on 'The Bachelorette.'
"Today, members of the conservative Christian clergy met with Donald Trump. They came out of the meeting proclaiming there is no God."
"Everyone's wondering who Hillary Clinton's running mate is going to be. That's the million dollar question right now. Hillary Clinton's short list for running mate includes Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Sen. Tim Kaine, and HUD Secretary Julian Castro. Donald Trump's short list includes anyone from the cast of 'Entourage.'"
Hundreds of demonstrators showed up in Times Square today to protest Donald Trump's meeting with evangelical leaders at a nearby hotel. That's how much those protesters hate Donald Trump - they're willing to go to Times Square.
"At a meeting with nearly 1,000 evangelical leaders today, Donald Trump told the attendees that Hillary Clinton is not worthy of their prayers. Although I'm pretty sure Hillary's prayers were already answered when Trump won the GOP nomination."
"A recent report found that 52 percent of voters think Hillary Clinton is more intelligent than Donald Trump, while the rest disagreed with that statement 'bigly.'"
"According to insiders, the key factor in yesterday's firing of Donald Trump's campaign manager was his attempt to trade information on Trump's vice presidential pick in exchange for positive news coverage about himself. Said Chris Christie, 'Well, that's crazy because Donald's not even having a vice president this year. He told me himself.'"
"Hillary Clinton gave a speech in Columbus, Ohio. She called Trump an uncaring businessman. Which I guess is supposed to be an insult, except those are the exact words he has printed on his business card. 'Donald Trump, uncaring businessman.'"
"About the speech, Clinton's senior advisor said if we were to put Trump behind the wheel of the American economy, he would drive us off a cliff. That's ridiculous. He's going to drive us into a wall, a nice beautiful wall paid for by Mexico."
Trump is entering the election at the worst disadvantage for any candidate ever. Clinton has $42 million in the bank and Trump has only $1.3 million. That's not enough to buy a degree at Trump University.
Hillary has about 700 staffers. Trump only has 70. And most of them are just there to stop him from tweeting in the middle of the night.
"Well, folks, the results are in, and the election is still going to be Hillary Clinton versus Donald Trump. It is the very first time in American history that both political parties have the same slogan:'2016:Look, it is what it is.'"
"Last night, the Federal Election Commission announced how much cash each campaign has on hand. And Hillary Clinton is burying Donald Trump - $42 million to $1.3 million. I can't believe Trump has so little cash. I always knew those huge skyscrapers were overcompensating for something in his pants. I just never imagined it was his wallet."
"Not only is the Trump campaign poorly funded, but it estimates it currently has about 30 people on staff across the entire country. Donald Trump would have more full-time staffers if he just hired Arcade Fire."
"Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton's campaign is growing. She's gaining new supporters as fast as Chelsea can crank them out."
"Donald Trump is getting ready. He's been stepping up his attacks on Hillary Clinton. He just launched a new website called LyingCrookedHillary.com, which I tried to go on like five times today. Every time all I got [was] a blank page. You know, I told them not to hire the guys who set up the Obamacare website."
"Donald Trump had a meeting with religious leaders, and he questioned both Hillary Clinton and President Obama's faith. As you know, Trump is very religious, very Christian. He likes his Testament the same way he likes his wives, new."
"But as for Hillary, Trump said he warned these guys, he said the public doesn't know anything about her in terms of her religion, whereas we do know that he is a man of deep faith. In fact, his faith is so deep you can barely see any sign of it. His faith is like one of these see-through fish at the very, very bottom of the ocean. You know, the ones that are invisible because no light ever touches their bodies. That's how deep Donald Trump's faith is. He's like a clean-shaven Jesus with beautiful hair."
"Hillary Clinton's campaign is getting a boost from her former rival, President Obama. Obama is giving her his email list. This is the list of donors that he used during his campaigns in 2008 and 2012. He's turning that all over to her. What a great idea. She's had amazing luck with emails in the past. This should work out perfectly."
"[Referring to House Democrats' Capitol Hill sit-in] Democrats are demanding a vote before the Fourth of July recess. And to send that message, they chanted 'No bill, no break!', almost drowning out the gun lobby, shouting, 'I'll make the check out to cash!'"
"Republicans are already responding. Rep. Tom Cole said, 'I don't think we should allow any group to bring the work of the House to a halt.' It's true. It's true. You wouldn't want the gridlock to lose its momentum."
"This morning, with his poll numbers dropping, [Donald Trump] gave a fiery speech that some are calling an attempt to reset his campaign. I mean, they had to reset it. They kept getting the message 'Error 404:Shame not found.'"
"Of course, things are really heating up between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. ... Hillary gave a speech yesterday attacking Trump, and then today, Trump gave a counter-speech attacking Hillary, which means 2016 will always be remembered as the election of 'Shut up.' 'No you shut up.'"
"Trump really went after Hillary Clinton today. In fact, he said that Hillary, quote, 'Gets rich by making you poor.' Then Hillary was like, 'You mean like owning a bunch of casinos?'"
"While he was back at the Capitol yesterday, Bernie Sanders accidentally went to the Republican lunchroom. Bernie knew he wasn't in the Democrats lunchroom when he couldn't get a free lunch."
"Donald Trump this morning called Hillary Clinton 'a world class liar.' He added, 'And I know that because I see her at all the meetings.'"
"Donald Trump gave a speech today on what he called the failed policies and bad judgment of Hillary Clinton. And he's right, her judgment isn't always great, but nobody will listen to him because his judgment is so much worse. It's like when you get pulled over for doing 45 in a 35 zone and just when the cop is writing a ticket, somebody else races by doing 110 and throwing bags of cocaine out the window. Every time, that cop is going to say, 'I gotta go, just be more careful, ma'am.'"
"Anti-Trump Republicans have reportedly been reenergized by reports that Donald Trump's campaign is having financial problems that could lead to an alternative GOP nominee. 'Awesome,' said Jeb Bush before slipping on a banana peel and falling into a manhole."
"Bernie Sanders today told reporters he's not sure if he will be asked to speak at the upcoming Democratic Convention, but he does know he won't be asked to speak up."
"A New York woman has reportedly filed a federal lawsuit against Donald Trump over claims that he assaulted a minor in the early 1990s. But in Donald's defense, Kevin McAllister should not have been [messing] around the plaza alone [referring to Trump's appearance in 'Home Alone 2:Lost in New York']."
"Ted Cruz today endorsed Marco Rubio's campaign for reelection in the Senate, and when those two work together, there's nothing they can do."
Bernie Sanders admitted today that he doesn't believe he can become the Democratic nominee. He also said it might be time to give up on his dream of qualifying for the X Games.
"In a speech today, Donald Trump blasted Hillary Clinton, calling her 'a world class liar' and 'the most corrupt person' to seek the presidency. Trump then said, 'Wait a second, I think I'm in love.'"
"In a new speech, Donald Trump said Hillary Clinton wants to move factories, quote, 'overseas to Mexico.' When told there's no sea between here and Mexico, Trump said, 'When I'm done with the environment, there will be.'"
"Today, Donald Trump called on Bernie Sanders' supporters to support him instead. Trump wants Bernie Sanders' supporters. Trump said, 'Ignore my policy positions, just focus on my New York accent and crazy hair. We have a lot in common here.'"
"The Washington Post' did a review of the Reagan Library archives. Donald Trump apparently has exaggerated his relationship with Ronald Reagan, which is very unlike him to exaggerate. But he said that he and Reagan liked each other and indicated that they knew each other. But the records show President Reagan repeatedly ignored his letters and invitations, and Ronald Reagan's son said his father 'would not have known Donald Trump if Trump stood up in his soup.' Which raises the question:What the [heck] kind of soup was Ronald Reagan eating?"
Have you guys been watching this sit-in in the House of Representatives? Pretty dramatic. It is so rare that Congress does anything interesting. ? So I want to take a moment to say something I never thought I would:'Thank you Congress for sitting on your [butt].'
"After the protest began, Paul Ryan declared a recess and cut off C-SPAN's live feed. Now, personally, I don't want to live in a world where Paul Ryan decides what's on TV. I'm guessing it would just be P90X infomercials and 'Top Gun' 24 hours a day."
"And some Republicans got really mad. In fact, on Twitter, North Carolina Congressman Mark Walker attacked John Lewis, tweeting, 'Calling this a sit-in is a disgrace to Woolworth's.' Keep in mind - John Lewis led Woolworth lunch counter sit-ins during the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s. And this guy's lecturing him on what is or is not a sit-in."
"Donald Trump has left the country. It's normal for a presidential candidate to go overseas to meet world leaders and brush up on foreign policy, which is why today Trump went to Scotland to promote a golf course. That's understandable. They have to model the clown's mouth off someone."
"Now, some people think this trip is an unnecessary distraction from the election. As one political strategist said, 'Everyone knows this is the wrong thing for the nominee to be doing now, and it is amazing this can't be stopped.' Then again, 'It is amazing this can't be stopped' is Trump's campaign slogan."
"Donald Trump is actually taking a break from the campaign to go visit his golf resort in Scotland tomorrow. Right after he leaves the US, Republicans will say, 'Quick! Build the wall!'"
"Actually, a big story this week is that Trump's campaign isn't doing so well financially. A recent report...said his campaign even spent over $100,000 for meals just last month. And Trump said, 'Well, that's the price you pay for hiring Chris Christie.'"
"Hillary Clinton gave a speech yesterday where she talked about employment. She said that not every job requires a four-year college degree. And this year's graduates said, 'This is the worst commencement speech ever! I'm finally graduating! Where were you last year?'"
"The other main story is that Democrats held a big sit-in on the House floor to protest Congress' refusal to vote on gun control. Or in other words, Democrats were tired of Congress not getting anything done, so they refused to get anything done until someone got something done."
"Democrats staged a 25-hour sit-in on the floor of the House to try to force a vote on new gun control legislation. You know the state of our Congress is terrible when you see a bunch of politicians sitting on their [butts] and think to yourself, 'Wow, their finally doing something.'"
"After ending their 25-hour sit-in, House Democrats vowed to continue fighting for gun control when Congress resumes in July, because it's going to take that long for some of these dudes to get up off the floor."
"Yesterday, House Speaker Paul Ryan referred to the Democratic-led sit-in for gun control as 'nothing more than a publicity stunt.' He then added, 'Now, if you'll excuse me, my party's nominee has a WWE match to fight.'"
There was a sit-in in Congress and the Republicans took it off C-SPAN and they started live-streaming it on Periscope. It was nuts. It was live-streamed and guess what? It got over three million views. Three million views! Amazing. Which is why today Congress got picked up for two seasons on Netflix
House Speaker Paul Ryan has unveiled a Republican alternative to Obamacare. It's called 'Dying At 50.'
"In response to Hillary Clinton's slogan, 'I'm with her,' Donald Trump unveiled his new slogan, 'I'm with you.' Yeah, that's true. Then Bernie Sanders debuted his new slogan, 'I'm still here, [darn] it.'"
"In it's the last few days before break, the Supreme Court has been arguing about race, integration, and abortion. So basically the Supreme Court has become most people's families at Thanksgiving."
"It's reported that after leaving office, President Obama is considering owning an NBA team. They say he wants to be an NBA owner because it's his only chance to get someone on the court."
"Last night, the UK officially voted to leave the European Union. I read that it caused the British pound to hit a 31-year low. You could tell Brits were struggling today. Queen Elizabeth was wearing one of those cardboard crowns from Burger King."
"Following the vote, British Prime Minister David Cameron actually resigned, saying that the country needs new leadership. An American said, 'Can you start here next January? We have an opening.'"
"I read that former London Mayor Boris Johnson is the favorite to replace David Cameron for prime minister. People have noticed that his hair is very similar to Donald Trump. Trump was like, 'It should look the same, it came from the same litter.'"
"Critics call those in Britain who voted to pull out of the European Union racist and anti-immigrant. After hearing this, Donald Trump said, 'Wow. I'm running for leader of the wrong country."

"Bernie Sanders is still in the race. Over the weekend, Bernie Sanders' press secretary left his campaign. Yeah. Bernie said, 'Now it's just me and my podiatrist.'"
"First, let's talk about something important:The 'Game of Thrones' finale. By which, of course, I mean the Republican National Convention. ... Because Politico called over 50 prominent Republicans, and it turns out, hardly anybody wants to speak at Trump's convention. Finally answering the old question, 'What if you destroyed a party and nobody came?'"
"[Referring to UK referendum] Well, you've had your little vote, and now the British economy is tanking. The pound has plunged to its lowest level since 1985. Right now, the most stable currency in the UK is the Cadbury Creme Egg."
"And it ain't just over there. Here in America on Friday, the Dow lost 611 and then almost 300 more today. ... It was so shocking, you could have knocked me over with what's left of your 401(k)."
"Of course, not all Brits are sitting around asking, 'What have we done?' Most of them Googled it. The search 'What happens if we leave the EU?' spiked by over 250 percent after polls closed. Which is kind of like Googling 'What happens after unprotected sex?' on your way to the baby shower."
"The investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails seems to never end. These emails are like 'Transformers' movies. Just when you get sick about hearing one, another batch comes out."
"Yesterday, 165 pages of emails from Clinton's time as Secretary of State were released. Turns out they're just as boring as the other 55,000 pages of emails. We aren't interested in reading Hillary Clinton's work emails. We want to read her emails with Bill. Those are the ones that interest us."
"[Referring to Donald Trump's criticism of Sen. Elizabeth Warren] Trump now likes to call Sen. Warren 'Pocahontas' and 'goofy.' He ran out of nicknames, so he's just using Disney characters now."
"[Referring to a Quinnipiac University poll on the Hillary Clinton-Donald Trump presidential race] Quinnipiac University poll, the new poll, has them almost tied. Hillary is up 42 to 40 percent over Trump, and the other 18 percent polled said they're going to kill themselves in November."
"With the margin of error, they're in a virtual tie, which is a big deal. This is the first tie for Donald Trump that wasn't manufactured in China."
"When you break the numbers down, Clinton got the support of 91 percent of black voters, while Trump took just one. Not one percent. Literally one black voter. His name is Leonard, don't call him Leon. Leonard."
"Among Hispanic voters, Clinton leads Trump 50 percent to 33 percent, which surprised me. After all the things he's said, you'd think he'd have more support from African-Americans than Mexican-Americans. But then you remember, you know, if you cross the border to move to another country, there's a good chance that one of the reasons you did that is to get away from your family back home."
"I'll tell you something, when I'm vice president, there won't be any emails to read, because I will communicate exclusively through Snapchat."
It is really hard to believe that there are only seven months left in the Obama presidency. You never know how much you're going to miss a guy until you see the options.
"A lot of people are wondering what Barack Obama will do after he's president. There's a lot of speculation. And today, I read today that he is thinking about becoming a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley. Obama's a perfect fit for Silicon Valley. He's a nerd who got way more powerful than anyone in high school ever imagined."
"Now, compare Obama's post-presidential plans to Jimmy Carter, who famously took a low-paying construction job. I can't believe they're still making that man work. He's 91 years old! Let him retire, poor people. Sub-Saharan Africa is so selfish."

"Trump might be getting a boost in the polls pretty soon, because sources say Donald Trump is vetting Chris Christie as a potential running mate. Christie would definitely help Trump win voters in New Jersey, who are anxious to get rid of Chris Christie."
"The source claims Christie has begun the official vetting process, which in this case means trying to sell more lemonade in Times Square than Gary Busey."

"Over on the Republican side, [Donald] Trump is having a bit of a hard time finding someone even willing to be his running mate. But one name that keeps coming up as a possibility is Newt Gingrich. He might be a good fit for the job. I mean, his resume is pretty impressive. He was a congressman for 20 years, serving Georgia from 1979 until 1999. He served as Speaker of the House from 1995 to 1999. His favorite cookie is Keebler's fudge stripe."
"Bernie Sanders is expected to actually endorse Hillary Clinton at an event in New Hampshire tomorrow. In fact, Bernie is set to give his most enthusiastic endorsement of all time:'Eh.'"

"People are still hammering the Clintons about their past. In fact, 'The LA Times' just revealed that Bill Clinton has demanded private jets to get to speaking engagements. In their defense, Bill and Hillary need private jets, because they're the only planes that can fit all of their baggage."
"The Washington Times' now reporting that Indiana Gov. Mike Pence has a 95 percent chance of being Donald Trump's pick for vice president. I'm not saying Chris Christie's upset, but he was last seen at the top of the Empire State Building swatting at planes."
"Yesterday Trump actually said that his vice presidential running mate won't matter, because that person never really winds up helping a candidate any way. You know he's going to use those exact same words when introducing his running mate at the convention. He's gonna be like, 'This next person will be a footnote in history at best.'"
"Bernie Sanders endorsed Hillary Clinton this afternoon and told his supporters that while he lost the primary, the revolution continues. Though I don't think he should have ended by saying, 'Seize her!'"

"Last week Donald Trump vowed to protect Article 12 of the Constitution despite the fact that the Constitution only has seven articles. Said Trump, 'I don't know. I don't read it for the articles.'"
"After weeks of speculation, Bernie Sanders this morning finally endorsed Hillary Clinton as the Democratic nominee. Which means that for the first time in over a year, Clinton can sit back and enjoy her status as the uncontested nominee. And knowing what we know about Hillary, here are some ways we think she's going to celebrate. She'll unbutton the very top button of her blouse, then re-button it. She'll let herself have that second Dove chocolate square."
"This morning Bernie Sanders endorsed Hillary Clinton. So, as promised, this afternoon the Clinton campaign released Bernie Sanders' wife. They let her go, and the deal went down."
"Over the weekend, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said, 'Donald Trump says whatever comes into his head.' To which Trump responded, 'That is not true, clam bucket pencil raft.'"
Bernie Sanders endorsed Hillary Clinton. Here's the problem. Bernie Sanders' endorsement of Hillary Clinton has angered many of his supporters. Many of them are threatening to not vote for her when they don't vote in November.
"[On Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's comments about Donald Trump] However she feels, Supreme Court justices are not supposed to influence our presidential elections until there is a recount in Florida."

Said Hillary Clinton, 'Ugh, I would kill for reviews that good.'"
"[Referring to some House Democrats' reaction during a recent meeting with Sen. Bernie Sanders, when he sidestepped a question about endorsing Hillary Clinton] They booed Bernie Sanders? Do you think Bernie Sanders is going to care if you boo him? Bernie probably goes to Broadway shows and boos from the balcony."
"The Republican Party is coming out strongly against online pornography. Man, they really do not want to win this election."
"Ever since the damning FBI report about Hillary Clinton's private email servers came out, her poll numbers have not looked good. Though the truth is she may have much better numbers hidden on her private server. We don't know."
"[On recent poll results from Ohio and Pennsylvania] Trump is currently getting zero-percent support from black voters. Zero! So, obviously every poll has a margin of error, so it can actually be negative three percent. We don't know."
"[On Trump's VP shortlist] It came down to three choices:New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence and former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich. A diverse group, if you go by bowling ability."
"You may know Mike Pence from not knowing who Mike Pence is, but Indiana Gov. Mike Pence is no stranger to headlines. Headlines like, 'Who is Indiana Gov. Mike Pence?'"
"[On Donald Trump's apparent choice of Pence as his running mate] According to the New York Times, Pence is someone who is unlikely to embarrass Trump. Which raises the question:Is there anything that can embarrass Trump?"
You might remember Gov. Pence from his previous role - disapproving dad in every sports movie.

"According to a poll that just came out, Donald Trump is getting zero percent of the black vote in some states. Zero percent of the black vote. Trump said, 'Don't worry, by the time the election comes around, I'll double that.'"
"Britain has a new foreign secretary, and the foreign secretary once likened Hillary Clinton to a sadistic nurse. ... After hearing this, Bill Clinton said, 'Man, I wish.'"
"In the last 24 hours, we have learned so much about Governor Pence, for instance, that he currently has a 40 percent approval rating in his state. So Trump could win Indiana just because voters want Pence out of there."
"But that's not the only big announcement coming out of the Trump campaign, because yesterday we learned who will be speaking at the Republican National Convention. And I was surprised to see Senator Ted Cruz got a speaking slot. During the campaign, Cruz called Trump a 'moron,' and Trump gave him the nickname 'Lyin' Ted.' Now Cruz says he fully supports Trump... So I guess he was Lyin' Ted after all."
"It was announced yesterday that Bernie Sanders is working on a book that will come out the week after the election. Yeah, they've already got some good titles in mind. Check it out, first there's, 'Are You There God It's Me, Your Older Brother, Bernie.' Then there's 'Great Expectations Followed By Bitter Disappointment.' After that, there's 'The Pastrami And The Rye.' And finally there's 'Shut Up, Moon.' Could be a best seller."
We're live all week during Trump's convention because I want to be the very first one to announce the moment America becomes great again.

"Over on the Democratic side, Bernie Sanders gave a 23-minute speech at a conference last week after he endorsed Hillary Clinton, but he didn't mention her by name. So people had a pretty good idea who he was referring to when he mentioned 'Moneybags McPantsuit.'"
"Following Donald Trump's selection of Mike Pence as his running mate, Hillary Clinton tweeted that Pence is 'Donald Trump with a different haircut.' Coincidentally, Donald Trump with a different haircut was his first choice."
"Quicken Loans Arena, home to the NBA champion Cleveland Cavaliers, is hosting the Republican convention this week. And just like the Cavs' starting lineup, the convention is expected to have four black people."

"[On accusations that portions of Melania Trump's Monday speech at the GOP convention were plagiarized from Michelle Obama's 2008 speech at the Democratic Convention] The star of the convention last night, as you may know, was Melania Trump. She gave the speech of Michelle Obama's life last night."
So the speeches are very similar. But the Trump campaign insists she did not plagiarize; repeating things is how Melania learned to speak English.
"Personally, I don't think Mrs. Trump is to blame at all. I think her speechwriters are to blame, and yet no one has lost their jobs. If only there was someone in the Trump campaign who enjoyed firing people."
"[On the RNC voting process] As is tradition - if you've watched these conventions before, it happens the same way every time - each state voted, and as they did so, we learned all kinds of things that you normally can only get by opening 50 bottles of Snapple."
"And the moment Donald Trump secured the nomination, got the number of delegate voters - they sent him over the top - the celebration kicked off in style with a giant gold screen that declared, 'Over the top!' Which was either declaring victory or indicating the direction Trump combs his hair."
"[Mimicking House Speaker Paul Ryan] Yes, we're going to restore law and order and many, so many other things! 'Law and Order:Criminal Intent,' 'Law and Order:Special Victims Unit.' They're all good shows."
"In their convention speeches, Donald Trump Jr. and Tiffany Trump both provided examples of how hard-working Americans just need to roll up their sleeves and be born into a billionaire's family."
[On Gov. Chris Christie's comments - in his GOP convention speech - about Hillary Clinton] Chris Christie promising terrifying show trials before a mindless screaming mob with no presentation for the defense - spooky or not spooky?

"Welcome, everybody. Before we start, I want to say that if any of these jokes sound old, it's because Michelle Obama used them in 2008."
"Chris Christie said it wasn't really plagiarism because it was 93 percent different than Michelle Obama's [speech]. So let that be a lesson, kids - cheating is wrong unless you're only doing it seven percent of the time."
"Meanwhile, Donald Trump's campaign manager, Paul Manafort, said today that Melania's speech was similar to Michelle Obama's because they must feel the same way about their families. And Melania said, 'Yeah, especially my daughters, Sasha and Malia.'"
"Of course, the convention's going on all week, and I saw that it actually has a different theme each night. That's right, the themes are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance."
"Delegates on the floor of the convention erupted when they were voting on the convention rules, and the chairman actually decided who won by who shouted louder. That's true. It's nice to see that they're deciding convention rules the same way they decide where to fire the t-shirt cannon at basketball games."
"Right now, the New York Times actually says that Hillary has a 76 percent chance of winning the election. Hillary said she's excited about the news and can't wait to find a new way to blow it."
"Hillary was actually campaigning in Las Vegas today, which is crazy, 'cause usually when Hillary gambles, it involves national security."
"Melania Trump is being accused of plagiarism because paragraphs of her speech last night closely mirror Michelle Obama's speech at the 2008 Democratic convention. Said Melania, 'That's ridiculous. I worked on that speech for four score and seven years.'"
"Donald Trump's former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, said today that whoever wrote Melania Trump's speech should be fired. 'Fine, I'll pack up my desk,' said Michelle."
"Each day, the Republican convention will center on a different theme, with today's being 'Make America Work Again,' as opposed to Monday's theme, 'Make Scott Baio Work Again.'"

"It should be noted, Trump entering the Republican convention to a song by Queen is like starting a KKK rally with 'Straight Outta Compton.'"
"I think the most unusual comments at the [Republican National Convention] last night were made by former Trump rival Ben Carson. Dr. Carson spoke with the clarity and eloquence of a prominent brain surgeon, who was successfully able to perform a lobotomy on himself."
"[On several members of the convention contracting the norovirus] The norovirus, if you don't know, is uncontrollable vomiting and loss of bowel control - it's basically what happens to Chris Christie every time he walks off stage after endorsing Donald Trump."
"Yes, Trump's plane flew right behind Cruz in the middle of Ted Cruz's rally. It really makes you wonder, 'Why is Ted Cruz still holding rallies?'"
"[On Ted Cruz not endorsing Donald Trump during his convention speech] He was the prime-time speaker and he did not endorse the candidate. That's like being the best man at a wedding and toasting the groom by saying, 'Hey, buddy, you'll find a good one eventually.'"
"[Mocking a comment made by Eric Trump.] Yes, 'ahead of schedule.' Donald Trump will end America sooner than we thought."
"[Mocking a remark made by Gov. Mike Pence in his convention speech] Yes, 'weakness arouses evil.' And America must be strong or we'll be surrounded by evil boners."
"We learned a lot about Pence's background - his family, his accomplishments, and beliefs. No question was left unanswered, except for one:who's Mike Pence again?'"
"Gov. Mike Pence was born in Columbus, Indiana, one morning, when I believe lightning struck a jar of mayonnaise."
"Now, a lot of people are out there saying, 'I don't care about Mike Pence,' including Donald Trump."
"[On several members of the convention contracting the norovirus] For those of you who don't know, norovirus is a type of flu where the symptoms are fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, privilege, awkward dancing, and plagiarism."
But I've been thinking about it - I don't think anyone actually has the virus. I think they're using it as an excuse to leave because they're so bored.
"Ben Carson says that Hillary wrote a paper in college about a man who wrote a book who that had a dedication that mentioned Lucifer, and therefore Hillary worships Satan. Wow. I mean, Ben Carson must do yoga because that is quite the stretch."
"I saw today Donald Trump returned to Cleveland ahead of tomorrow night's speech, and a lot people noted that Trump was greeted by his whole family when he landed, except for his wife Melania. Even weirder, Michelle Obama was there."
"[On Hillary Clinton apologizing for her use of a private email sever during her tenure as secretary of state] She said she's very sorry, that she made a mistake, and that it was the wrong thing to do. Hillary said it was actually easy apologizing, you know, after hearing Bill do it every day for 18 years."
"When asked about the accusation that Melania Trump's speech was plagiarized, Newt Gingrich told interviewers that he is disgusted with the media and believes they would not be so hard on a Democrat doing the same thing. For instance, when Michelle Obama gave the same speech in 2008, no one said a word."
"In response to Donald Trump becoming the Republican nominee, Paul Ryan said last night, 'Democracy is a series of choices. We Republicans have made our choice.' Though it was weird that he added, 'And may God have mercy on our souls.'"
[On Eric Trump's convention speech] It's tough to make a case against elites when you look like a money clip come to life.
"Still, Donald Trump must have been proud watching his son give that speech, or terrified, as Trump's nightmare might very well be a younger version of himself stealing the spotlight."
"Late apologies will probably be a hallmark of the Trump administration. I imagine only 24 hours after a nuclear holocaust, will a bunker-bound Trump look up to his few fellow survivors and say, 'My bad.'"
"[On Speaker Paul Ryan's convention speech] Paul Ryan's analogy for the craziest election ever is a customer service call? If this election is analogous to any kind of call, it's a 911 call you make on a dying cell phone with a weak signal while a killer chases you through the woods."
"[On the convention speeches of Ben Carson and Gov. Chris Christie] You know, after each Chris Christie line, the audience yelled 'guilty!' and after each Ben Carson line, they yelled, 'We don't quite follow you!'"
"At the Republican National Convention, Trump arrived atop a gold-plated elephant firing bedazzled 'Make America Great Again' t-shirts into the crowd. Not really, but it's kind of believable, right?"
"[On Sen. Ted Cruz not endorsing Trump in his convention speech] There were a lot of boos for Ted Cruz, and rightly so. I mean, how dare he not support the guy who berated him for months and insulted his wife and suggested his father may have murdered JFK. That's just rude."
"One of the reasons [Cruz] didn't voice his support for Trump, is because he reportedly plans to run for president again in 2020 - which, why not? It went so well this time around."
"[On Trump's official nomination as the Republican presidential candidate] Tonight was a historic moment, uniting America's political system, entertainment complex, and the self-tanner industry."

"[On Trump's comments about Hillary Clinton] That's right - she's going to change everything, and nothing will ever change! Make up your mind, Hillary! America needs to know why it hates you so much!"
"[On Trump wooing Sen. Bernie Sanders' supporters] If his supporters can't have Bernie, they'll go to Trump. Kind of like if you ask for a Coke, but they don't have it, you say, 'Then just fill my mouth with bees.'"
"[On talk of Laura Ingraham's wave resembling a Nazi salute] I don't actually think that Laura Ingraham was giving a Nazi salute, but it was a little suspicious, so she started her speech with, 'Can I get a heil yeah!'"
"[On Cruz not endorsing Trump] Okay, I guess Cruz might have two or three or 37 reasons not to endorse Trump."
"[On vice presidential nominee Mike Pence's physical appearance] I mean, it's like if drywall had sex with a bowl of oatmeal."
"Now I really like Trump and Pence's chemistry. Like, you can tell these guys have been friends since all the way back on July 18th of 2016."
"[On Cruz discussing his non-endorsement of Trump] In fact, Cruz said this morning that he won't be a 'servile puppy dog' for Trump. Then Chris Christie said, 'Whatever - more Beggin' Strips for me.'"
A lot of people are wondering why the Trump campaign would even invite Ted Cruz to speak at the convention in the first place. It turns out Ben Carson summoned him the night before by saying the word 'Lucifer' three times.
[Part of a list of hypothetical bipartisan compromises] Republicans support a wall at the border. Democrats support arts funding. So they compromised and now the wall will be built by third-graders out of paper mache.
The Democrats support special labeling for GMO foods. Republicans support teen abstinence programs. So they compromised and now teens have to wear labels telling everyone they're virgins.
The Republicans want to make people stop watching pornography. The Democrats want to protect wildlife in the national parks from tourists. They compromised and now they'll release a video of a buffalo humping a minivan.
The Republicans want to defund Planned Parenthood. The Democrats want to stop Donald Trump from preventing access to birth control. They compromised and now Planned Parenthood will hand out pictures of Donald Trump as birth control.
"Ivanka Trump introduced her father at the Republican convention tonight and said that he is color blind and gender neutral, which unfortunately under the new GOP platform means that Trump cannot use the bathroom anywhere."
"Ted Cruz spoke at the convention last night and was loudly booed because he refused to endorse Donald Trump for president. And I'm surprised to learn that Ted Cruz has a backbone, especially considering that he has no face bones."
"Following outrage that her husband did not endorse Donald Trump last night, Heidi Cruz was escorted from the Republican convention by security as people yelled 'Goldman Sachs.' Careful, Republicans - if you say it three times, Hillary will appear."
"Following Mike Pence's speech last night, Donald Trump joined his running mate on stage and appeared to make an air kiss gesture to him. And then Pence tried to send Trump to a gay reeducation camp."
[On Trump's acceptance speech] Trump talked about America like he was pitching a post-apocalyptic show to the Syfy Network.
[On Trump's pronunciation of LGBTQ] He said that like he was giving Pat Sajak letters for the 'Wheel of Fortune' final round.
"[On Trump's comments about fixing airports] If Trump gets elected, the airports are going to be pretty crowded. 'Yes, a one-way ticket to anywhere, please. Anywhere.'"
"Last night was the end of the Republican National Convention, and now it's the time for the Republicans to sit back, reflect and say, 'Well, that was weird.'"
"The Republican National Convention came to a close last night, as Donald Trump formally accepted his nomination for president. Although I thought it was a little much that they did it by Paul Ryan giving him a rose."
"Donald Trump released some of his remarks ahead of his big speech last night and presented himself as the champion of the forgotten men and women of our country. Then he said, 'And if you don't believe me, just look at all the has-beens that appeared on 'Celebrity Apprentice.'"

"I saw that 'Earth, Wind and Fire' tweeted that the convention's use of their song 'September' was unauthorized. Not because they disagree with the Republican Party's policies - they disagree with the Republican Party's dancing."
"Tonight was the start of the [Democratic National Convention] in Philadelphia, where today the temperature was over 100 degrees. As if Hillary Clinton needed another reason to sweat."
"It was over 100 degrees on the first day of the Democratic convention. In fact, it was so hot Hillary met with some Bernie supporters just for the chilly reception."
This DNC scandal just keeps getting worse. Have you heard the latest now? Turns out that they rigged it so Hillary would catch all the Pokemon.
"There were almost 20,000 Democratic Party emails leaked over the weekend. Actually, people were even more shocked to find out there were 20,000 emails Hillary hadn't deleted yet."
"During [an] interview, Hillary...said that her campaign is all hands on deck, and said, quote, 'We're going to have a cracker jack staff.' You could tell Hillary has a cracker jack staff when it's filled with nuts and disappointing surprises."
"Over on the Republican side, Donald Trump just posted an ad bragging that 33 percent of his speech at last week's Republican convention was actually applause. While 33 percent of Melania's speech was actually Melania's."
"We may be seeing more Trumps in politics. In fact, Donald Trump's son, Donald, Jr., told CNN he hasn't ruled out running for mayor of New York next year. When she heard that, Hillary Clinton turned to Chelsea and said, 'Clear your schedule.'"
"DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz has announced she will step down this week after hacked emails revealed that Democratic Party officials conspired against Bernie Sanders' White House bid. When reached for comment, Wasserman Schultz reportedly said 'Ack.'"

"Big Democratic convention this week. Hillary Clinton's main task this week apparently is to divert attention from leaked DNC emails. Analysts say that's the goal. Hillary is expected to start her speech with, 'Hey, look, there's a Pokemon.'"
"Earlier tonight, Bernie Sanders spoke at the Democratic National Convention. ... Sanders' speech was interrupted by dozens of applause breaks and three pee breaks."
"According to a poll, 90 percent of Bernie Sanders' supporters plan to vote for Hillary Clinton in November. The other 10 percent plan to put their hand down the sink and then turn on the disposal."
"It's going to be 96 [degrees] in Philadelphia, where the Democratic National Convention is happening. The theme for the Democrats today was, 'United Together.' Which really is the best way to be united - together. So much better than being united apart."
"After the Republican convention last week, [the] DNC was supposed to be the boring one. It was quite the opposite. Every time Hillary Clinton's name was mentioned, there were boos from Bernie Sanders fans. Some of these people are apparently unaware Bernie Sanders passed away six weeks ago."
Even Bernie had to ask his supporters to calm down - after a year of telling them not to calm down. It's like Chef Boyardee telling people to take it easy on the ravioli - it doesn't work.
The outrage that people are getting mad [about] intensified after Wikileaks released thousands of hacked emails where Democratic National Committee staffers exchanged ideas how to weaken the Bernie Sanders campaign to help the Hillary Clinton campaign. Maybe the Democrats need to stop using email. It might be time to bring carrier pigeons back.
"There are reports Russians have hacked the [DNC] servers, looking at information for a year. If Russia did do this, I think we start making them villains in our action movies again. It's time for Sylvester Stallone to get back to work."

"In one leaked email, a DNC staffer suggests attacking Sanders' faith, wondering 'Can we get someone to ask his belief? Does he believe in a God? He had skated on saying he has a Jewish heritage. I think I read he is an atheist. This could make several points difference with my peeps.' Of course, peeps are very religious. Those little marshmallow chicks never miss an Easter Sunday."
"Yesterday, [DNC Chairwoman Debbie] Wasserman Schultz said she plans to step down at the end of the convention. What? That's like people finding out that there's a turd in the punch bowl and telling them, 'Don't worry, we're getting rid of the turd as soon as the party's over. Until then, drink up! I promise! We're talking, at most, four days of turd punch.'"
"[On Michelle Obama's convention speech] She noted that she and her husband wake up every day in a house built by slaves, to which Donald Trump replied, 'Really? Can I get the name of your contractor?'"
It was a big night for Bernie Sanders [at the Democratic convention]. You could tell because for the first time ever it appears that he combed his hair.

"Eva Longoria also spoke last night and said, quote, 'A Latina from South Texas is introducing the first black senator from New Jersey on the week we nominate our first woman candidate for president.' And everyone at home playing a convention drinking game passed out."
"But now that we're into the general election, Hillary Clinton's really starting to go after Donald Trump. In fact, yesterday she called Trump's border wall a, quote, 'imaginary wall.' Which would be funny, if a year ago we weren't talking about Trump's imaginary chances at actually being elected president of the United States."
"Democrats held a roll call vote today to formally elect Hillary Clinton as their party's nominee. Delegates had the option of voting either 'no' or, 'ugh, fine.'"
"[On Bernie Sanders supporters who say they won't vote for any other candidate] We are on the cusp of electing a racist demagogue, and that never ends well. I don't know which class you ditched to go to those Bernie rallies, but I have a feeling it was history."
"[On President Obama and Vice President Biden giving speeches at the Democratic convention] Now that we got all the boring speeches out of the way, here comes Uncle Joe Biden on a Harley with short shorts and no shirt on, firing everybody up."

Trump's whole campaign has been a giant bombshell. You think anybody's going to care that he deducts Melania as a business expense?"
"[On Trump not releasing his tax returns] Ordinarily, I'd say we shouldn't assume there's something damaging in someone's tax returns just because the person hasn't released them, but this is Donald Trump we're talking about. Do you honestly think that if those returned showed $1 billion worth of income from legitimate businesses and millions of dollars in charitable donations he wouldn't show them to us? Not only would he show them to us, he'd have them blown up and posted on the sides of aircraft carriers."

"[Comparing Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump] There are basically two life boats. One we've seen float. It's weathered many a storm and yes, it sprung a few leaks, metaphorically speaking.

And its name is Donald Trump, and it's somehow currently leading in the polls, people!"

"[On Trump asking a mother with a crying baby to leave his rally] If that crying baby wants to stay here, it needs to act like an adult. Because when we adults listen to Trump, we weep silently."
"[On Trump losing some ground in the polls] But Trump himself seems to be aware of the shifts in public opinion, which is why it seems like he's already building an excuse for a loss by saying the November election will probably be rigged.

I haven't seen anything like this since Charlie Sheen's 'Violent Torpedo of Truth' Tour."
"[Donald Trump] refused to endorse Arizona Sen. John McCain and refused to endorse Speaker of the House Paul Ryan in their upcoming primaries, even though both of them endorsed him. It's like 'The Real Housewives of Orange Face County.'"

"[On a news commentator discussing Trump's Second Amendment people comment] Well, you see, that's your first mistake:trying to combine logic with the Trump campaign. Yeah, you know who doesn't do that? Donald Trump. He just rides the wave of crazy and sees where it takes him."
"Oh, of course. It all makes sense now. The Second Amendment people have an extremely powerful weapon:votes - which they shoot out of their guns."

"The Boston Globe just reported that according to his campaign staff, Donald Trump wouldn't take any vacations as president. I think that's because he's offended so many other countries he can't leave this one."
"Hillary Clinton cited an old Mexican proverb in her speech in Nevada today to highlight the unchanging nature of Donald Trump. A Mexican proverb, or as Trump calls it, 'a spell!'"
"At a rally in Mississippi last night, Donald Trump called Hillary Clinton a bigot because she, quote, 'sees people of color only as votes, not as human beings.' Hillary said, 'That's ridiculous, I love all people of color, whether they're black, Asian, or working class urban Latinos ages 35 to 50.'"
"At his rally today, Donald Trump said that people labeling him as a racist is a tired argument. You know things are bad when your only response to being called a racist is, 'Tell me something I don't know.'"
"According to a new poll, 62 percent of Republican voters would like Donald Trump to release his tax returns. And 58 percent would like him to release Mike Pence. That man has suffered enough."

"On Saturday, Hillary Clinton will receive her first official intelligence briefing as a candidate. ... Officials plan to tell Hillary about threats to US cyber security such as Russia, China, and her. That's the big three."
"Donald Trump's campaign is now saying he didn't change his immigration plan, he just changed the words he used to describe it. ... They also said Trump hasn't been married three times, he just changed the person he calls wife."
"The leader of England's Brexit movement spoke at a Trump rally, and he said, 'I wouldn't vote for Hillary if you paid me.' ... In other words, Hillary has lost the critical people-who-live-in-England vote."
"A producer for the VMAs says that apparently Rihanna is going to deliver a, quote, 'holy crap moment.' Donald Trump is like, 'Who cares? Try doing that twice a day, every day.'"
"Actually, Trump had a big week. In fact, the Washington Post published an entire biography of Donald Trump that's 431 pages long. Trump said it's a little longer than the books he likes to read by about 431 pages."
"The Trump biography also reveals that he doesn't have a computer at his desk in Trump Tower. Instead, every five minutes he just shouts at his secretary, 'Barbara, Google me.'"
"Donald Trump is trying to turn his poll numbers around and recently told his supporters that if he's elected, the White House will become the people's house. He was like, 'Because I ain't living in that dump.'"
"Donald Trump's doctor, Harold Bornstein...says he only took five minutes to write the letter claiming that Trump will be the healthiest person to ever be president. Only took him five minutes to write that. In the doctor's defense, if you walk in an exam room and there's a naked Trump, you'd be like, 'All right...yeah, no, yeah. Put your clothes on. Put your pants on. Get out of here.'"
Anthony Weiner is back in the news with another sexting scandal. He's like the Michael Phelps of sexting. He keeps saying he's going to retire - every four years he's back.
"Last night, Beyonce's album 'Lemonade' - about her husband's cheating - won seven awards. So the favorite to sweep next year is Huma Abedin."
Donald Trump is at it again. He's challenging Hillary Clinton to release detailed medical records. This marks the first time Trump has ever been interested in the body of a woman over 40.
And a 25-year-old has scammed over $1 million from Trump supporters. It's being called the first time in years that Trump has actually made someone money.
"Donald Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, spoke about Trump's new immigration policy over the weekend, and said he will ensure that enforcement is humane. Humane? I don't think it's a good sign when a candidate is talking about undocumented immigrants the same way KFC talks about chickens."
Hillary Clinton has begun pledging $30 billion over the next decade to retrain coal miners to be able to work in newer technology businesses. So get ready for an interesting trip to the Apple store.
"Donald Trump's recent claim that Hillary Clinton may be suffering from a secret ailment seems to have backfired on him, which has led to questions about his own health as well as a re-examination of the very strange letter written by Trump's doctor, Dr. Harold Bornstein, several months ago. Which read in part, 'If elected, Mr. Trump, I can say unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.' Then this week, Dr. Bornstein said that he wrote the letter in five minutes while Trump's limousine waited outside to pick the letter up."
"With this happening again, my heart goes out to Weiner's wife and Hillary Clinton's right-hand woman, Huma Abedin. You know what they say:Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. Fool me three times...'Dammit Anthony!'"
"We're now less than a month away from the first presidential debate. And get this - Donald Trump's campaign manager says that unlike most candidates, Trump may not practice beforehand with mock debates. That's because he plans on doing all his mocking at the debates."
"Anthony Weiner's wife, Huma Abedin, has decided to finally separate from him after his latest sexting scandal. So, ladies, he's single. Donald Trump even weighed in on all this, saying our national security may have been compromised by the scandal, because Weiner's wife had access to Hillary's security briefs. I wouldn't worry, though, because Weiner's only sharing stuff that's in his own briefs."
"We're going to have presidential debates soon. Both candidates are practicing for the debates and according to insiders, Hillary Clinton is still trying to find a stand-in for Donald Trump. So far, the best she's come up with is a car alarm stuffed inside a rotting pumpkin."
"Speaking of Trump, Sunday in California, several dozen Latinos held a rally for Donald Trump. They were a group calling themselves 'Latinos Who Don't Really Follow The News.'"
"In other election news, Arizona and Florida are holding primaries today. Arizonans are voting for either John McCain or Kelly Ward, while Floridians are voting for either bath salts or meth."
"Hillary Clinton spoke yesterday about her preparation for the upcoming presidential debate and told reporters, quote, 'I do not know which Donald Trump will show up.' Will it be the kind, generous, intelligent Donald Trump, or will it be the one who exists?"
"Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said in an interview today that Donald Trump's focus on a border wall is because a wall is something very easy for people to understand. Whereas, tax returns, super complicated."
"That's right, Trump is focusing on a border wall, because a wall is something very easy for people to understand. But not if it comes from Ikea."
"A new poll shows Hillary Clinton in an eight-point lead over Donald Trump in Pennsylvania, and boy did she work hard to win over those voters. Because most of the population of Pennsylvania is Amish."
"A new report this week shows an emerging pattern of Vladimir Putin critics mysteriously dying over the last two years. Said Putin, 'I can explain, I can explain. I killed them.'"

"On September 26th, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton will face off in a debate at Hofstra University. The Clinton campaign is using psychology experts to create a personality profile of Trump to figure out what his approach might be. Which I don't know, are they preparing for a debate or trying to catch the Zodiac killer?"
"Hillary Clinton said, 'I'm not taking anything for granted, I don't know which Donald Trump will show up.' She's right, it could be the Donald Trump we see on cable news, could be the Donald Trump we see at these rallies, it could be Donald Trump Jr. Technically, still a Donald Trump."
"Hillary's plan is reportedly to try to bait Trump into saying something that will get him into trouble. They're said to believe he's most insecure about his intelligence, his net worth, and his image as a successful businessman."
"The first presidential debate is now less than one month away, and apparently the candidates have two very different ways of preparing. Hillary Clinton pores over briefing books, thick with policy arcana and opposition research. She rehearses over and over again to perfect the pacing and substance of her presentation. Of course, you know she's the perfect student. 'Uh, I'll answer your question, Mr. Moderator, but may I point out, you forgot to give us any homework today.'"
"Meanwhile, Donald Trump is all about spectacle. One former aide said, 'Trump wants to be a showstopper in the Roman Coliseum, the main event at WrestleMania.' Which makes sense, since just like pro wrestling, you look at Trump's campaign and say, 'That's got to be fake!'"
"[Referring to reports that hackers breached election systems in some US states] I can't believe our election has been hacked. ... Folks, we cannot let the Russians mess with presidential elections. Next will be something important like 'The Voice.'"
"Today, Donald Trump made a surprise trip to Mexico for a meeting with the country's President Enrique Pe?a Nieto. Or as Trump put it, 'Nice to meet you, Eric Pi?ata.'"
"Of course, Trump's meeting today is his big chance to convince Mexico that they should pay for his proposed border wall. I think he might have a tough time. ... When Hillary saw that Trump was in Mexico, she said, 'I'll pay for the wall.'"
"I saw that a reporter went through Hillary Clinton's schedule while she was secretary of State and found that she and Bill were often away from each other, sometimes even on different continents. When asked why they didn't try to coordinate their schedules, Hillary said, 'Oh, we did.'"

"Today, the President of Mexico hosted Donald Trump. ... It was just another example of a Mexican doing a job that Americans don't want."
"After insulting Mexico for the past year, Donald Trump was in Mexico today. Things got awkward when he made a speech that started out, 'Hola, rapists.'"
"According to a new poll that just came out, Hillary Clinton is more unpopular than ever, but still not as unpopular as Donald Trump. ... So this election is kind of like asking people if they'd rather have chlamydia or gonorrhea."
"Donald Trump traveled to Mexico today to meet with President Enrique Pe?a Nieto, and said Trump, 'Wow, this place has more illegal immigrants than we do.'"
"Donald Trump and Mexican President Enrique Pe?a Nieto held a joint press conference this afternoon where Trump said the two did discuss his proposed border wall, but did not address payment for its construction. Said Trump, 'You know me, I don't like to talk about money.'"
"According to a poll released yesterday, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are now equally unpopular with registered voters. They're so unpopular, voters have begun cropping them out of their selfies."
Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway today accused Hillary Clinton of engaging in psychological warfare after it was reported that Clinton is preparing for the upcoming debates by working with psychologists. While Donald Trump is working with their patients.
"And according to a new report, the IRS discovered more than one million Americans have had their Social Security numbers stolen by undocumented immigrants. On the bright side, that means there's a real chance somewhere in America there's an illegal immigrant going by the name Donald J. Trump."
"New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie vetoed a bill yesterday that would have increased the state's minimum wage to $15 an hour, something he'll regret when he moves on to his next job."
"Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine yesterday attacked Donald Trump's reluctance to disclose his health and financial history, saying, 'When candidates are on the up-and-up, they have no problem disclosing information.' To which Hillary Clinton said, 'Shut up, stop talking about this sort of stuff.'"
"Donald Trump had quite a day. He took a quick jaunt to Mexico today to meet with President Pe?a Nieto. The Mexican president invited Trump to visit and Donald took him up on it, which had to be a surprise. It's kind of like when you invite a second cousin to your destination wedding - you hope he won't actually show up. But he did show up."
"Things got off to an awkward start when Pe?a Nieto came out to greet Donald Trump, and Trump handed him his keys."
"Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton, from a likability standpoint, has hit a new low. According to a new poll, 56 percent of Americans have an unfavorable view of the Democratic candidate for president, which puts her somewhere between pop-up ads and the Zika virus."
"And while that must certainly be of concern to the Clinton campaign, that same poll shows Donald Trump with an unfavorability rating of 63 percent, seven points higher than her. Maybe we should agree to not elect anyone. Do we really need a president? I'm pretty sure those Thanksgiving turkeys can pardon themselves, right?"
"Right now, there are only two Americans with a higher unfavorable rating than Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump - Chris Brown and Ryan Lochte."
"Trump was invited to Mexico by their President Enrique Pe?a Nieto, which is a little strange since Nieto has previously compared Trump to Hitler and Mussolini. Which explains why the invitation asked Trump to choose chicken, fish, Hitler or Mussolini."
"Now, I am surprised really that Trump would go someplace so dangerous. And I don't mean the drug gangs. I mean people down there love hitting Trump-shaped pi?atas, and this was their chance to find out if he is actually full of candy."
"In a surprising new development in this presidential election, today Donald Trump made a last-minute trip to Mexico to meet with Mexican President Enrique Pe?a Nieto. And you just know that as soon as Trump crossed into Mexico, Hillary Clinton was like, 'Okay, let's get cracking on that wall.'"
"Speaking of the wall, there's already some controversy. Because the Mexican president is saying that he told Trump that Mexico would not pay for the wall. While Trump says they never discussed who would pay for it. Now, in Trump's defense, whoever has gone down to Mexico and remembered what they did?"
"But if you are feeling frustrated with Trump's Mexico antics and you're not quite sold on Hillary Clinton, luckily there's another presidential candidate who has been making her voice heard, and that's Green Party candidate Jill Stein. Now, if you don't know who Jill Stein is, just picture Bernie Sanders, and now picture the woman in the back of his rally selling dream catchers."
"[On Trump's immigration speech] So really, it's a two-step plan. Step one, he takes office. Step two, all the illegals are gone."
"He also said there will be no amnesty for immigrants who come into this country illegally, which is very bad news for his next three wives."
"Hey, did you all see that big Trump speech last night? Man, I have not seen that many angry white people since they cancelled a Coldplay concert."
"Now, people are calling this a speech, but that implies Trump spoke. He really screamed, so I'm going to call this a screech."
"I'm starting to think there might be more than one Donald Trump. Here's my theory:Trump is actually three Oompa Loompas standing in a human pyramid inside his suit - one here, one there, and they take turns on who gets to be a head. One of them is reasonable, two of them really don't like immigrants. It would explain all his policy reversals and his skin tone."
"Yes, America has the right to choose immigrants who love us. And Donald Trump knows they're out there. He's already married two of them."
"Yes, Mexico doesn't know it yet, but they're going to pay for the wall. Here's what [Trump is] going to do:he's going to sneak it into the dinner check."
"A lot of people have said it's impossible to deport 11 million illegal immigrants, so Trump's only going to do two million in the first hour. It helps to break down a big task into manageable chunks."
"[On Trump's promises of extreme vetting of incoming immigrants] So extreme! There's going to be underwater paperwork, citizenship tests on a skateboard. Nobody gets in unless they can complete the 'American Ninja Warriors' course. And as always, our extreme vetting will be sponsored by Mountain Dew Baja Blast."
"Turning to the 'where are they now' file. Hillary Clinton is still running for president. She's been keeping something of a low profile, raising some money. It could be because of the scandals that continue to swirl around the Clinton Foundation, the non-profit charity that she and Bill set up to ensure that future generations would have an ample supply of Clinton scandals."
"As bad as this all looks for Bill and Hillary, the investigation 'did not reveal anything illegal' - which, at this point, really should be Hillary Clinton's campaign slogan."
"Donald Trump gave a big speech on immigration last night. And during the speech, he said that Mexico is 100 percent going to pay for his, quote, 'Beautiful border wall.' Mexicans were like, 'Wait, you never said it was going to be beautiful. Who do we write the check out to?'"
"Last night, Donald Trump said if he's elected, he will employ a deportation task force. Yeah, it's not really necessary, because if he's elected, most people will probably leave voluntarily."
"In his speech last night, Donald Trump proposed new screening to prevent violent extremists from entering the US. ... In response, Trump's supporters said, 'But we're already here.'"
"Last night, Donald Trump proposed a strict screening test for all prospective immigrants. Trump said the test would include questions about religious and political beliefs as well as a swimsuit competition."
"A prominent Latino Trump supporter announced today he is withdrawing his support for Donald Trump. ... He said, 'I would have done it sooner, but I just came out of a year-long coma.'"
"A new poll reveals that supporters of both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are motivated by fear, not excitement. And third-party candidate Gary Johnson supporters are motivated by being related to Gary Johnson."
The Actors' Equity Association just announced that it's endorsing Hillary Clinton. Hillary said she has a lot of respect for actors because she has been auditioning for the same role for 25 years.
Paul McCartney and Jon Bon Jovi sang 'Hey Jude' at Hillary Clinton's fundraiser this week while she danced with Bill. Hillary and Bill said they were excited to dance to the song until they realized that 'Hey Jude' is over seven minutes long.
"And Politico reports that in 2008, Donald Trump ventured into a mixed martial arts business that blended boxing, wrestling, and karate. You can tell he's pretty into prize fighting. In fact, he's been trying to give the upcoming election a catchy nickname like 'The Thrilla in Manila' or 'Rumble in the Jungle.' Let me give you a few examples. First up, there's 'The Hair Versus the Square.' Next we have 'The Tan Brute vs. the Pants Suit.' Finally, I think this is the one he's going to go with:'Mr. Cheeto vs. Mrs. Delete-o.'"
"Did you see Donald Trump dancing at the gospel church? Donald Trump this weekend, as part of his new initiative to woo African-American voters, visited the Great Faith Ministries Church in Detroit. He said he was there to listen. And I don't know what he was listening to, but based on his dancing, it clearly wasn't music."
After three weddings you'd think he'd have learned how to dance.
"I bet if you asked him if he's a good dancer he'd say, 'Yeah, I'm the best, nobody dances like me.' And it's true, nobody does dance like that."
"So Trump was at this church this weekend with Omarosa and Dr. Ben Carson - AKA, the two black people he knows."
"Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton claims she's really concerned that Russian President Vladimir Putin is trying to interfere with our election. She said, 'If you find a turtle on a fence post, it didn't get there by itself.' Dr. Phil is here tomorrow - I'm going to ask him what the hell that means."
"I know who didn't have a good weekend, was President Obama. He flew to China for Labor Day, because he wanted to see where American labor went."
"[On Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte's comments about President Obama] Look, I don't know how they do things in the Philippines, but over here we do not attack the woman who gave birth to the President, okay? We attack where she gave birth to him."
"Speaking of Hillary, have you heard about the latest FBI report on her emails? Probably not, because they put it out the Friday before Labor Day. You can't hide that news more if you welded it inside a lead capsule and fired it into the heart of the sun."
"And one of the big revelations of this latest email dump is that Secretary Clinton didn't use just one smartphone in office as secretary of state, as she originally claimed. She used up to 13 different mobile devices in four years. Thirteen cell phones! Madam Secretary, tell the truth. Are you a crack dealer? Because I can't figure out why else you would need 13 phones."
[On Trump's dancing at Great Faith Ministries Church] Trump doesn't just look like somebody who's never attended an African-American church. He looks like somebody who's never heard music before.
"Yesterday in China, President Obama had a meeting with Vladimir Putin. And before they started, Obama texted Michelle, 'Going into a meeting, love you,' while Putin texted the same thing to Donald Trump."
"A lot of people were saying President Obama was snubbed by China when they didn't have the stairs ready for him to get off the plane. In fact, Donald Trump said that if that ever happened to him, he'd just close the plane doors and leave the country. Then every other country was like, 'That's all we have to do? Thank you. That's perfect!'"
The latest CNN poll has Donald Trump beating Hillary Clinton 45 percent to 43 percent. But the good news is the staffer who informed Hillary is expected to make a full recovery.
"Trump has a well-documented history of stoking racial resentment and attracting the support of white nationalists, but apparently he is hoping he can overcome all that by going to a church in Detroit and awkwardly swaying back and forth like a dad who brought his kids to a Demi Lovato concert."
[On Ben Carson checking his phone during the church service] It's not a good sign when Trump's most prominent black supporter gets caught acting like a white teenage girl.
"[On a Trump surrogate's taco trucks on every corner comment] Taco trucks on every corner? You can't threaten people with something they actually want. I mean, this is America. The only thing we love more than tacos are tacos that come to us."
[On Donald Trump's plan to defeat ISIL] So the plan is to tell the generals to come up with a plan? Why didn't anyone think of that years ago?
Thirty days. Is this a plan to beat ISIS or a Sandra Bullock movie? Because thirty days - he's running for president like he's running a Domino's Pizza franchise.
"Over the summer, Donald Trump was way behind, but a new CNN poll has him up by two points nationally. Now, I'm not sure how that happened, I'm not sure how that happened. I'm going to say angry white men have started to reproduce asexually."
"[On Trump's attorney tweeting a picture of a cloud resembling Trump] Yes, God made a Trump-shaped cloud, though the cloud actually holds a position longer than the real Donald Trump can."
"[On Rep. David Jolly (R) bringing a jar of mosquitoes to Congress] I also feel like Congressman Jolly inadvertently came up with a solution here, because all he has to do is lock the doors of Congress, smash his Zika jar, then we'll see how quickly Congress can work."
"Donald Trump just revealed that he's not practicing for the upcoming debates in a traditional way and has not been using a stand-in for Hillary, which explains why today I saw Trump at Ann Taylor Loft yelling at a mannequin."
"Hillary said yesterday there's so much speculation about her, she's probably created a lot of jobs at the, quote, 'conspiracy theory factory.' Then conspiracy theorists were like, 'I knew there was a factory.'"
"The New York Times reports that the Obamas could make $45 million from book deals after leaving the White House. And believe it or not, the President's already got one book finished. It's called, 'Are You There, Golf? It's Me, Barack.'"
"Jessica Alba's Honest Company is selling bipartisan diapers, featuring the Democratic donkey and the Republican elephant holding hands. Because at the end of the day, both Republicans and Democrats are basically full of the same thing."
"Donald Trump said this afternoon that Hillary Clinton's foreign policy plans are 'reckless, trigger-happy, and very unstable.' Then he said, 'Oh, wait, wait, hold on, yep, yep, my bad, these are mine, these are mine.'"
"Hillary Clinton's running mate, Tim Kaine, criticized Donald Trump yesterday during a speech in North Carolina, saying the prospect of Donald Trump as commander-in-chief 'scares him to death.' Then again, look at Tim Kaine - you could scare him to death with a bicycle bell."
"Donald Trump said last night that on his first day in office he would give top military brass 30 days to submit a plan to defeat ISIS, and then whoever submits the best plan would move on to the final round."
"[On a Clinton aide saying he smashed two of her old BlackBerry devices with a hammer] Now, to be fair, those were BlackBerrys, and anyone who has ever used a BlackBerry has wanted to smash it with a hammer."
"Trump and his daughter Ivanka each gave $500 to [Florida AG Pam] Bondi's campaign in the fall of 2013 as well. Because everyone knows there's three things Ivanka Trump cares about:the real estate business, high-end fashion, and down-ballot Florida politics."
"Last night, Matt Lauer interviewed Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton back-to-back in front of a crowd of American veterans, and the winner - at least, according to the polls - the leader who came off as strongest and best last night was Vladimir Putin."
"Donald Trump loves Vladimir Putin. After all is said and done, even if he doesn't become president, at the very least, Donald Trump is going to have amazing sex with Vladimir Putin."
The one guy Donald Trump has nothing bad to say about is Vladimir Putin. Maybe he's afraid Putin will cut off his supply of wives.
"[On Gary Johnson's What is Aleppo? comment] I hate to say it, but that could cost him the election. Ironically, the thing that finally put Gary Johnson on the map is not knowing the map."
"[On NBC's Commander-In-Chief Forum] Last night, they held like a mini-debate, like an appetizer debate. ... It took place right here in New York, on the aircraft carrier Intrepid. After Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump were on board, a lot of people were tempted to just cut the lines and let it drift out to sea."
"[On Trump's plan for ISIL] Just to recap, he has a plan he hasn't come up with, but if the generals bring him a plan that's similar to the plan he doesn't have, he may go with that plan, which he can't tell us about because it's a secret plan that he does not have. Make America great again."
"[Mocking Matt Lauer] Sorry, Secretary Clinton, foreign policy is like pizza delivery. If you can't get your plan out in 30 seconds or less, Russia gets a free Ukraine."
"[Mocking Gary Johnson's What is Aleppo? commen] Got it, got it, got it. Aleppo. Aleppo. I thought you said 'a leopard.' I was like, 'What would I do about a leopard? Probably run away from it.'"
"I haven't seen someone go blank like that since I was asked, 'Who is Gary Johnson?'"
"[On NBC's Commander-In-Chief Forum] The candidates decided who would go first with a coin toss. ? Donald Trump called heads, but just in case he lost, he also called the whole thing rigged."
"During World War II, on multiple occasions, kamikaze planes crashed into the Intrepid, and last night, Matt Lauer continued that tradition because I don't know what the [bleep] he was doing, and neither did he."
Matt Lauer was criticized from both sides for not being tough enough on the candidates on issues of national security. And I think Lauer tried to make up for it this morning by grilling Rachael Ray on how she'd defeat ISIS.
"It is fashion week, and I saw that during one interview, Kendall Jenner made the comment that Hillary Clinton might look good in a jumpsuit. And Hillary said, 'Well, hopefully they never find those emails, or it's going to be an orange jumpsuit.'"
"Actually, yesterday Hillary said that the media coverage of her campaign is frustrating, and that Donald Trump's campaign is being treated more favorably than hers. Then CNN said, 'Shh, Trump's about to tweet something.'"
"Now there's a conspiracy theory making the rounds online that Hillary Clinton was being fed answers through an earpiece during her town hall last week. She had a secret earpiece. Hillary said, 'I promise you it wasn't an earpiece or my name isn't...Hillary...Hillary.'"
"Donald Trump said this week that Vladimir Putin has been a leader far more than our President has been a leader. And he's got a point. I mean, if President Obama was as strong a leader as Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump would be dead by now."
"While Donald Trump often cites a quote in which Vladimir Putin allegedly called him brilliant, language experts are saying that the Russian word used does not mean brilliant in the terms of intelligent, but more like a bright light or colorfulness. You know, like a big neon sign that says, 'Moron.'"
"Fox News anchor Chris Wallace, who will be moderator for the final presidential debate of election season, said in an interview this week that he doesn't feel it's his job to call out the candidates when they lie. 'Super!' said Hillary and Donald at the same time."
"This week the presidential candidates have been focusing on national security, which in any other year could be a real weakness for Hillary Clinton, given her support for the war in Iraq. But, of course, her opponent is Donald Trump, who keeps finding ways to remind us he has no idea what he's talking about."
"Now, remember, Hillary supported the wars in Iraq, in Libya. She has a hawkish streak that deserves scrutiny and criticism, especially considering how wary many Americans have become of foreign military intervention. Fortunately for Hillary, she's running against an opponent whose main foreign policy experience is the time he invaded Scotland with a golf club."
"Guys, here's the latest on the election. Hillary Clinton had to walk back a comment she made about Trump supporters last week. A lot of people were really upset about this. ... So, if you're keeping track, Trump supporters are deplorable, and Hillary supporters are deportable."
"But of course, the big story right now is that Hillary was just diagnosed with pneumonia. And to everyone's surprise, Trump has refused to attack her while she's sick and even said that he hopes she feels better. At which point, people started asking Trump if he was feeling okay."
"I heard about a new movie coming out that chronicles President Obama's first year at Columbia University, called, 'Barry.' ... It's 104 minutes long, and that's just Obama introducing himself to his roommate."
"Hillary Clinton not feeling well. Here's the interesting thing - Donald Trump is being nice about it. That's right, Donald Trump said he wishes Hillary Clinton a speedy recovery from her 'New Mona.'"
"Some conspiracy theorists, and there are a lot of them out there. ... Some are claiming that Hillary Clinton is so sick that she's been using a body double. When Bill Clinton heard about it, he said, 'Man, I wish.'"
"After Hillary Clinton's health scare yesterday, Donald Trump said he'll release his medical records, and he said he's expecting some 'very large numbers.' Trump said, 'I'm going to show you a prostate that's huge! It's a huge prostate.'"
"Hillary Clinton upset Republicans this weekend after she accused half of Trump supporters of belonging to a 'basket of deplorables,' which is also Trump's usual order at KFC."
"RNC Chairman Reince Priebus spoke out against Hillary Clinton's attack on Donald Trump's supporters and said, 'Clinton's comments show outright contempt for ordinary people.' Then again, so does the name Reince Priebus."
"Hillary Clinton left the Ground Zero memorial service early yesterday because she felt overheated. Said Trump, 'Hey, if anyone's too hot, it's my daughter Ivanka.'"
"Following the announcement that Hillary Clinton has pneumonia, Sen. Chuck Schumer said today that he was also diagnosed with pneumonia several weeks ago. And Vice President Joe Biden also stepped up and admitted he is suffering from disco fever."
"Following the news that Hillary Clinton is suffering from pneumonia, Donald Trump has promised to release his own medical records. 'Wait, you wanted me to save those?' said his doctor."
"Green Party candidate Jill Stein said on Sunday that she would not have assassinated Osama bin Laden, but instead would have captured him and brought him to trial. I would say that would hurt her poll numbers, but she only has one."
"You probably know Hillary was coughing a lot in public last week, and then yesterday she was forced to leave a 9/11 memorial because she was feeling faint. Turns out, on Friday Clinton's doctor had diagnosed her with pneumonia, but they kept it secret until this happened, and they were forced to admit it. These conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton's health would be a lot harder to believe if they didn't actually come true."
It is kind of funny that the people who don't think Hillary Clinton is fit and healthy enough to be president are so worried that Hillary Clinton is fit and healthy enough to be president.
"While in New York, Hillary became overheated and had to leave an event to receive medical attention. It turns out that she had been diagnosed with pneumonia on Friday. I mean, this was a scary moment for Donald Trump, because he was thinking, 'Oh, God, I might actually have to be the president.'"
"But today on Fox News, Trump actually said, he said, 'I just hope she gets well and gets back on the trail.' I mean, forget Hillary, is Trump okay?"

"It has been a rough week for Hillary Clinton. She has been dropping in the polls, and over the weekend, even her immune system turned against her. No surprise - all the white blood cells are voting for Trump."
"What is a basket of deplorables, okay? It sounds like the worst-selling item at Edible Arrangements. Or maybe your cousin's suburban punk band. Or even better, maybe the Korean translation of the 'Minion' movie."
"Secretary Clinton, I know you're the candidate, but here's a tip:If you want to be president, don't call the American people names. I mean, even if you're elected, no one wants to hear, 'My fellow Americans, the state of our union is one-quarter douchebag.'"

"There's been a lot in the news about Hillary Clinton's recent bout of pneumonia. Hillary herself tweeted about it yesterday, saying, just like any sick person, she's 'just anxious to get back out there.' To me, that shows just how out of touch Hillary is with regular people. People don't want to go back to work. Nobody's in bed at 1:00 p.m. thinking, 'Oh man, I wish I was watching Linda's PowerPoint on how to fill out my expense reports.'"
"Luckily for Democrats, her recovery is going well. In fact, her doctors say she's doing so well that she'll be up and deleting emails in no time."

"Of course, the big story in politics continues to be Hillary Clinton's recovery from pneumonia, and yesterday, Hillary tweeted to her supporters that like anyone who's been home sick from work, she's 'just anxious to get back out there.' And those people said, 'No, we're pretty happy just staying home and watching Netflix. We don't want to get back out there.'"
"Meanwhile, sources say that Hillary has a tendency to get dehydrated, and her aides have a hard time getting her to drink more water. Or as the Trump campaign put it, 'Hillary has a drinking problem.'"
"Everyone just wants Hillary to rest and get better. In fact, yesterday, Joe Biden told some of Hillary's campaign workers that he's also had pneumonia before, and that if the doctor tells you to take three days off, you should actually take six days off. Of course, that advice only really works if your job is vice president."
"[On Democratic officials empathizing with Hillary Clinton by commenting on their own bouts with sickness] President Obama said, 'One time I had a stomach bug that sidelined me for almost a week.' And Bernie Sanders said, 'I've had my fair share of health issues that kept me out of the game. I've had consumption, scarlet fever, smallpox, hip gout. ... Don't even get me started about my bout with croup, lockjaw, trench foot. Something they call prairie shakes. ... I've also had tent fever, I had odor mold, loose neck. Remember bubonic plague?

"Donald Trump spent today campaigning in Iowa, and it was going great until somebody tried to husk him."

"Bill Clinton tried to dispel rumors yesterday about Hillary Clinton's health and said that she's almost certainly in better health than her opponent. I don't know, Trump definitely has higher levels of vitamins K, F, and C."
"Hillary Clinton tweeted yesterday that like anyone who's ever been home sick from work, she's anxious to get back on the campaign trail. Yeah, you do not understand ordinary Americans. Most people who are home sick from work are thinking, 'How long can I stretch this out?'"
"Hillary Clinton yesterday tweeted out a calculator to help voters figure out how much they would save on student loan payments under her college plan, and so Bill could spell 'boobs.'"
"If you're watching Fox News for information about the election, you might as well just cut out the middle man and ask mom what her Facebook friends are saying. 'You know Linda says that Hillary has been a ghost for ten years. I don't know, it has 54 likes.'"
You think Trump's schedule is harder because he talks off the top of his head for an hour-and-a-half? Hillary has to prepare an actual speech. Trump shows up in a hat and windbreaker like a hungover Little League umpire.
"I don't know if you heard the latest news, but a fistfight broke out at a Trump rally yesterday. ... Or, more accurately, a Trump rally broke out during a fistfight."

"Whatever you think about the Clinton Foundation, it has done real charity work - earthquake relief in Haiti, expanded access to HIV drugs in Africa, and one assumes working on a cure for secret pneumonia."
"In 2010, Trump got a trophy from the Palm Beach Police Foundation for his, quote, 'selfless support' of its cause. And that's unusual, because Trump usually marries his trophies."

"Tonight the main event from Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York:Donald Trump versus Hillary Clinton in the first of three presidential debates. It was a long 90 minutes, but the results are in. And not a single voter changed their mind."
It's very hard to believe that there are still undecided voters. The choice is pretty orange and white.
"This was expected to be the most-watched debate ever. The ratings were expected to rank up with the finale of 'Cheers,' the finale of 'MASH' - for real. Makes sense. In a way this election feels like the series finale of America."
"Let's come up for air. We all just watched Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton debate for an hour and a half. Coming into tonight's debate, Democrats were divided between two strong emotions:panic and pants-crapping. Democrats have not been this nervous since Anthony Weiner asked to borrow their phone."
"For Hillary to win, she had to be confident, not smug, knowledgeable without being know-it -all, charming but not affected, commanding but not shrill, likable, warm, authoritative and not coughing. Meanwhile, Donald Trump had to not commit murder."
"And that low bar was reflected in Donald Trump's debate prep. Instead of doing a bunch of mock debates, the word is that he sat down with friends over bacon cheeseburgers, hot dogs and glasses of coca-cola and tested out zingers. Wow! That's how Washington prepared for tonight's debate, too!"
"Meanwhile, Hillary was so prepared, my new nickname for her is Preparation H. In the primaries, she already proved she could soothe the burn."
"Donald Trump tweeted the concept of global warming was created for and by the Chinese to make US manufacturing noncompetitive. Look, in all fairness, there is a chance that tweet was created by the Chinese to make Trump non-competitive."
"Now, the whole point of this debate tonight, the main prize the candidates are vying over, is the elusive, undecided voter, and there are a lot of them. One in five people aren't sure who they will vote for. In fact, one in two candidates still isn't sure he wants to be president."
These are the two least popular candidates in history. That's including the 1892 contest between Oswalt the orphan strangler and Box Car Johnny Typhus.
"[On Monday's debate] They covered all the major topics - national security, the economy, Rosie O'Donnell, everything that needed to be covered."

"He said he wants to bring back stop-and-frisk, whereas Hillary wants to bring back 'stop, collaborate, and listen' as part of her Vanilla Ice initiative."

"After 90 minutes of watching these two go back and forth, I feel like Hillary and Donald might have irreconcilable differences. I don't think counseling is going to help them."
"After the debate there was another debate about who won the debate. Donald Trump, you're not going to believe this, he believes he won the debate. Not just the debate, he thinks he won the World Series and the Super Bowl, too."
"And today, everyone's trying to figure out who won [the presidential debate], which is kind of a silly question to ask, okay? Both sides are going to say they won. ? This isn't the Olympics, there are no judges. Because if there were, the Russians would have given Trump a 10."
"Before the debate, Politico analyzed a week's worth of Trump's speeches and found that 'Trump averaged about one falsehood every three minutes and 15 seconds.' Which is damning. Though, on the plus side, you can use Trump's lies to tell if your microwave popcorn is done."
"A lot of people said Trump didn't seem prepared, possibly because he was not. Apparently, Trump's advisors saw it as 'a waste of time to try to fill his head with facts and figures.' ? There's no room in there. It's already full of ethnic slurs and different wives' names."
"So the question is, once again, question of the day, who won? Again, impossible to know for sure, but the markets today thought Trump lost because the Mexican peso went up in value. ? That's good news for Mexico. Now it'll be easier for them to pay for the wall."
"[On Trump claiming to win a non-existent CBS poll] Yeah! He won the CBS poll, that's impressive. Except for the fact that CBS did not conduct a post-debate poll."
Just because it doesn't exist doesn't mean he didn't win it. He's doing very well in Narnia. He got a firm endorsement from the Lollipop Guild.
"[On Lester Holt as debate moderator] Lester! What the hell? Two minutes to heal the racial divide? 'Two minutes to heal the racial divide. After that, you have 30 seconds to explain why God took my nana. ? Why do bad things happen to good people? You have 15 seconds.'"

"Last night, there were nearly seven million tweets about the debate. And this was surprising - only five million of those were from Donald Trump."
"One thing a lot of people commented on was how Trump kept making sniffling sounds with his nose over and over during the debate. Now, I'm not sure what's causing Trump to sniffle. It's possible he's allergic to whatever animal has gently fallen asleep on top of his head."
"Former DNC chair Howard Dean tweeted last night - he tweeted, 'Notice Trump sniffling all the time. Coke user?' Because, if there's one guy who would know about a politician doing cocaine, it's Howard Dean."
"Not long after the debate, Trump began blaming his sniffling on the fact that his microphone was defective. And to be fair, there was a huge issue with Trump's mic - it was turned on."
"[On Trump saying he didn't know what to expect for the debate] He's like, 'You don't know what to expect. Are there going to be questions? Are there going to be people? I don't know! If only there was some way to know what was going to happen on the night.'"
"[On Trump entering the spin room after the debate] I know that if Trump becomes president there's a high possibility he'll destroy the world, but you have to appreciate these moments. The man was spinning for himself. That's the equivalent of giving a wedding toast at your own wedding."
[On the media saying Trump appeared 'restrained' during the debate] He was restrained? That doesn't sound like a presidential compliment. It sounds more like something the pre-school teacher says about a terrible kid on an okay day.
The debate had higher ratings than any other debate in US history. ? The ratings would have been even higher if it weren't for all the people covering their eyes.
"Of course, one of the issues that came up last night was Trump's personal wealth, but Trump defended himself, saying that he doesn't talk about how rich he is just to be, quote, 'braggadocious.' And he introduced his speechwriters, the Ninja Turtles."
"During last night's debate, Trump was complaining about our outdated military, and said that our B-52s are so old that your grandfather could be flying them. Because everyone knows nothing gets a debate crowd going like some old 'your B-52s are so old' jokes."

"Donald Trump told reporters today that he gives Hillary Clinton a C-plus for her performance in last night's debate. A C-plus? Then what was your grade, an H?"

"Fifty-one times he interrupted her, or as Melania Trump calls that, a quiet night."
"According to Forbes magazine, Donald Trump's wealth is down $800 million from last year. He's only worth $3.7 billion now. And I'll tell you something, Mexico is going to pay for it."
"But the good news is, while his net worth may be down, his self-worth is at an all-time high."
"I don't know about you, but I'm still detoxing from Monday's debate. ? That's like a two-day hangover. Kind of makes me want to drink again, actually."
"Everybody is trying to spin [the debate] their own way. You know, Donald Trump says all the polls show he won, and the polls say Hillary won."
"[On Trump saying he did nothing to embarrass Clinton] Trump's always acting like such a gentleman. He holds doors for women, gives them the seat on the bus, does no debate preparation. You might call it the addled ramblings of a delusional demagogue. Trump calls it chivalry."
"Now, these comments [about Alicia Machado] could really hurt Trump with the small special-interest group of Americans who gain weight."
"It's all part of Trump's new campaign slogan, 'Trump 2016:Seriously, ladies, you could lose a few pounds.'"
"The Taliban released a statement?calling Donald Trump a 'non-serious candidate who says anything that comes to his tongue.' ? The Taliban sees Donald Trump, and even they think he's crazy."

"Today, Hillary Clinton is campaigning with Bernie Sanders for the millennial vote. ... They're trying to get millennials with the opening line, 'Hey, our combined age is approximately one millennium.'"
"Donald Trump has a new scandal to deal with today. According to Newsweek, in 1998 Trump spent $68,000 on a business venture in Cuba, which was illegal because of our embargo with Cuba. Now Trump, of course, denied the allegations. He said there's no such place as Cuba."
"If these allegations prove to be true, this will absolutely not change a single mind of anyone that's watching. Honestly, at this point, the guy's unsinkable. If only they'd made the Titanic out of whatever he's made of, it would still be floating."
"We're still trying to figure out who won Monday's presidential debate. Democrats say Hillary won, while Republicans are strong in their conviction that there are still two more debates."
"Evidently, Trump's staffers tried to get Trump to practice before the first debate, but say 'Mr. Trump found it hard to focus during those meetings,' and 'he did not seem to pay attention during the practice sessions.' I don't blame Trump, I don't blame Trump at all. I mean, White House, Oval Office? That's colors AND shapes. Very difficult."
"Unlike his advisors, Trump isn't ready to concede defeat about last Monday's debate. He knows that a) he won, and b) he lost because it was rigged."
"During the debate, people noticed Hillary was wearing a device under her jacket that could have been a secret earpiece or a 'cough-prevention machine.' Yes, the well-known cough-prevention machine. It's Apple's new hip-mounted iron lung."
"Hillary's doing everything she can to attract young people right now. That's why, for the first time since July, she appeared on the campaign trail this week with that millennial heartthrob, Bernie Sanders. ? He really connects with millennials, because a lot of his clothes are also 18 to 30 years old."
"This election cycle, for any millennials disenchanted with Clinton and Trump, there's also Libertarian candidate and aging clown without makeup Gary Johnson."
"Just a few days ago, Johnson clarified his position [on climate change], saying that his long-term solution to global warming is that 'we do have to inhabit other planets.' I believe Gary Johnson already does."
"Gary Johnson seems like a bit of a masochist. ? According to The Economist, he once shut himself inside a freezer to prove he could withstand the cold, and he clamped an alligator clip onto his tongue to show he could withstand pain. Which means if he doesn't win the presidency, he's still got a good shot to be in the next 'Jackass' movie."

"While speaking to the students at the University of New Hampshire yesterday, Hillary Clinton said, quote, 'Isn't this one of the strangest elections you've ever seen?' And then college kids were like, 'Uh, we're 18. It's the only election we've ever seen.'"

"MSNBC announced it will be doing all-day coverage for Tuesday's vice presidential debate. That's right, a full day covering Mike Pence and Tim Kaine. Even the Weather Channel is like, 'That sounds brutal.'"

"The New York Times got their hands on a tax document from 1995 which shows Trump declared a $916 million loss that year, which would have allowed him to avoid paying any income tax for 18 years. The documents were sent to the Times from inside Trump Tower. The Trump campaign said the Times illegally obtained the documents, and we all know how much Donald Trump hates hacking. So that's no good."
"But still, the Trump campaign isn't denying the authenticity of the forms, which is remarkable, considering the fact that they deny almost everything. This morning they denied Trump is running for president."
"Well, it looks like this year we can all claim Donald Trump as a dependent. The New York Times has obtained documents showing Donald Trump reported a $916 million loss on his 1995 tax returns, which may have been a substantial enough loss to allow Trump to not pay taxes up to 18 years. That means Trump hasn't paid taxes since the year his next wife was born."
